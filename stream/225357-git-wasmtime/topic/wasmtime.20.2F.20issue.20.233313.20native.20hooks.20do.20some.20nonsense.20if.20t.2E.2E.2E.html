<blockquote>
<p>Thinking about this, the cases we're dealing with are:</p>
<ol>
<li>When "exiting native" by calling wasm, if that traps we never call "entering native" or anything else</li>
<li>When "entering native" by entering a host function, if that traps we currently don't call "exiting native" as we exit with the trap.</li>
<li>When the host function returns a normal trap in the implementation, it looks like <code>Func::new</code> doesn't call "exiting native" correctly, but <code>Func::wrap</code> does. </li>
<li>When "exiting native" by returning from a host function, if that traps we still call "entering native" on the other side.</li>
<li>When "entering native" by returning from wasm execution, if that traps we don't call anything else and just bail out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally I want the hooks installed into the <code>Store</code> to be simple and we track most other things for you in Wasmtime itself. I think the best way we can interpret this is with guidelines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a trap happen when "entering" a state, then the state isn't changed. In this case the "entering" isn't defined by the callback names today, but rather entering into wasm by calling it or entering native by calling a host function. </li>
<li>If a trap happens when "exiting" a state, then the state is still changed. (e.g. returning from a host call or returning from a wasm call).</li>
</ul>
<p>To model this we probably want to remove the enter/exit callbacks and instead have something like one callback which receives an enum describing what's happening. The enum would have 4 values of 1/2/4/5 above, and perhaps other options as well like "I'm exiting the host from a hostcall but a trap was returned there anyway". With that sort of modeling the behavior we need to update is:</p>
<ol>
<li>No change. By failing the "enter wasm" state you remain in "native" state, so no future callbacks necessary.</li>
<li>No change. By failing the "enter native" state we remain in "wasm", so no "exiting native" is necessary.</li>
<li>Needs a bugfix in <code>Func::new</code></li>
<li>No change. By failing the "exit host" state we still force entry into the "wasm" state, which means it's correct.</li>
<li>No change. By failing the "exit wasm" state we're still forced back into the native state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Does that make sense? I had to think about this for awhile... Basically I think we may want to change the interface from two callbacks to one-with-arguments where the arguments describe what's happening?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I really like the design change to one-with-arguments: the argument to describing whether the state transition is a call or a return fixes another ambiguity.</p>
<p>I also will change the function to take a <code>Caller</code>, instead of the state <code>T</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don't think we can pass a <code>Caller&lt;'_, T&gt;</code> without extra work to be done because the callback itself lives within the <code>Caller</code>, but is there a reason you think that the callback may need access to the whole store?</p>

<p>You're right, we dont have Caller available in all of these contexts. I thought it would be interesting to be able to inspect/modify fuel, but it doesn't make sense for this mechanism</p>
