<p>This is a follow up to a <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4997#discussion_r987218051">discussion we recently had about I-Cache maintenance</a>. I'm filing this as a separate issue since I would prefer to deal with this in a different PR than that one.</p>
<p>That PR cleans up our interface for I-Cache maintenance in a way that's hopefully not too AArch64 specific. In the process we noticed that RISC-V does not perform any I-Cache maintenance actions, despite the architecture not guaranteeing that it is cache coherent.</p>
<p>For AArch64 we do a <code>CORE_SYNC</code> membarrier, but from my look at the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/riscv/features.html">kernel docs</a> it looks like this operation is not yet available for RISC-V. They have a custom syscall that seems to do exactly what we want, but we should double check.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well sort of, yes, maybe. At a minimum we need to use the broadcast <code>fence.i</code> that executes that instruction on all threads for the current process (i.e. that custom syscall above). Also, that syscall is only guaranteed to clear the icache for a region of memory (despite being implemented as a global <code>fence.i</code>). That maps fairly well into the <code>clear_cache</code> interface that we now have after #4997.</p>
<p>But additionally the unresolved question is, does flushing the icache guarantee that it also flushes the pipeline?</p>
<p>On AArch64 it does not, thus we need an additional action, but maybe on RISC-V it does? </p>
<p>Reading the <a href="https://five-embeddev.com/riscv-isa-manual/latest/zifencei.html">ISA manual for <code>fence.i</code></a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A more complex implementation might snoop the instruction (data) cache on every data (instruction) cache miss, or use an inclusive unified private L2 cache to invalidate lines from the primary instruction cache when they are being written by a local store instruction. If instruction and data caches are kept coherent in this way, or if the memory system consists of only uncached RAMs, <strong>then just the fetch pipeline needs to be flushed at a FENCE.I.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine). I don't think this section is normative, but it indicates that that's the expected behaviour. That helps us with the current implementation. Calling the above syscall will almost certainly do everything that we want.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong> that syscall itself does  not guarantee that it flushes the pipeline since a possible future <code>fence.i</code> instruction may not behave this way. (i.e. when they introduce a <code>fence.i</code> for just an address range, maybe the pipeline flush won't be done there)</p>
<p>To my reading the <a href="https://five-embeddev.com/riscv-isa-manual/latest/rvwmo.html#ch:memorymodel">RVWMO Memory Consistency Model</a> does not clarify this, although I can barely understand it so....  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯</p>
<hr>
<p>TL;DR: We will almost certainly be fine calling the custom <code>riscv_clear_cache</code> sycall for now, and perhaps future revisions to the ISA manual will clarify this and we can update our implementation then</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I understand it the fence.i instruction will always be the correct way to handle modification of code. Depending on the cpu it may only flush the pipeline (if the instruction cache is coherent with the data cache) or also flush the instruction cache (if it isn't coherent), but the end result is the same: The instruction cache is brought in sync with the data cache and the pipeline is flushed.</p>
<p>As for the instruction cache flush syscall being guaranteed to flush the pipeline, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Right, I also think the <code>flush_icache</code> syscall will work. However, that syscall takes <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/4d1044fcb996e8de9b9ab392f4a767890e45202d/arch/riscv/kernel/sys_riscv.c#L64-L66">three arguments</a> which we need to pass.  It currently doesn't do anything with them but we still need to pass them.</p>
<p>It would also be nice if we could call the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5bfc75d92efd494db37f5c4c173d3639d4772966/arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/flush_icache.S#L10">vDSO implementation</a> which would be lot faster on single core systems since it would just call the <code>fence.i</code> instruction and be done with it (I'm not sure how hard it is to do this, so feel free to disregard it).</p>

<p>@afonso360  It is wired <code>SYS_RISCV_FLUSH_ICACHE_ALL</code> is same as <code>SYS_RISCV_FLUSH_ICACHE_LOCAL</code>.</p>
