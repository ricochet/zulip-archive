<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Enable the following to work:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Bash"><pre><span></span><code>wasmtime<span class="w"> </span>serve<span class="w"> </span>./my-component.wasm<span class="w"> </span>--profile<span class="o">=</span>guest
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>In general: profiling is useful and it's neat to be able to profile wasm components.</p>
<p>For me specifically though: I'm on MacOS and setting up native trace tools requires turning off security features in the kernel. I've not been able to do so successfully, so as a result I (somewhat embarrassingly) don't currently have a working <code>perf</code> command on my machine. Because wasmtime's guest profiler doesn't interact with the kernel at all, this seems like the ideal way to resolve it, basically by providing a portable, OS-agnostic profiling suite.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>There is a working guest profiler available already, but trying to run it on components gives the following error message:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Text only"><pre><span></span><code>Error: Cannot use the guest profiler with components
</code></pre></div>
<p>I don't really have insight in what it would take to implement support for components. But I figured it would be desirable - and I didn't see it being tracked already, so I figured we should. Folks with more knowledge about the challenges here should probably chime in though.<br>
