<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5240">PR #5240</a> from <code>shared-bit-safer</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit is an attempt at improving the safety of using the return value of the <code>SharedMemory::data</code> method. Previously this returned <code>*mut [u8]</code> which, while correct, is unwieldy and unsafe to work with. The new return value of <code>&amp;[UnsafeCell&lt;u8&gt;]</code> has a few advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The lifetime of the returned data is now connected to the <code>SharedMemory</code> itself, removing the possibility for a class of errors of accidentally using the prior <code>*mut [u8]</code> beyond its original lifetime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's not possibly to safely access <code>.len()</code> as opposed to requiring an <code>unsafe</code> dereference before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data internally within the slice is now what retains the <code>unsafe</code> bits, namely indicating that accessing any memory inside of the contents returned is <code>unsafe</code> but addressing it is safe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was inspired by the <code>wiggle</code>-based discussion on #5229 and felt it appropriate to apply a similar change here.</p>
