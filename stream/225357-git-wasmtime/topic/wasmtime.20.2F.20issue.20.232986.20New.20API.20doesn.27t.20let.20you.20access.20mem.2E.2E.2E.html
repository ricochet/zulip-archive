<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the report, and this is a good question! I think you cover the problem pretty well here and have a pretty good grasp on what the limitations are. I agree that there's no great way (even with workarounds) to do this today. I personally would think that the best fix would be to implement <code>AsContext</code> and <code>AsContextMut</code> for the returned futures. That would indeed be significantly difficult for us on an implementation side but that's not necessarily a deterrent per-se.</p>
<p>I think that the only workaround possible for now is the <code>Rc&lt;...&gt;</code>-based solution where the <code>Store</code> contains a channel through which communication can be done with the original call-site. The future closes over the <code>StoreContext&lt;'_, T&gt;</code> which means you can't get access to <code>T</code> while the future is running, so that sort of side-channel is the only method.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>The actual code is a bit more complicated than that (I'm also sharing a struct between the host functions and the caller), but I'm basically using <code>call_async</code> in order to start execution, manually polling the future returned by <code>call_async</code>, and while the execution is paused I can read/write the memory of the Wasm VM.</p>
<p>I've been trying to upgrade to <code>wasmtime 0.28</code>, but <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/11">the new API</a> is giving me a lot of trouble.<br>
Calling <code>call_async</code> now requires passing an <code>impl AsMutContext</code> that is being held for the entire duration of the call, meaning that we lose the ability to read/write memory from outside the host functions while the asynchronous call is in progress.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could give me suggestions on how to upgrade <span aria-label="pray" class="emoji emoji-1f64f" role="img" title="pray">:pray:</span> </p>
<h2>What I've tried</h2>
<p>My little snippet maybe implies that the Wasm memory is used as a vector of communication between the host functions and the "outside", and that this could be refactored. But in practice the fact that I can read/write the memory of the Wasm function while execution is paused is something deeply ingrained in the API of my code (as this seems like a sensible thing to do), and tens of thousands of lines of code depend on the ability to do that.</p>
<p>I've been trying to think of a way to pass to <code>call_async</code> some sort of glorified <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Store&gt;&gt;</code> that would implement <code>AsMutContext</code>, but I believe that the way the trait is defined makes it impossible to do in a safe way.</p>
<p>There is a way to implement this safely:<br>
The <code>Caller&lt;_&gt;</code> that is accessible by the host functions can be used to read and write memory, so in principle one could imagine a system where an <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;Operation&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is shared between the "outside" and the host functions, where <code>Operation</code> is some sort of <code>enum { ReadMemory(_), WriteMemory(_) }</code> and host functions process these operations after each <code>await</code>.<br>
However this seems like a lot of complication.</p>
<p>One potential change in <code>wasmtime</code> that could make sense to me would be to implement <code>AsContext</code> and <code>AsContextMut</code> on the future returned by <code>call_async</code>. In practice, however, this seems almost impossible to implement.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!<br>

<p>I've posted some initial work for this at <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2999">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2999</a>, but I think that manually implementing futures for <code>Instance::new_async</code> and friends is not really feasible to do. That means that only <code>call_async</code> gives access to the underlying context for now, so I'm not sure if it's the best to merge.</p>
