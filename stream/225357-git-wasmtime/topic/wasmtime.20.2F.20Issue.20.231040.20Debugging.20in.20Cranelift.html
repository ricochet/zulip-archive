<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For other wasm-using users of Cranelift, that requires depending on wasmtime-debug and wasmtime-environ. Is that the way to go? </p>
<p>For non-wasm users of Cranelift,  I don't think the wasmtime-debug machinery applies so much</p>
<p>At the very least, I'd like to at least look into upstreaming the DWARF translation into cranelift-wasm </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier, we were trying to decide if the "debug" crate shall be in cranelift or wasmtime project, and norrowed a scope to the wasmtime only. Since it is a single repository now, we have a choice to generalize wasmtime-debug crate and make it available for non-wasm users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it specifically references VMContext</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wasmtime-debug crate is using cranelift data to generate DWARF sections. The VMContext is coming into play only for DWARF expression and can be changed to use some other Instance/State/Context abstraction or none.</p>
<p>@iximeow FWIW, as stated, the original issue is vague and it turned into set of ideas without a acceptable plan. It is correct that the existing solution provides a way to debug cratelift generated code for wasm users due to the wasmtime location. Let's file a separate issues for the deficiencies of the current implementation. Or is it preferable to keep this issue opened for that?</p>
