<p>alexcrichton labeled <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4025">issue #4025</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently whenever a module is instantiated within a store for the first time it will register itself within the global map of all modules so the signal handlers have a way to go from a faulting address to determine whether it's a wasm pc that should have faulted. This operation, however, is quite costly relative to many other things wasmtime does, especially because pthread rwlocks aren't necessarily known for their speed.</p>
<p>Instead we should probably skip this lock altogether. Instead we should probably perform the global registration task when a <code>Module</code> is created rather than when a <code>Module</code> is instantiated for the first time within a store. This will remove both the rwlock used when a module is instantiated as well as when a store is dropped and the module is unregistered in the global map.</p>
