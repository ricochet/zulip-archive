<p>I'd like to use this issue as a tracking issue for filling out gaps in <code>wasmtime</code>'s introductory documentation. This includes <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/master/docs">our book</a> (<a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/">rendered</a>), API documentation (<a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/">rendered</a>), and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/master/crates/api/examples">examples</a>. (or anything else others can think of as well!)</p>
<p>Below I'm gonna fill out a bunch of checkmarks and checkboxes for what is currently missing <em>at this time</em>. If you'd like to help in and document things, please feel free to do so! If you leave a comment on this issue along with what you'd like to help fill in, we'll edit your name into the description here to know that it's claimed. Any and all help here is greatly appreciated!</p>
<h2>Book Documentation</h2>
<p>As a precursor I'll say that this is organized largely page-by-page in the book. The current organization of the book was an initial proposal from awhile ago and thinking back on it some of it may be a little redundant. Please feel free to also discuss the layout of the book and what documentation would best go where!</p>

<h2>API Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/">crate documentation</a> feels lacking and could use a broad example to introduce the crate.</li>
<li>[x] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Module.html"><code>Module</code> type</a> should have at least one example somewhere.</li>
<li>[ ] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Instance.html"><code>Instance</code> type</a> should have at least one example.</li>
<li>[ ] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Store.html"><code>Store</code> type</a> needs more documentation about what it is, although this is somewhat up for debate in other issues as well.</li>
<li>[x] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html"><code>Memory</code> type</a> needs examples of safe usage, and double-checks on wording about unsafe usage.</li>
<li>[ ] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Func.html"><code>Func</code> type</a> could use an example on the <code>get</code> family of methods.</li>
<li>[ ] Types which correspond to the <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/index.html">wasm specification</a> should link there where possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>I think we want an overhaul of how our examples work. Here's my proposal for what we need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Move Rust examples to a top-level <code>examples</code> directory - @alexcrichton </li>
<li>[x] Move C examples to the top-level <code>examples</code> directory too - @alexcrichton </li>
<li>[x] Every example has a comment at the top of the file of how to build and run it - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>Rust is typically <code>cargo run --example foo</code></li>
<li>C is <code>gcc examples/foo.c -I crates/c-api/include -o foo &amp;&amp; ./foo</code> (ish)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Wasm files are never checked in for examples - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>Either wasm is written inline as a <code>*.wat</code> string</li>
<li>Or example is structured as <code>examples/name/main.rs</code> with a corresponding <code>examples/name/wasm/Cargo.toml</code> which is a Rust project compiled to wasm. (or <code>examples/name/wasm.c</code> if we want to show off a C-compiled wasm example)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Every example is available in both Rust and C - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>For <code>examples/foo.rs</code> we have a corresponding <code>examples/foo.c</code></li>
<li>For <code>examples/foo/main.rs</code> we have a corresponding <code>examples/foo/main.c</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Example showing how to link in the WASI functions</li>
<li>[ ] Example of reading a string from a wasm module </li>
<li>[ ] Example of a string processor, for example a markdown renderer</li>
<li>[x] All examples are compiled and run on CI, regardless of language, on our three main platforms. - @alexcrichton <br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd like to use this issue as a tracking issue for filling out gaps in <code>wasmtime</code>'s introductory documentation.

<h2>Book Documentation</h2>
<p>As a precursor I'll say that this is organized largely page-by-page in the book.

<h2>API Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/">crate documentation</a> feels lacking and could use a broad example to introduce the crate.</li>
<li>[x] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Module.html"><code>Module</code> type</a> should have at least one example somewhere.</li>

<li>[ ] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Store.html"><code>Store</code> type</a> needs more documentation about what it is, although this is somewhat up for debate in other issues as well.</li>
<li>[x] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html"><code>Memory</code> type</a> needs examples of safe usage, and double-checks on wording about unsafe usage.</li>
<li>[ ] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Func.html"><code>Func</code> type</a> could use an example on the <code>get</code> family of methods.</li>
<li>[ ] Types which correspond to the <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/index.html">wasm specification</a> should link there where possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>I think we want an overhaul of how our examples work. Here's my proposal for what we need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Move Rust examples to a top-level <code>examples</code> directory - @alexcrichton </li>
<li>[x] Move C examples to the top-level <code>examples</code> directory too - @alexcrichton </li>
<li>[x] Every example has a comment at the top of the file of how to build and run it - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>Rust is typically <code>cargo run --example foo</code></li>
<li>C is <code>gcc examples/foo.c -I crates/c-api/include -o foo &amp;&amp; ./foo</code> (ish)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Wasm files are never checked in for examples - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>Either wasm is written inline as a <code>*.wat</code> string</li>
<li>Or example is structured as <code>examples/name/main.rs</code> with a corresponding <code>examples/name/wasm/Cargo.toml</code> which is a Rust project compiled to wasm. (or <code>examples/name/wasm.c</code> if we want to show off a C-compiled wasm example)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Every example is available in both Rust and C - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>For <code>examples/foo.rs</code> we have a corresponding <code>examples/foo.c</code></li>

<p>I'd like to use this issue as a tracking issue for filling out gaps in <code>wasmtime</code>'s introductory documentation. This includes <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/master/docs">our book</a> (<a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/">rendered</a>), API documentation (<a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/">rendered</a>), and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/master/crates/api/examples">examples</a>.

<p>Below I'm gonna fill out a bunch of checkmarks and checkboxes for what is currently missing <em>at this time</em>. If you'd like to help in and document things, please feel free to do so! If you leave a comment on this issue along with what you'd like to help fill in, we'll edit your name into the description here to know that it's claimed.

<h2>Book Documentation</h2>
<p>As a precursor I'll say that this is organized largely page-by-page in the book. The current organization of the book was an initial proposal from awhile ago and thinking back on it some of it may be a little redundant.

<h2>API Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/">crate documentation</a> feels lacking and could use a broad example to introduce the crate.</li>
<li>[x] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Module.html"><code>Module</code> type</a> should have at least one example somewhere.</li>

<li>[ ] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Store.html"><code>Store</code> type</a> needs more documentation about what it is, although this is somewhat up for debate in other issues as well.</li>
<li>[x] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html"><code>Memory</code> type</a> needs examples of safe usage, and double-checks on wording about unsafe usage.</li>
<li>[ ] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Func.html"><code>Func</code> type</a> could use an example on the <code>get</code> family of methods.</li>
<li>[ ] Types which correspond to the <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/index.html">wasm specification</a> should link there where possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>I think we want an overhaul of how our examples work. Here's my proposal for what we need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Move Rust examples to a top-level <code>examples</code> directory - @alexcrichton </li>
<li>[x] Move C examples to the top-level <code>examples</code> directory too - @alexcrichton </li>
<li>[x] Every example has a comment at the top of the file of how to build and run it - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>Rust is typically <code>cargo run --example foo</code></li>
<li>C is <code>gcc examples/foo.c -I crates/c-api/include -o foo &amp;&amp; ./foo</code> (ish)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Wasm files are never checked in for examples - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>Either wasm is written inline as a <code>*.wat</code> string</li>
<li>Or example is structured as <code>examples/name/main.rs</code> with a corresponding <code>examples/name/wasm/Cargo.toml</code> which is a Rust project compiled to wasm. (or <code>examples/name/wasm.c</code> if we want to show off a C-compiled wasm example)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Every example is available in both Rust and C - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>For <code>examples/foo.rs</code> we have a corresponding <code>examples/foo.c</code></li>
<li>For <code>examples/foo/main.rs</code> we have a corresponding <code>examples/foo/main.c</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Example showing how to link in the WASI functions</li>
<li>[ ] Example of reading a string from a wasm module </li>
<li>[ ] Example of a string processor, for example a markdown renderer</li>
<li>[x] All examples are compiled and run on CI, regardless of language, on our three main platforms. - @alexcrichton <br>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>I think we want an overhaul of how our examples work. Here's my proposal for what we need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Move Rust examples to a top-level <code>examples</code> directory - @alexcrichton </li>
<li>[x] Move C examples to the top-level <code>examples</code> directory too - @alexcrichton </li>
<li>[x] Every example has a comment at the top of the file of how to build and run it - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>Rust is typically <code>cargo run --example foo</code></li>
<li>C is <code>gcc examples/foo.c -I crates/c-api/include -o foo &amp;&amp; ./foo</code> (ish)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Wasm files are never checked in for examples - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>Either wasm is written inline as a <code>*.wat</code> string</li>
<li>Or example is structured as <code>examples/name/main.rs</code> with a corresponding <code>examples/name/wasm/Cargo.toml</code> which is a Rust project compiled to wasm. (or <code>examples/name/wasm.c</code> if we want to show off a C-compiled wasm example)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Every example is available in both Rust and C - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>For <code>examples/foo.rs</code> we have a corresponding <code>examples/foo.c</code></li>
<li>For <code>examples/foo/main.rs</code> we have a corresponding <code>examples/foo/main.c</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Example showing how to link in the WASI functions</li>
<li>[ ] Example of reading a string from a wasm module </li>
<li>[ ] Example of a string processor, for example a markdown renderer</li>
<li>[x] All examples are compiled and run on CI, regardless of language, on our three main platforms. - @alexcrichton <br>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Rust is typically <code>cargo run --example foo</code></li>
<li>C is <code>gcc examples/foo.c -I crates/c-api/include -o foo &amp;&amp; ./foo</code> (ish)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Wasm files are never checked in for examples - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>Either wasm is written inline as a <code>*.wat</code> string</li>
<li>Or example is structured as <code>examples/name/main.rs</code> with a corresponding <code>examples/name/wasm/Cargo.toml</code> which is a Rust project compiled to wasm. (or <code>examples/name/wasm.c</code> if we want to show off a C-compiled wasm example)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Every example is available in both Rust and C - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>For <code>examples/foo.rs</code> we have a corresponding <code>examples/foo.c</code></li>
<li>For <code>examples/foo/main.rs</code> we have a corresponding <code>examples/foo/main.c</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Example showing how to link in the WASI functions</li>
<li>[ ] Example of reading a string from a wasm module </li>
<li>[ ] Example of a string processor, for example a markdown renderer</li>
<li>[x] All examples are compiled and run on CI, regardless of language, on our three main platforms. - @alexcrichton <br>

<h2>API Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>[x] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/">crate documentation</a> feels lacking and could use a broad example to introduce the crate.</li>
<li>[x] The <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/struct.Module.html"><code>Module</code> type</a> should have at least one example somewhere.</li>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>I think we want an overhaul of how our examples work. Here's my proposal for what we need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Move Rust examples to a top-level <code>examples</code> directory - @alexcrichton </li>
<li>[x] Move C examples to the top-level <code>examples</code> directory too - @alexcrichton </li>
<li>[x] Every example has a comment at the top of the file of how to build and run it - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>Rust is typically <code>cargo run --example foo</code></li>
<li>C is <code>gcc examples/foo.c -I crates/c-api/include -o foo &amp;&amp; ./foo</code> (ish)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Wasm files are never checked in for examples - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>Either wasm is written inline as a <code>*.wat</code> string</li>
<li>Or example is structured as <code>examples/name/main.rs</code> with a corresponding <code>examples/name/wasm/Cargo.toml</code> which is a Rust project compiled to wasm. (or <code>examples/name/wasm.c</code> if we want to show off a C-compiled wasm example)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Every example is available in both Rust and C - @alexcrichton <ul>
<li>For <code>examples/foo.rs</code> we have a corresponding <code>examples/foo.c</code></li>
<li>For <code>examples/foo/main.rs</code> we have a corresponding <code>examples/foo/main.c</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Example showing how to link in the WASI functions</li>
<li>[ ] Example of reading a string from a wasm module </li>
<li>[ ] Example of a string processor, for example a markdown renderer</li>
<li>[x] All examples are compiled and run on CI, regardless of language, on our three main platforms. - @alexcrichton <br>

<p>Ah thanks for the ping but I think that this is largely done now and this is pretty old now so I'm going to go ahead and close this.</p>

<p>I'd like to use this issue as a tracking issue for filling out gaps in <code>wasmtime</code>'s introductory documentation. This includes <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/master/docs">our book</a> (<a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/">rendered</a>), API documentation (<a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/api/wasmtime/">rendered</a>), and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/master/crates/api/examples">examples</a>. (or anything else others can think of as well!)</p>
<p>Below I'm gonna fill out a bunch of checkmarks and checkboxes for what is currently missing <em>at this time</em>. If you'd like to help in and document things, please feel free to do so! If you leave a comment on this issue along with what you'd like to help fill in, we'll edit your name into the description here to know that it's claimed. Any and all help here is greatly appreciated!</p>
<h2>Book Documentation</h2>
<p>As a precursor I'll say that this is organized largely page-by-page in the book. The current organization of the book was an initial proposal from awhile ago and thinking back on it some of it may be a little redundant. Please feel free to also discuss the layout of the book and what documentation would best go where!</p>

<li>[ ] <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/examples.html">List of example programs compiled to WebAssembly</a>.
