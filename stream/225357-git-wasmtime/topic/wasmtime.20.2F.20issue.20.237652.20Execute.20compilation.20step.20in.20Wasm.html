<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for working forward on this, and it's great to see something already up and running!</p>
<p>I've skimmed over the changes you've made and they're all looking reasonable to me. I'd personally prefer though to have a different trajectory for integrating a change like this in the sense that I already feel like we have too many internal crates and I'd prefer to move towards consolidating them instead of proliferating them. In that sense I'd prefer to not add new <code>wasmtime-jit-runtime</code> or <code>wasmtime-compile</code> crates but instead control this all through Cargo features of the <code>wasmtime</code> crate if possible. </p>
<p>Cargo features provides a good way in my mind to think about this and continue development of it into the future. It means that the Wasmtime CLI, for example, could be itself compiled to WebAssembly so long as everything except the <code>compile</code> command were disabled. The output of <code>compile</code> would be usable by Wasmtime of the same version though. Reducing the number of crates additionally helps keep things a bit more maintainable internally I think since there's less of a question of what-goes-where.</p>
<p>Organizationally what I'd recommend is to move all target-agnostic things, such as <code>wasmtime_jit::ObjectBuilder</code>, into <code>wasmtime-environ</code>. The <code>wasmtime-environ</code> crate already actually compiles to WebAssembly and is used by jco. In that sense the <code>wasmtime-environ</code> crate is a suitable location for "stuff things here that compile everywhere and have no system dependencies". I think that the <code>wasmtime-compile</code> and <code>wasmtime-jit-runtime</code> crates could probably be merged into <code>wasmtime-environ</code>. One day I'd like to merge the <code>{wasmtime-runtime, wasmtime-jit, wasmtime}</code> crates if possible since I don't think we're getting much mileage from the distinction right now.</p>
<hr>
<p>I've also been wondering a bit about the threading issue you mention since I think that's important to solve. One initial way I was thinking it might be solved was explicit threading on the host, for example no shared state and a <code>Store</code>-per-thread where the embedder orchestrates the threads and calls cranelift once-per-function. Wiring this all up I don't think is that feasible though since it would be exposing a lot of internals of Wasmtime which wouldn't be great.</p>
<p>Alternatively though one option would be the <code>wasm32-wasi-threads</code> target. While I haven't tested it myself I think that the <code>rayon</code> crate should work there so in theory <code>wasmtime run -S threads wasmtime.wasm compile ...</code> should "just work" and have internal parallelism. That would then also work from an embedder point of view assuming you wouldn't use the literal CLI itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regarding merging the crates and using features, what would you think about the following steps?:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move everything target agnostic from <code>wasmtime-jit</code> to <code>wasmtime-environ</code>.</li>
<li>Move the remaining parts of <code>wasmtime-jit</code> into <code>wasmtime</code> and remove <code>wasmtime-jit</code>.</li>
<li>Put everything target specific in <code>wasmtime</code> under a feature, such that we can compile it to <code>wasm32</code> if that feature isn't enabled.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not sure how messy step 3 would end up being. Maybe it would be easier to move the parts of <code>wasmtime</code> required for compilation from <code>wasmtime</code> to <code>wasmtime-environ</code> instead of 3?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Step 1/2 sound good to me.</p>
<p>For step 3 I agree things may get a bit messy. One possibility though is we could have:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crates/wasmtime/src/runtime/*.rs</code> - all runtime bits, only one cfg to turn off the entire things</li>
<li><code>crates/wasmtime/src/compile/*.rs</code> - all compiling bits, only one cfg to turn off as well</li>
</ul>
<p>The final crate structure of types like <code>wasmtime::Instance</code> would be the same but everything would be defined under <code>crates/wasmtime/src/runtime/store.rs</code> for example. I'd personally prefer to slurp things into the <code>wasmtime</code> crate rather than the other way around, but not at the cost of large contortions so if you find it's too difficult to go that direction I think it's reasonable to move agnostic things into <code>wasmtime-environ</code>.</p>
