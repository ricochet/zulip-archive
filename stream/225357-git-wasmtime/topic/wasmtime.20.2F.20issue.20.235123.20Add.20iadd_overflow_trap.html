<p>It looks correct, but I'd prefer if it implemented support for all variants of the ADD LOGICAL instruction (i.e. including the memory-and-register and the 32-&gt;64 zero-extended operand versions).  In particular, I'm assuming the original <code>iadd_ifcout</code> will go away at some point, and then this will be the only operation that can trigger emission of those instructions.</p>
<p>(The duplication is a bit annoying.  Maybe it would be nicer to have a common <code>add_logical</code> helper that could be used both by <code>iadd_overflow_trap</code> -adding the trap- and by <code>iadd_ifcout</code> -ignoring the flags- ?  On the other hand, if <code>ifadd_ifcout</code> goes away soon, that probably doesn't matter?    Either way, that shouldn't delay merging this PR; I can fix it up afterwards.)</p>
<p>As an independent question, I'm wondering about naming: this is about overflow of <em>unsigned</em> addition, so maybe it should be called <code>uadd_overflow_trap</code> in case we may want to add an <code>sadd_overflow_trap</code> at some point?<br>

<p>Happy to add in the additional variants, I'll try factoring out a helper as you suggest. My plan is to remove <code>iadd_ifcout</code> and the other instructions that use iflags as soon as this PR is merged, as the legalization of <code>heap_addr</code> will no longer rely on them. Once the PR that removes <code>iadd_ifcout</code> and friends is up, we can revisit the duplication.</p>

<p>I'd be happy to rename this <code>uadd_overflow_trap</code> instead. I chose this name to mirror the existing name of <code>iadd_ifcout</code>, but would be happy to pick something that conveys the behavior better.</p>

<p>I understand the <code>cout</code> in the existing name stands for "carry out", where the use of "carry" instead of "overflow" is supposed to denote that we're preforming the unsigned operation.   I guess we could also use <code>iadd_carry_trap</code> vs. <code>iadd_overflow_trap</code>, but mirroring the existing <code>uadd_...</code> vs. <code>sadd_...</code> scheme looks clearer to me.</p>
<p>(Also, as we're already bikeshedding on the name, all the other trap operations have the condition <em>after</em> the word "trap", e.g. <code>trapz</code> for trap-if-zero.  So maybe it should actually be <code>uadd_trap_overflow</code> for unsigned-add-and-trap-if-overflow?)<br>

<p>I believe the current ISLE logic doesn't really allow folding an instruction with two outputs (like <code>iadd_cout</code>), so I don't think this would be possible.</p>
<p>However, either way, I think it's a good point: we should also make a decision on the other "carry" type instructions (<code>iadd_cin</code>, <code>iadd_cout</code>, <code>iadd_carry</code>).  Right now those are defined, but not implemented on any target.  I think they should either <em>be</em> implemented, or else removed.<br>

<p>The Rust standard library provides routines like <code>overflowing_add</code> and (still unstable) <code>carrying_add</code>, whose semantics map onto those instructions:<br>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html#method.overflowing_add">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html#method.overflowing_add</a><br>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html#method.carrying_add">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html#method.carrying_add</a></p>
<p>While I believe at the moment they're not actually implemented using those clif instructions at the moment, I guess the compiler could be improved to do so at some point.  All in all, it's probably best to keep the clif instructions, since there's no real other way to expose those particular instructions (which many ISAs do have).<br>

<p>Agreed.   I prefer "unsigned overflow / signed overflow"  over  "carry / overflow" since the former is simply more explicit ...<br>
