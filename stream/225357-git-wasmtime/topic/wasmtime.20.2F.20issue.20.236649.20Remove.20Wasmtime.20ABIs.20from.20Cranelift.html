<blockquote>
<p>cc @uweigand if you're up for it I could use some help on the s390x-side of things. I believe that the Wasmtime ABI was load-bearing in a way not related to multi-value on the s390x backend to handle lane order of vector types, meaning that I think as-is this an't land since it'll fail tests on s390x. I was wondering if you had thoughts or ideas about how to go about fixing this? In my mind the fix would look something along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Somehow get all wasm funtions to think they're using little-endian lane ordering. Previously this was done with the <code>Wasmtime*</code> family of calling conventions but I'd ideally like to remove this Wasmtime "brand" from Cranelift to avoid all backends having to deal with it.</li>
<li>Converting between big and little-endian lane orders in the various trampolines as necessary. This may not actually be required since v128 is never passed in registers via <code>TypedFunc</code> (haven't gotten around to implementing that in Wasmtime), so this point may already be "solved". In the future though I think it'd be fine to "just" generate more code in trampolines.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I guess the question boils down to: should an ABI be added for s390x to specify that the lane order of vectors is little-endian? Or are there other options you can think of to solve this?</p>

<p>I think this will be easier once we switch all internal Wasm functions to using the <code>tail</code> calling convention, and then the <code>tail</code> calling convention can specify a little-endian lane ordering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah the more I think about this the more I realize it's probably best to leave things as-is and tied to the calling convention for now. I think it'd be good nonetheless to get stuff in ahead of time before <code>tail</code> if possible so I've left <code>WasmtimeSystemV</code> for now for s390x but left all the other changes so multi-return is not different in the calling convention and instead multi-return is handled differently in the native ABI.</p>

<p>Hurray looks like tests are green on s390x! I think this is good to go and we can tackle how to avoid having a specific ABI for s390x, if at all, in the future.</p>
