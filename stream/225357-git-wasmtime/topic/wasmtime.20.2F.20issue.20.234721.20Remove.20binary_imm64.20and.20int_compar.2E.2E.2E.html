<p>Hah, I guess I accidentally implemented what @cfallin proposed just by being confused. Thanks for digging that link up! It's helpful context.</p>
<p>I noticed a couple things that I think are existing bugs while exploring this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The backends all panic if they see these opcodes during lowering... Except that x64 has rules in <code>lower.isle</code> to match <code>iadd_imm</code>. Can those rules ever fire?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see <code>simple_preopt</code> was intended to rewrite "(iadd (iconst x) (iadd (iconst y) z))" to fold the constants together, and it uses the <code>*_imm</code> opcodes as an intermediate step. But it looks like that only actually happens if the constant is the first operand, not the second, because only one case has a recursive call to <code>simplify</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Independent of whether we keep the <code>*_imm</code> instructions, I'm also wondering: Can <code>simple_preopt</code> be replaced with ISLE and match on the full tree structure, instead of rewriting to this intermediate form to avoid having to look three layers down in the tree of operators? I wonder if it would reduce compile time by not modifying instructions that it can't actually improve. Is that something that should happen after the e-graph work lands?</p>

<p>Wow, there is a lot more stuff attached to <code>_imm</code> than i expected!</p>
<p>Is it possible to print a comment with the const value if one of the sides of the <code>iadd</code>/<code>isub</code>/etc.. is a const? That way we could recover some of the readability.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">v0</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">iconst</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kt">i16</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">0xABCD</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">v1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">..</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">v2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">..</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>It would also help in cases other than <code>*_imm</code>. But probably does not cover all cases.</p>

<p>@jameysharp thanks for exploring here. As others have pointed out, there's a lot of prior thought on this, and overall I think we do want to remove these variants in due time.</p>

<p>Currently the legalizer rewrites them from <code>_imm</code> form to op-with-iconst before the lowering backends see the CLIF; this is why we don't need to handle them in each backend.</p>

<p>Indeed, that's one of the main effects of my mid-end optimizer work; it will replace <code>simple_preopt</code> just as you are suggesting.</p>
<p>Now, regarding <code>iadd</code> vs <code>iadd_imm</code> and friends:</p>
<p>I think that breaking the ops into smaller pieces, and keeping <code>iadd</code> separate from its <code>imm</code>, makes the most sense from an optimization-rules perspective: we otherwise need rules to match both. (For example, multiply-add needs to also match multiply-add-imm.) Likewise it's useful to keep <code>iconst</code> separate because we want to do special things with it sometimes, like rematerialization and/or use of constant pools.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the original <code>_imm</code> forms, aside from the code-size advantage that @sunfishcode mentions in #3250, was that old Cranelift rewrote CLIF until each op had a direct machine-instruction equivalent; so <code>iadd_imm</code> was useful to represent the reg-immediate form of the x86 add instruction. We no longer have that constraint, though.</p>
<p>So I think the right way forward is in spirit similar to what you've done here, but (i) do it after the mid-end optimizer lands (pending RFC approval!) because there are some immediate followup thoughts in how to make legalization ride on top of it; and (ii) generate the <code>_imm</code> helpers on the <code>InstBuilder</code> in a programmatic way, rather than manually writing them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Basically, generating the code is less error-prone and allows us to extend the pattern to arbitrary instructions as we choose fit; it's a lower-entropy encoding of the system design. We already generate <code>.iadd()</code> so generating <code>.iadd_imm()</code> given a special flag isn't a huge stretch. In contrast, mixing generated code and handwritten code (this PR) feels asymmetric and is difficult to maintain and extend in the future.</p>

<p>Right. So <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/fbfceaec9821deec2d18587505f7efce2b0a42db/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/lower.isle#L192-L221">these rules in x64's lower.isle</a> can never match, yeah?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently so! We can go ahead and delete those; I suspect fuzz coverage, if we were to get it in terms of ISLE source, would show this as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great, I've opened #4726 for deleting those.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, generating the code is less error-prone and allows us to extend the pattern to arbitrary instructions as we choose fit; it's a lower-entropy encoding of the system design. We already generate <code>.iadd()</code> so generating <code>.iadd_imm()</code> given a special flag isn't a huge stretch. In contrast, mixing generated code and handwritten code (this PR) feels asymmetric and is difficult to maintain and extend in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, I can see that. It's not obvious to me what code that should generate, though, because the current <code>InstBuilder</code> traits assume each method will build exactly one instruction, consuming the builder. These <code>_imm</code> variants, being a kind of macro for multiple instructions, are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>But we can sort that out when it's time to re-visit this after your e-graph work lands.</p>
