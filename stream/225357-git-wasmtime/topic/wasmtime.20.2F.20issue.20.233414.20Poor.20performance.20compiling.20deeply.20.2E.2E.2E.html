<blockquote>
<p>This was found recently via a fuzz-generated test case, but it appears that Wasmtime has relatively poor performance compiling functions that have deeply nested blocks with little actual branching in them.</p>
<p>This wasm file: <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/files/7280553/bar.wasm.gz">bar.wasm.gz</a> currently takes ~10ms to compile:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">time</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">target</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">release</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">wasmtime</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">compile</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">--</span><span class="n">disable</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">cache</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">wasm</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>Execution with fuzzing is 20-30x slower than normal execution, and the original file that this came from had ~100 copies of this function. Fuzzing also disables parallel compilation, which means that it's a 2000-3000x slowdown from the measurement here, which accounts for the roughly 30s the original module takes to compile with fuzzing enabled, leading to the timeout.</p>
<p>This is probably a case that will be helped by the new register allocator (eventually), but I suspect there's a lot of low-hanging fruit for improving this codegen as well.</p>
