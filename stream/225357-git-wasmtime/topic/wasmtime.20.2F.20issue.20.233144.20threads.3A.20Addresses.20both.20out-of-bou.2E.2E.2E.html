<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3144">issue #3144</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the threads proposal atomic operations can be invalid with their addresses for two reasons: either they're out-of-bounds or they're misaligned. I'm not sure what the intention is in the official spec which of these traps should happen if both are true.</p>
<p>Currently the implementation of threads (after #3143) will sort of "nondeterministically" reveal either trap. The exact trap depends on the configuration of the runtime. The problem is that the <code>heap_addr</code> in cranelift doesn't actually verify the address, it just ensures that if it's accessed it's either guaranteed to segfault or it's guaranteed to be valid. In the "guaranteed to be valid" case we'd give an out-of-bounds trap, whereas in the "guaranteed to segfault" case we'd give a misalignment trap because the alignment check happens before the actual memory access.</p>
<p>We should probably clarify with the upstream specification which trap is intended, and we'll need to modify codegen to match this. My guess is that we'll want to guarantee that the misalignment trap happens first, and only properly aligned addresses are reported as out-of-bounds. That should allow us to have a boolean flag on the <code>heap_addr</code> clif instruction to check for alignment, and it'd add the two operands as the first thing to check the alignment, and then the overflow check afterwards tests whether the addition was correct.</p>

<p>Hm no nevermind I'm just gonna fix this to be alignment is checked first and then out-of-bounds.</p>
