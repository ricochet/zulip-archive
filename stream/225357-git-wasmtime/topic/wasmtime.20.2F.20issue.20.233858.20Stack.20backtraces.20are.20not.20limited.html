<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3858">issue #3858</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discovered while debugging CI windows failures last Friday, one thing we noticed was that backtraces are, by default, not limited in Wasmtime meaning they'll capture all relevant frames. This exposed a bug in Cranelift that the unwinding information may not be correct, but at the same time it's probably not desirable to have possibly-infinitely-long stack traces in Wasmtime. Instead we should probably limit the number of frames captured in a stack trace, probably to something reasonable-ish like 100, especially since stack depth can be controlled by the guest as well.</p>
