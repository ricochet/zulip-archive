<blockquote>
<p>I'm assuming the question arises in the context of the new backend.</p>
<p>From looking at LLVM's docs, it seems that <code>alloca</code> always takes a static (= known at compile time) amount of stack space. If that's true, it should be somewhat easy to implement (add amount to SP, adjust the "nominal SP" offset, make sure to deallocate in the return paths).</p>
<p>If one can pass a dynamic input value that's the amount to allocate, it is likely to be much trickier, because we need to be able to track precisely the running SP value within the function's body: that's what the nominal SP offset does in a static manner. It should be implementable, but it might require using a register for this purpose.</p>

<p>No, it also allows a dynamic input. It is just that a static input is equivalent to using stack slots in Cranelift.</p>

<p>It's definitely possible to implement this with the new backends. It interacts with the way we address stack slots and spill slots; at least on aarch64, we address function arguments with <code>fp</code>, which stays at the top of the stack frame (invariant to any <code>alloca</code>s), but we address stack/spill slots with offsets from <code>sp</code>, because positive offsets are cheaper on aarch64. We track "nominal SP" as an offset from real SP, so we can continue to access this storage while we've temporarily pushed args to set up for a call.</p>
<p>The most straightforward approach would probably be to (i) detect when an alloca (or just a dynamic alloca) is present; then if so, (ii) allocate a separate scratch register in the prologue and copy nominal-SP to that; then (iii) access all stack and spill slots relative to that register. We lose a register in that case but I think that's unavoidable unless we revert to negative offsets from FP (which has a higher cost -- a few percent degradation at least, because it forces <code>add</code> instructions to synthesize addresses when offset more than -<code>0x80</code>, IIRC).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This should be an option in my opinion. Using DWARF unwinding for perf profiles as opposed to frame pointers results in much bigger <code>perf.data</code> files and slower <code>perf report</code>, as it requires capturing a big chunk of the stack and then performing the unwinding offline. Online unwinding using DWARF tables is simply too slow.</p>

<p>Definitely, but I think omitting a traditional frame pointer should be default for these ABIs, at least for optimized compilations.  An option to opt-in when they are legitimately needed (like in the case of a tool relying on them for fast stack walks) makes sense to me.</p>
