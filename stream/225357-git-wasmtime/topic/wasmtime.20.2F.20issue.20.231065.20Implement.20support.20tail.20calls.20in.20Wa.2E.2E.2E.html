<blockquote>
<p>To write a functional language compiler using this IR, tail call eliminations would be desirable. Are there any plans to support this? I couldn't find any details in the docs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So @jameysharp and I did a little profiling/investigation of switching the internal Wasm calling convention over to <code>tail</code> on our sightglass benchmarks. I was really expecting this to have no measurable change, but unfortunately it looks like it has a ~7% overhead on bz2 and spidermonkey.wasm and ~1% overhead on pulldown-cmark. This is surprising! We think this means that we ~frequently call functions that don't have enough register pressure to clobber all callee-save registers, and since <code>tail</code> only has caller-save registers and zero callee-save registers, we are doing more spills than we used to. Enough more that it is really measurable.</p>
<p>Supporting caller-save registers with the <code>tail</code> calling convention is possible, but requires more work. Either we do parallel moves (and also avoid building the temporary stack frames for tail calls with stack arguments) or we add a bunch of fiddly offset computation for tail calls. Both possible, but I don't want to do either right this very moment. I'd really like to get a <code>wasmtime::Config</code> knob for Wasm tail calls shipping first.</p>
<p>So here is our updated plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Only use <code>tail</code> as the Wasm internal calling convention when the Wasm tail calls proposal is enabled. This avoids any impact on existing Wasm programs that don't use tail calls. However, it requires a bit of unfortunate plumbing, but that's fine.</li>
<li>[ ] Finish implementing the Wasm tail calls proposal on all platforms and make sure it is fully spec compliant and all that.</li>
<li>[ ] Fix the performance issues after that knob is exposed.</li>
<li>[ ] Switch all Wasm internal calling conventions to <code>tail</code> after that.</li>
<li>[ ] ... profit</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we would not enable tail calls by default in Wasmtime until the performance issues are addressed.</p>
