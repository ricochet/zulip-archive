<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4658">PR #4658</a> from <code>deduplicate-size-align</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit is an effort to reduce the amount of complexity around<br>
managing the size/alignment calculations of types in the canonical ABI.<br>
Previously the logic for the size/alignment of a type was spread out<br>
across a number of locations. While each individual calculation is not<br>
really the most complicated thing in the world having the duplication in<br>
so many places was constantly worrying me.</p>
<p>I've opted in this commit to centralize all of this within the runtime<br>
at least, and now there's only one "duplicate" of this information in<br>
the fuzzing infrastructure which is to some degree less important to<br>
deduplicate. This commit introduces a new <code>CanonicalAbiInfo</code> type to<br>
house all abi size/align information for both memory32 and memory64.<br>
This new type is then used pervasively throughout fused adapter<br>
compilation, dynamic <code>Val</code> management, and typed functions. This type<br>
was also able to reduce the complexity of the macro-generated code<br>
meaning that even <code>wasmtime-component-macro</code> is performing less math<br>
than it was before.</p>
<p>One other major feature of this commit is that this ABI information is<br>
now saved within a <code>ComponentTypes</code> structure. This avoids recursive<br>
querying of size/align information frequently and instead effectively<br>
caching it. This was a worry I had for the fused adapter compiler which<br>
frequently sought out size/align information and would recursively<br>
descend each type tree each time. The <code>fact-valid-module</code> fuzzer is now<br>
nearly 10x faster in terms of iterations/s which I suspect is due to<br>
this caching.</p>
