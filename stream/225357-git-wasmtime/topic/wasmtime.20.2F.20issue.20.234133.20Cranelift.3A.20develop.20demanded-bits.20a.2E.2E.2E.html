<p>In some cases, it is possible to perform better optimizations and instruction selection if one knows that only part of a value is needed (demanded bits). At other times, it is possible to do better if one knows that the operation or instruction actually generating a value sets more bits than are necessary in the destination register (defined-bits).</p>
<p>We should develop these analyses and use them during optimization and during lowering. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitmasks can be simplified or elided when demanded-bits allows: for example, <code>and x, 1</code> with only the LSB demanded is just <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>An extend operator can be elided if the upper (extended-into) bits are not demanded.</li>
<li>An extend operator can be elided if the upper bits are already actually defined by the chosen producer instruction(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>The demanded-bits analysis should be at the CLIF level as it is a machine-independent concept (what bits do the CLIF semantics of the use(s) actually depend on). The defined-bits analysis is fundamentally a lowered-MachInst-level concept, as it has to do (in our case, since no bits within the type are undefined) with bits above a value in a register (e.g., upper 32 for an <code>I32</code> a 64-bit register).</p>

<p>I just realized I've been saying "defined bits" in conversation with you when I meant "known bits". I was about to comment that there is nothing fundamentally register-oriented about it, but of course I was talking about the wrong thing.</p>
<p>For posterity/clarity, _known_ bits is a forwards analysis where we logically keep track of this join semi-lattice per bit in a value:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">?</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">\</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="mi">0</span><span class="w">   </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and we would have transfer functions that do things like</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">    </span><span class="o">????</span><span class="mi">0011</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">bor</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">????????</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="o">------------</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="o">??????</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It's like per-bit (rather than per-value) partial evaluation.</p>
<p>This is totally something we can do at the CLIF level. Nothing here is fundamentally dealing with registers here.</p>
<p>In addition to being useful for peepholes, we can do neat things like remove CFG edges that we know will never be taken (look at the known bits for a <code>br_table</code>'s block index argument and remove edges to the table's blocks that conflict with those known bits). The CFG edge trimming is something that is definitely more of a CLIF thing than a mach inst thing.</p>

<p>That totally makes sense too! Per-bit partial evaluation (or per-bit constant folding I guess) is a good description. A value with all known bits graduates to a full <code>iconst</code> then and can enable further opts.</p>
