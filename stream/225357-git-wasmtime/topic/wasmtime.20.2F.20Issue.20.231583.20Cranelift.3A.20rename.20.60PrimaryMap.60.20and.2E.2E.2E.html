<p>The change could be done incrementally, so as to avoid massive merge conflicts.  First create the new names as (<code>type</code>) aliases of the old ones.  Then we can incrementally move smaller sections of the code base to the new names, and remove the old ones when all sections have been changed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The way we use <code>PrimaryMap</code>, we give it a distinct key type which identifies a conceptual index space. It isn't an arbitrary type that unrelated code might happen to use; it's a "newtype" created for a particular purpose which ensures that you don't accidentally use an index meant for one index space in another.</p>
<p>For example, anywhere in Cranelift you see a <code>Value</code>, it's related to <code>Function</code>'s <code>values</code> <code>PrimaryMap</code>. We don't always make this explicit in variable names, because it's clear from the type. Similarly, anywhere you see a <code>SecondaryMap&lt;Value, Foo&gt;</code>, it's associating a <code>Foo</code> with each value in a function. The auto-resize behavior is almost an implementation detail which we don't currently have a way to fully hide -- we don't want <code>PrimaryMap</code>s to have to maintain lists of associated <code>SecondaryMap</code>s to update when they resize.</p>
<p><code>EntityMap</code> and <code>AttributeMap</code> would also make sense to me.</p>

<p>I like <code>EntityMap</code> and <code>AttributeMap</code> too. I think the original naming may come from the entity-component-system world, where "secondary" data structures hold external information about entities, as Dan describes.</p>
<p>(And a Vector is effectively one way to implement a Map of integer indexes to something, so the Map component in the name seems to make sense here.)</p>
