<p>cfallin opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1852">PR #1852</a> from <code>reftypes</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This PR adds the inital support to allow reftypes to flow through the<br>
program when targetting aarch64. It also adds a fix to the<br>
<code>ModuleTranslationState</code> needed to send R32/R64 types over from the<br>
SpiderMonkey embedding.</p>
<p>This PR does not include any support for safepoints in aarch64 or the<br>
<code>MachInst</code> infrastructure. That work will come as a second PR, following<br>
some needed changes to <a href="http://regalloc.rs">regalloc.rs</a>.</p>
<p>This PR also makes a drive-by improvement to <code>Bint</code>, avoiding an<br>
unneeded zero-extension op when the extended value comes directly from a<br>
conditional-set (which produces a full-width 0 or 1).</p>
<p>With this PR, and a companion patch in SpiderMonkey, we're able to make it<br>
through all of the reftypes tests in the spec testsuite, though we aren't emitting<br>
stackmaps yet so if the GC had been triggered we would have been in trouble.<br>
Still, it's a start!</p>

<p>It's actually <code>cmn</code>, which is a separate instruction. It compares against the twos-complement value of the RHS. We want <code>cmp rn, #-1</code> but <code>-1</code> can't be encoded in an <code>Imm12</code>, so the idiomatic approach on AArch64 is to do <code>cmn rn, #-1</code>.</p>

<p>cfallin updated <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1852">PR #1852</a> from <code>reftypes</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This PR adds the inital support to allow reftypes to flow through the<br>
program when targetting aarch64. It also adds a fix to the<br>
<code>ModuleTranslationState</code> needed to send R32/R64 types over from the<br>
SpiderMonkey embedding.</p>
<p>This PR does not include any support for safepoints in aarch64 or the<br>
<code>MachInst</code> infrastructure. That work will come as a second PR, following<br>
some needed changes to <a href="http://regalloc.rs">regalloc.rs</a>.</p>
<p>This PR also makes a drive-by improvement to <code>Bint</code>, avoiding an<br>
unneeded zero-extension op when the extended value comes directly from a<br>
conditional-set (which produces a full-width 0 or 1).</p>
<p>With this PR, and a companion patch in SpiderMonkey, we're able to make it<br>
through all of the reftypes tests in the spec testsuite, though we aren't emitting<br>
stackmaps yet so if the GC had been triggered we would have been in trouble.<br>
Still, it's a start!</p>
