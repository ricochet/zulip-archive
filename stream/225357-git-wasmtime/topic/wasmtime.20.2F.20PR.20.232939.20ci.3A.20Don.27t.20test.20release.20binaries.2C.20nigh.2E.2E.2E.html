<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2939">PR #2939</a> from <code>less-release-test</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit attempts to slim down our CI (more from #2933) by removing<br>
testing both in debug and release mode. I can't actually recall a<br>
concrete issue that this has turned up on CI itself, and otherwise we're<br>
spending quite a lot of time building all of the dev-dependencies in<br>
release mode when testing.</p>
<p>Additionally it removes testing for nightly/beta channels of Rust. One<br>
of the main benefits of this, staying on top of breakage, is already<br>
moot because we pin to a nightly anyway. We have a few nightly<br>
references elsewhere in CI (fuzzing/docs) so we can largely rely on that<br>
(and upstream testing with rust-lang/rust). We in general shouldn't need<br>
to do nightly/beta testing on all builds.</p>
<p>The release builders were actually the only location that MinGW and<br>
AArch64 was tested however. This means that the old nightly/beta<br>
builders are now replaced with AArch64 and MinGW builders. Overall, the<br>
changes made to CI here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upgrade to QEMU 6.0.0. I thought this would make aarch64 emulation<br>
  faster, but it didn't. Seems good to stay up to date though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace nightly/beta testing in debug mode with MinGW and AArch64 testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>-g0</code> for C compilation on MinGW because otherwise <code>gcc</code> as used<br>
  on CI generates an ICE (!!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exclude <code>wasi-crypto</code> from testing. We already exclude<br>
<code>wasmtime-wasi-crypto</code> and it was an accident we were testing the<br>
<code>wasi-crypto</code> crate (which isn't even part of this workspace).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove testing DWARF on the old backend step, which nowadays didn't<br>
  actually do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove testing on release builders, making then purely tasked with<br>
  release builds, nothing else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename <code>QEMU_VERSION</code> to <code>QEMU_BUILD_VERSION</code> so qemu doesn't just<br>
  immediately exit after printing its version.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Timing wise the release builds are ~20-30 minutes faster, depending on<br>
the platform. This is not really because of testing time but rather we<br>
have a huge dependency tree when <code>dev-dependencies</code> are considered<br>
(criterion, tokio, proptest, ...).</p>
<p>MinGW tests are pretty fast since we don't run examples (we're not too<br>
interested in doing examples there, just windows/mac/linux coverage).<br>
AArch64 tests are run with optimizations enabled because unoptimized<br>
tests take ~45 minutes to finish while optimized tests take ~20 minutes.<br>
The build is naturally much faster in debug mode but apparently under<br>
QEMU emulation the debug mode binaries are <em>extremely</em> slow compared to<br>
the release binaries, which means that extra time we spend compiling<br>
release tests is more than made up by faster test emulation time.</p>
<p>Closes #2938</p>
