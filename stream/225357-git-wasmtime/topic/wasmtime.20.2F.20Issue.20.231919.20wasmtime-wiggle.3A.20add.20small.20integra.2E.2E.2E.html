<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>The <code>wasmtime-wiggle</code> crate is tested via its use in <code>wasmtime-wasi</code>. It does not have any tests local to the crate. We should add them.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>wasi is a very complicated interface &amp; implementation that could make it hard to track down whether a bug is in wiggle, wasmtime-wiggle, or wasi-common. Having a integration test would help us narrow that down. It would also serve as documentation on how to use the crate.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>The wiggle crate's test suite has a number of witx files and implementations. We could add tests that show those integrated end-to-end with wasmtime to the wasmtime-wiggle crate.</p>
<p>We would probably have to write the WebAssembly code that exercises these apis by hand (.wat). That is less than ideal, but I believe we should avoid adding the complication of a Rust or C wasm toolchain to the testing story.</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
