<blockquote>
<p>Right now, we do not have a notion of "code model", i.e., a set of definitions for ways in which external symbols are referenced. The code model affects which types of relocations we emit, and which address-generation strategies we use: for example, going through a global offset table (GOT) vs. embedding addresses directly, or using PC-relative addressing modes vs. not, or using instructions with differently-sized displacement limits. The closest concept that we have seems to be the <code>colocated</code> flag on external function references.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would like to add support for this as a global compiler flag so that it can influence codegen.</p>
<p>This came up in #1570; non-x86 architectures (such as AArch64) will need it more urgently as the displacement limits are often lower (e.g., on AArch64, +/- 128MB for calls without going through some sort of indirection or veneer).</p>
