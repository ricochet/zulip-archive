<blockquote>
<p>I've done some further investigation of this with @elliottt. We've got a clif function which before this commit took 15 seconds to codegen and after this commit took ~3 seconds. Profiling showed that virtually all time was spent in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/regalloc2/blob/v0.8.1/src/ion/merge.rs#L222-L226">this loop</a>. We worked together to develop a better means of merging sets there which reduced the compilation time of the test case in question, both before and after this commit, to ~0.2s. It turns out though that this new means isn't actually necessary since <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/regalloc2/blob/7662cd03a68cca771ced56fc6a9a0138716c306b/src/ion/merge.rs#L216-L221">the code has already changed on <code>main</code></a>! This means that relanding this should be a "simple" matter of updating regalloc2 first and then this can re-land.</p>
<p>This bodes well in my mind in that we were pretty surprised that this was the root cause of the regression. Tickling regalloc2 slightly different though makes a lot of sense and it made what was arguably already a pathological case even worse. Fixing the underlying pathology should provide some nice benefits!</p>
