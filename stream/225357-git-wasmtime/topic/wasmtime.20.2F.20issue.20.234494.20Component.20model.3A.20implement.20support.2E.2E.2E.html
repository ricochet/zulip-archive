<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>This is a tracking issue filed during the implementation of #4488.</p>
<p>The component model specifies that types can be imported and exported in components.</p>
<p>Previously, a component that imported or exported a type would hit an <code>unimplemented!()</code> panic.</p>
<p>With #4488, type exports are now explicitly ignored while type imports continue to hit the <code>unimplemented!()</code> panic.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that exports are useful with the current component model proposal as a way of giving a type a name, which is one way the component tooling can keep a faithful representation of the component's interface directly in the binary encoding.</p>
<p>The component model tooling does not make use of type imports yet, as those will be useful once the component model proposal includes support for resource types.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>Eventually type imports and exports will be used from components and Wasmtime will need to be able to instantiate such components.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>If type imports and exports remain in the component model proposal, Wasmtime will need to represent them both in the <code>Component</code> and <code>Instance</code> representations for components.</p>
<p>It will also need to properly implement resolving type imports and exports in a way that allows imports to be satisfied for component instantiation.<br>
