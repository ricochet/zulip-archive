As it was merged with the main 2 days after the 0.12 branch was created (the 5th) it hasn't been released. Is it possible to release a patch 0.12.1 with this commit? Also, this means the RELEASES <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6838">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6838</a> is not correct as this change was not included in 0.12.</p>
