<p>fitzgen opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3543">PR #3543</a> from <code>remove-peepmatic</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peepmatic was an early attempt at a DSL for peephole optimizations, with the<br>
idea that maybe sometime in the future we could user it for instruction<br>
selection as well. It didn't really pan out, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Peepmatic wasn't quite flexible enough, and adding new operators or snippets<br>
  of code implemented externally in Rust was a bit of a pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The performance was never competitive with the hand-written peephole<br>
  optimizers. It was <em>very</em> size efficient, but that came at the cost of<br>
  run-time efficiency. Everything was table-based and interpreted, rather than<br>
  generating any Rust code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, because of these reasons, we never turned Peepmatic on by default.</p>
<p>These days, we just landed the ISLE domain-specific language, and it is better<br>
suited than Peepmatic for all the things that Peepmatic was originally designed<br>
to do. It is more flexible and easy to integrate with external Rust code. It is<br>
has better time efficiency, meeting or even beating hand-written code. I think a<br>
small part of the reason why ISLE excels in these things is because its design<br>
was informed by Peepmatic's failures. I still plan on continuing Peepmatic's<br>
mission to make Cranelift's peephole optimizer passes generated from DSL rewrite<br>
rules, but using ISLE instead of Peepmatic.</p>
<p>Thank you Peepmatic, rest in peace!</p>
