<blockquote>
<p>I believe this is ready for review. During development I switched the design a fair bit, but I think the current one is reasonable for now. The <code>tracing</code> dep taken on by <code>wasmtime</code> is small enough that it should be ok, and @fitzgen plans to use <code>tracing</code> throughout cranelift and wasmtime soon.</p>
<p>Tracing can't be disabled at the moment. In the future, Nick plans to introduce <code>tracing_noop</code> crate in the cranelift tree so that spidermonkey doesn't have to vendor in the <code>tracing</code> ecosystem (they're particularly sensitive about vendoring deps, for good reason), and we can use that as a way to disable tracing in this crate once this lands. I don't think disabling it is worth blocking this change for now. </p>
<p>The example program at <code>crates/wiggle/test-helpers/examples/tracing.rs</code> demonstrates the use of <code>tracing-subscriber</code> and <code>log</code> as backends to the tracing statements emitted by wiggle. If you set the <code>RUST_LOG</code> environment variable, itll use <code>env_logger</code> to output, otherwise it'll use <code>tracing-subscriber</code>.</p>
