<p>My guess is that if possible it'd be best to break up the macro-instruction into its components to handle this. That way instead of using macro-instructions the helpers in ISLE can be used. This may not always be applicable though.</p>
<p>I did look at a few of these in <a href="http://emit.rs">emit.rs</a> though and they were related to things like sp adjustments and stack probe loops which I think could also reasonably be switched over to asserting that the constant fits in an instruction rather than requiring a pool. (so long as the range matches what one would reasonably expect for these situations)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We already sort of do this. We have <code>Inst::load_constant_u64</code> that tries to pattern match either a single <code>addi</code> or a <code>addi+lui</code> before falling back to the <code>LoadInlineConst</code> instruction as a last resort.</p>
<p>I'd eventually like to try and fully merge the load constant logic with some ISLE rules, but I'm not entirely sure how to do that.</p>

<p>Right now both <code>Inst::load_constant_u64</code> and ISLE call into <code>Inst::generate_imm</code>, but I'd like to build some more complex pattern matching in ISLE and still have it available in <code>emit.rs</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Makes sense! I was thinking that the "solution" there is to slowly whittle away at callers to <code>Inst::load_constant_u64</code> as opposed to refactoring the internals of that to use ISLE (which would probably be different given the required contexts), but that's naturally much easier said than done</p>
