<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2408">PR #2408</a> from <code>fix-use-after-free-trampoline</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit fixes an issue with wasmtime where it was possible for a<br>
trampoline from one module to get used for another module after it was<br>
freed. This issue arises because we register a module's native<br>
trampolines <em>before</em> it's fully instantiated, which is a fallible<br>
process. Some fallibility is predictable, such as import type<br>
mismatches, but other fallibility is less predictable, such as failure<br>
to allocate a linear memory.</p>
<p>The problem happened when a module was registered with a <code>Store</code>,<br>
retaining information about its trampolines, but then instantiation<br>
failed and the module's code was never persisted within the <code>Store</code>.<br>
Unlike as documented in #2374 the <code>Module</code> inside an <code>Instance</code> is not<br>
the primary way to hold on to a module's code, but rather the<br>
<code>Arc&lt;ModuleCode&gt;</code> is persisted within the global frame information off<br>
on the side. This persistence only made its way into the store through<br>
the <code>Box&lt;Any&gt;</code> field of <code>InstanceHandle</code>, but that's never made if<br>
instantiation fails during import matching.</p>
<p>The fix here is to build on the refactoring of #2407 to not store module<br>
code in frame information but rather explicitly in the <code>Store</code>.<br>
Registration is now deferred until just-before an instance handle is<br>
created, and during module registration we insert the <code>Arc&lt;ModuleCode&gt;</code><br>
into a set stored within the <code>Store</code>.</p>
