<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>This is asking for help/advice. I have JIT struct very similar to the one in the toy demo. I only generate code that builds a wrapper function that only calls a rust function. Mainly following those examples <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/jit/examples/jit-minimal.rs">(jit-minimal)</a> and (<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift-jit-demo/pull/60/files">cranelift-call rust function</a>). Now I instantiate one single instance for each thread from that JIT struct and use each independently only in their own thread to call the function through the pointer I get from that respective JITModule instance. The problem is that I'm getting segmentation faults randomly (as in sometimes they happen sometimes not) when I try to call the functions through the returned pointers and this happens only in multi threaded testing, I never had this issue a single time when I tested my code in single threaded environment. Are there any limitations to using the JITModule in multithreaded environments or any common pitfalls that I should watch for? If needed, I can try to write a minimal example (although wouldn't be very different from the samples above). </p>
<p>I even tried without calling free_memory at all and still the same problem (only when running in multiple threads as mentioned)</p>
<p>Random guessing, Is there anything shared across JITModules? Perhaps something related to those relocation tables?</p>

<p>I think incorrect premissions is the most likely issue. If selinux-fix fixes it, incorrect permissions is almost definitively the issue. Not quite sure why that would happen without selinux-fix though.</p>
