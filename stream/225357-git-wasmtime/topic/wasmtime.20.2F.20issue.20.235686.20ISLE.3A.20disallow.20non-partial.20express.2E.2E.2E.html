<p>It's a footgun: they will always succeed (should be using <code>if-let</code> to match on the result of the value, not <code>if</code> on whether anything is matchable).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought this would be something I could hack together between meetings, but it's trickier than I thought.</p>
<p>First off, I believe we can't do this during parsing/AST construction. We don't necessarily know whether a term is partial at that point since we may not have parsed its declaration yet.</p>
<p>During semantic analysis, we've already rewritten <code>(if foo)</code> into <code>(if-let _ foo)</code>, so we can't reject total terms only when they're inside an <code>if</code> construct. That's not a bad thing though, because really we shouldn't allow infallible <code>if-let</code> either.</p>
<p>An infallible <code>if-let</code> occurs if both the left-hand pattern and the right-hand expression are infallible/non-partial. That's not completely trivial to determine, in that we can't just check the top-level of either. We have to recurse through the whole subtree and reason about how, for example, and-patterns or let-binding expressions interact with match failures. Not a huge deal, but not "hack together between meetings" material.</p>
<p>There are some complicated cases. For one, <code>(if-let x (...))</code> may be infallible, in which case it's almost equivalent to a let-binding expression. However that might be useful as the only way to let-bind an expression for use in multiple <code>if-let</code>s. And <code>(if-let (extractor x) (...))</code> is the only way to call an extractor on an arbitrary expression, so even if the extractor is infallible this pattern could be necessary.</p>
<p>We could add a <code>(let)</code> construct for the left-hand side of a rule: functionally it would be identical to <code>if-let</code> but would suppress this infallible-if check and capture the rule-author's intent better.</p>
<p>I wondered if this would be any easier to check on the <code>trie_again</code> representation, after semantic analysis. This bug would show up as an unused binding-site. However, right now we generate unused binding sites in other ways that are harmless. Also, this is a property of a single rule, but we only build that representation on the combined set of all rules for a term, so determining where a binding site is "used" is non-trivial. So I think this is best done in semantic analysis.</p>
<p>Independent of this current issue, we should also consider checking for unused variable bindings, and checking that let-bindings only bind <code>_</code> for impure expressions.</p>
