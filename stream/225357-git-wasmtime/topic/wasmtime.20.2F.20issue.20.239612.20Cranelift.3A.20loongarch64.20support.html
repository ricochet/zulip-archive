<p>k0tran opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/9612">issue #9612</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>loongarch64 is a cpu architecture. Right now Rust has loongarch64-unknown-linux-gnu and loongarch64-unknown-linux-musl targets thanks to LLVM. I wonder if its support is even planned in cranelift.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>loongarch64 is already supported by Rust compiler - most crates you can compile to loongarch64 on loongarch64. One of exceptions to this general rule is the Zellij. It depends on the cranelift-codegen internally.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>TODO: Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>
algorithms to use?</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>TODO: What are the alternative implementation approaches or alternative ways to<br>
solve the problem that this feature would solve? How do these alternatives<br>
compare to this proposal?<br>
</p>

<p>Thanks for creating this issue! Are you interested in working on this?</p>
<p>I'll leave a link to <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1183#issuecomment-1684159806">this comment</a> giving a high-level picture of the timelines and costs associated with new-target support. We're a fairly small team and a new backend is a large project, so the most likely way this would happen is if someone steps forward and volunteers to do the work, and then stick around as a maintainer afterward.</p>

<p>Thanks, I see. I might try doing something. Although I'm pretty much sure that time requirements multiplied by my skill gap will result in too much time for porting one of terminal multiplexers (and creating cranelift backend in the process :D). But we'll see</p>
