<p>I'm very interested in seeing this issue fixed, since it has a significant impact on the usefulness of wasmtime-py; if you navigate to <a href="http://python.org" title="http://python.org">python.org</a> on Windows, either 32-bit or 64-bit, it always suggests you a 32-bit Python build, so most people certainly end up with 32-bit Python that cannot run wasmtime.pyd. Not only that, but the link to the 64-bit installer is somewhat hard to find, and there AFAIK isn't a redirect I can send to people to ask them to install 64-bit Python that is compatible with wamtime-py.</p>
<p>Could one of the developers more familiar with the codebase provide some guidance? I've tried running a few WASI applications with wasmtime targeting i686 Linux but they all crash with a register allocator issue that only ever mentions x86_64 registers (<code>rax</code>, etc) so I'm not sure if I'm doing something seriously wrong.</p>
<p>(I do understand that a Windows port is more complex--I've heard that SEH is going to be involved--but even an i686 Linux port would be useful, both on its own and as a starting point.)</p>

<p>Thank you for bringing this up, and for starting to work on it!</p>
<p>I at least wasn't aware of the unfortunate situation with 64-bit Python on Windows, which I agree makes this more important.</p>
<p>One thing to be aware of is that we're in the middle of a pretty big change to Cranelift, involving a rewrite of the instruction selector (and register allocator, but I don't think that's too important here.) I'm not sure how that factors in, but @cfallin, @bnjbvr, or @julian-seward1 would.</p>

<p>Hi @whitequark and thanks for working on it!</p>
<p>As Till pointed out, we're in the middle of switching the instruction selection and codegen backends in Cranelift. As a matter of fact, we're rewriting the codegen bits, which include recipes/encodings and all of this, to a simpler and more straightforward system (see for example the new <code>aarch64</code> directory under <code>codegen/src/isa</code>).</p>
<p>At this point, the current meta system should be considered in maintenance-only mode. Note that since the two codegen backend frameworks are very different, we won't be able to port x86 32 bits changes to the old backend onto the new backend, so this work will likely be thrown away.</p>
<p>Since there might be some time until we get to the final switch to the new system (and plain removal of the previous one), I don't think we should get in the way of good will. Meaning that if people want to submit patches, and other people want to review them, this is totally fine; this is useful up to the point where we switch to the new system.</p>
<p>Note there is a <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1605" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1605">work-in-progress PR</a> for a new x64 backend. This code could be a great base for a new x86 32-bits backend too, duplicating code for a new codegen backend, or sharing and reusing most of the x64 code there.</p>

<p>Ah, I see. In that case I would probably not put any effort towards a Windows port until the x64 backend is ready.</p>
