<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm not sure if my implementation is correct, so please correct me if my implementation or expectations are wrong.</p>
<h3>Test Case</h3>
<p>Example project is available <a href="https://github.com/YannikSc/wasmtime-leak">here</a></p>
<h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a wasmtime project with wasi support (wasmtime_wasi)</li>
<li>Build the <code>WasiCtx</code> with <code>inherit_env</code></li>
<li>Run a function a couple times</li>
<li>Leak memory</li>
</ul>
<h3>Expected Results</h3>
<p>It might be a user issue, as I'm not sure if my implementation is correct, but I would assume, that it is. </p>
<p>So in this case my expectation would be, that the memory at the end is likely the same as the one at the start.</p>
<h3>Actual Results</h3>
<p>The memory size at the end is (for 2000 function calls in my example) ~10 time bigger than at the beginning</p>
<h3>Versions and Environment</h3>
<p>Wasmtime &amp; Wasmtime_wasi version: 0.36.0</p>
<p><code>uname -srm</code>: Linux 5.17.5-zen1-1-zen x86_64</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> This also happens if the <code>env</code> method is used<br>

<blockquote>
<p>cc @sunfishcode this seems to be an unfortunate interaction between the current command support in LLVM/LLD and wasi-libc perhaps? I don't think that the problem is with <code>inherit_env</code>, rather simply any env var being defined. (this reproduces when defining just a single env var). Also note that this isn't a leak in Wasmtime, but rather then wasm module itself.</p>
<p>The <code>do_something</code> export is wrapped automatically by LLD so that every time it's called it first calls <code>__wasm_call_ctors</code> followed by a call to <code>__wasm_call_dtors</code>. For this particular wasm module the ctors initializes the environment but the dtors don't actually free anything, so the environment is initialized every time the function is called, which results in the apparent leak.</p>
<p>@sunfishcode is this perhaps updated in wasi-libc already? Does the Rust toolchain just need to update its wasi-libc version?</p>

<p>After some more checking, I can confirm that it happens also for only a single <code>.env()</code> call. </p>
<p>I also noticed a leak when using the <code>.preopened_dir()</code> function. I'm not sure if it's the same cause, but I thought it would be worth to mention.</p>

<p>That's likely the same issue where <code>__wasm_call_ctors</code> is repeatedly initializing internal state without either reusing prior state or cleaning up the prior state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The way the LLVM backend and wasm-ld work now is to assume that a "command", which is the default mode, is called into only once. To build a module that can be called into multiple times, the toolchain now expects users to build in "reactor". The rust toolchain unfortunately does not yet have a flag for enabling "reactor" mode. We should consider adding one. Though adding one that can be relatively stable will require answering complex questions about "what is a wasm cdylib?" and "what is a wasm reactor?" which have been difficult to answer while module-linking has been in flux.</p>
<p>It is a change from previous versions. It used to be the case that "command" executables were more forgiving about being called multiple times. Some things didn't work, and it wasn't ever documented or anticipated that calling into wasm modules multiple times would work, but it does appear to have turned out to work in practice for some users. When I made the change, quite a while ago at this point, I was trying to fix the things that didn't work, and I didn't realize how many people were depending on the old behavior continuing to work the way it did. These changes are now showing up in toolchains and unfortunately breaking these users' code.<br>

<p>I'm going to close this because I don't believe that this is a bug in Wasmtime itself, but @YannikSc if you'd like this would perhaps be a good candidate for opening as an issue on the wasi-libc repository.</p>
