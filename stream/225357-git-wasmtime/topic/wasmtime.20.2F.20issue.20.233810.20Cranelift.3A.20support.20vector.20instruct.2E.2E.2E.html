<p>In #3809, a new extension to our fuzzing found that some of our Wasm-SIMD support requires nominally optional ISA features, at least on x86-64.</p>
<p>I think we should <em>try</em> to have fallbacks such that we can support all relevant features on any machine that supports the base ISA. On x86-64, this means just SSE2. Or if this is very difficult for some reason, we should document why and then possibly consider raising our minimum required ISA version.</p>
