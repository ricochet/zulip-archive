<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4597">PR #4597</a> from <code>component-dfg</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit updates the inlining phase of compiling a component to<br>
creating a dataflow-based representation of a component instead of<br>
creating a final <code>Component</code> with a linear list of initializers. This<br>
dataflow graph is then linearized in a final step to create the actual<br>
final <code>Component</code>.</p>
<p>The motivation for this commit stems primarily from my work implementing<br>
strings in fused adapters. In doing this my plan is to defer most<br>
low-level transcoding to the host itself rather than implementing that<br>
in the core wasm adapter modules. This means that small<br>
cranelift-generated trampolines will be used for adapter modules to call<br>
which then call "transcoding libcalls". The cranelift-generated<br>
trampolines will get raw pointers into linear memory and pass those to<br>
the libcall which core wasm doesn't have access to when passing<br>
arguments to an import.</p>
<p>Implementing this with the previous representation of a <code>Component</code> was<br>
becoming too tricky to bear. The initialization of a transcoder needed<br>
to happen at just the right time: before the adapter module which needed<br>
it was instantiated but after the linear memories referenced had been<br>
extracted into the <code>VMComponentContext</code>. The difficulty here is further<br>
compounded by the current adapter module injection pass already being<br>
quite complicated. Adapter modules are already renumbering the index<br>
space of runtime instances and shuffling items around in the<br>
<code>GlobalInitializer</code> list. Perhaps the worst part of this was that<br>
memories could already be referenced by host function imports or exports<br>
to the host, and if adapters referenced the same memory it shouldn't be<br>
referenced twice in the component. This meant that <code>ExtractMemory</code><br>
initializers ideally needed to be shuffled around in the initializer<br>
list to happen as early as possible instead of wherever they happened to<br>
show up during translation.</p>
<p>Overall I did my best to implement the transcoders but everything always<br>
came up short. I have decided to throw my hands up in the air and try a<br>
completely different approach to this, namely the dataflow-based<br>
representation in this commit. This makes it much easier to edit the<br>
component after initial translation for injection of adapters, injection<br>
of transcoders, adding dependencies on possibly-already-existing items,<br>
etc. The adapter module partitioning pass in this commit was greatly<br>
simplified to something which I believe is functionally equivalent but<br>
is probably an order of magnitude easier to understand.</p>
<p>The biggest downside of this representation I believe is having a<br>
duplicate representation of a component. The <code>component::info</code> was<br>
largely duplicated into the <code>component::dfg</code> module in this commit.<br>
Personally though I think this is a more appropriate tradeoff than<br>
before because it's very easy to reason about "convert representation A<br>
to B" code whereas it was very difficult to reason about shuffling<br>
around <code>GlobalInitializer</code> items in optimal fashions. This may also have<br>
a cost at compile-time in terms of shuffling data around, but my hope is<br>
that we have lots of other low-hanging fruit to optimize if it ever<br>
comes to that which allows keeping this easier-to-understand<br>
representation.</p>
<p>Finally, to reiterate, the final representation of components is not<br>
changed by this PR. To the runtime internals everything is still the<br>
same.</p>
