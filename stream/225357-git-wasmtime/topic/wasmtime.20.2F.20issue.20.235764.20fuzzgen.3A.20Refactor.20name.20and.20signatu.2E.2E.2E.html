<p>Or perhaps we should always pass in the full list of libcalls; what test coverage do we gain by randomly removing libcalls from the list?</p>

<p>This is what ended up happening anyway in #5765, I'm going to backport that. I don't think we lose anything by doing it that way and its a bit cleaner.</p>

<p>It might be nice to only add function declarations to builder.func if they're actually used, but that's a separate matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that you mention it, that sounds like a great idea! And it solves one of the issues in #5765 which is that, the function "headers" become quite verbose if we pass in too many call targets which is annoying because they currently don't get reduced so even the smallest function possible is still has 6 lines of signatures + 6 lines of function references!</p>
<p>I'm going to give this a go. Would you prefer that as a separate PR or should I bundle it into this one?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I spent a while trying to figure out if this PR makes it any easier to move the list of ALLOWED_LIBCALLS to cranelift-fuzzgen so we don't have to keep it in sync across different modules with the list of supported interpreter implementations. I didn't come up with a good answer, but it's something I'd like to see, if you happen to have any ideas.</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of would be to make <code>Config</code> a associated constant of <code>TestCase</code>, doing a generic arbitrary impl for that and having something like</p>

<p>I think this could work, but I'm not sure if we can const eval that?</p>

<p>jameysharp <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5764#issuecomment-1431781405">commented</a> on <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5764">issue #5764</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding cleaning up the function header, I'm happy whether that's in this PR or separate. I'd take this PR even if you don't get around to that. So pick whichever is more convenient for you.</p>
<p>When I look at the associated constant idea, I wonder: why do we export types like <code>TestCase</code> from the cranelift-fuzzgen crate?</p>
<p>If we declared that struct in the cranelift-fuzzgen target instead, we just need to provide implementations of <code>Arbitrary</code> and <code>Debug</code> along with it. The current <code>Arbitrary</code> implementation is very short because it mostly delegates to the <code>FuzzGen</code> struct, and if we put that in the fuzz target then we have the opportunity to tweak the config there. The <code>FuzzGen::generate_host_test</code> method probably should get inlined in the implementation of <code>Arbitrary</code>. But the lower-level methods (<code>generate_flags</code>, <code>generate_func</code>, <code>generate_test_inputs</code>) are sensible things to share across multiple fuzz targets.</p>
<p>I think the same plan works for <code>FunctionWithIsa</code> too. Its current <code>Arbitrary</code> implementation is more complicated but I think all the complexity is reasonable to move to the cranelift-icache fuzz target.</p>
<p>I'd prefer if both <code>Debug</code> implementations call a shared helper from the fuzzgen crate too, for printing the target/flags/function body. Really, I want that even if we don't move these structs to the fuzz targets.</p>
<p>Again, though, none of that needs to happen in _this_ PR.</p>

<p>I've changed this to always pass all libcalls.</p>
<p>I like that idea of having each target defining its own Arbitrary type. I'll make that change as a separate PR!</p>
<p>Same thing with the function header cleanup, I'll do that in a separate PR.</p>
