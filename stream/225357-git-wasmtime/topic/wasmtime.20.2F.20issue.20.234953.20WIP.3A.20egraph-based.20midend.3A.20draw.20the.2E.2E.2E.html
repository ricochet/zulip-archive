<p>@jameysharp I think this is more-or-less ready for review now!</p>
<p>(In fact, I just spent a few hours doing the latest rebase, and these are fairly painful because this PR does a lot of code-motion to factor out ISLE commonalities for mid-end and backends, so I'd really prefer to try to get this merged before much more changes to avoid another rebase hell :-) )</p>
<p>I've updated the implementations of the various rewriting and elaboration algorithms to avoid explicit recursion, and I've factored out a generic "analysis" mechanism for the egraph crate to own; these were the main cleanups I wanted/needd to do before the prototype would be considered production-ready, I think. Regarding the rule-rewriting reentrancy issue, I opted to simply cap the recursion with a static limit (max of 5 chained rewrites) for now, as (i) we'll need such a limit anyway to protect against accidentally infinitely-(co)recursive rules, and (ii) it is about an order of magnitude simpler than unwinding the nested-immediate-rewrites into some sort of "pending node queue" and splitting the id-space, and probably more efficient in the common case.</p>
<p>In any case, let me know what you think -- I'm eager for feedback!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@alexcrichton it looks like the verify-publish CI job is failing <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/3179742540/jobs/5182545720#step:6:810">here</a> because for some reason it's looking for the (not-yet-published) cranelift-egraph crate on <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a> rather than in the workspace. I copied the magic incantations for workspace-inheritance from the other intra-repo deps but I'm not sure if I'm missing something -- it's surprising that this fails if all the other builds work fine?</p>
