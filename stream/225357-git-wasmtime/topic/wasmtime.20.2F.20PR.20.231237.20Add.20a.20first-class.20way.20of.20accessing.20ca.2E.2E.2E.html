<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1237" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1237">PR #1237</a> from <code>memory-arg</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit adds a first-class way to access a caller's memory when<br>
defining a <code>Func</code> implemented by the host. This is a very common usage<br>
scenario where the wasm module calls a host function with pointers to<br>
its own wasm memory, and the host function needs to read that<br>
information.</p>
<p>Currently, however, it's pretty roundabout to implement this<br>
functionality in wasm. Typically you'll have to set up an<br>
<code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Option&lt;Memory&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, close over that in your function imports,<br>
and then fill it in once the instance is created. The goal of this PR is<br>
to make it more ergonomic to implement this.</p>
<p>Note that eventually this is intended to be supplanted by interface<br>
types which automatically and safely convert from wasm memory to host<br>
objects. Interface types though is still aways out and it seemed like it<br>
would be prudent to have this functionality for users today.</p>
<p>Currently the shape of this functionality is to allow adding an argument<br>
to <code>Func::wrap*</code> closures of <code>Option&lt;Memory&gt;</code>. If available this option<br>
will be filled in with <code>Some</code> of the <em>caller's</em> memory. This ends up<br>
being <code>None</code> in a few places:</p>
<ul>
<li>The calling module may not actually have a memory</li>
<li>There may not be a calling module in the case that you directly call<br>
<code>Func::call</code> or similar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is also at least violating the spirit of the JS API,<br>
since there's no equivalent to this functionality there whatsoever.<br>
Additionally this breaks concepts of encapsulation because it means your<br>
memory can be accessed regardless of whether it's exported or not. To<br>
make matters even worse it has no way to cope with multi-memory, it<br>
simply returns <code>None</code> if there's more than one memory defined.</p>
<p>Overall this is intended to be <em>a convenience</em> or an escape hatch. As a<br>
host you sort of get the power to do whatever you want with the module.<br>
Empirically there's at least one major use case of this today, WASI.<br>
There's also been mentions on Zulip of other needs for something like<br>
this as well. This feels like it's basically useful enough that we<br>
should provide it today, with an eye towards deprecating it once<br>
interface types are implemented.</p>
