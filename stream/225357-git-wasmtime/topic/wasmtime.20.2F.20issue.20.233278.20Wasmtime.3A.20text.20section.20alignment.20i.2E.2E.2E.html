<p>IMHO the current solution could be improved further because depending on your definition of a platform, even a single platform may use different page sizes. For example, Ubuntu-based distributions running on AArch64 tend to use 4 KB pages, while RHEL-based ones prefer 64 KB as the size. Of course, a simple fix could be simply to increase the current hardcoded value (for that platform) from 4 to 64 KB, but I am not sure about the ramifications of that change (It is quite a big jump!).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I seem to recall having seen that each trampoline would get its own code page, as well as each wasm module, so this might cause a bit of allocation overhead. I don't know if we manage allocations at a sub-page granularity level; if so, that would probably be fine to have larger OS page sizes by default.</p>
<p>(I seem to fuzzily recall there are also security implications related to this, as larger page sizes make it easier to exhaust memory and then predict where a code allocation landed, effectively bypassing ASLR, but that might require additional conditions; maybe someone who's less fuzzy can confirm/contradict this.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current idea is that we want to be able to mmap the text section directly from within a file which is where the page alignment requirements comes in. I also tried to make it such that only the text section itself was made executable, but we could also just make whatever pages contain the text section executable, although that will make unrelated bits executable which seems bad.</p>
<p>I think it's probably fine to just round up to the most generous page sized used on a platform for now. It means that module serialized artifacts will have some extra 0's in them but most modules are going to be larger than 64k anyway. I don't think there's currently any need to optimize the raw format of a module for byte-size, especially since the compressed size will paper over this.</p>

<p>I tried increasing <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/7421e1a65b33a28068b4ccb7d520bdd4369e3aa9/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/mod.rs#L328">the default text section alignment</a> on AArch64 to 64 KB, but then I hit an issue, namely <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/crates/jit/src/code_memory.rs#L101">a check</a> in <code>CodeMemory::publish()</code>, which failed when I tried running the compiled module on a system with 4 KB pages. I am not sure how to proceed - I think we mostly care that the <code>.text</code> section is correctly aligned on the runtime page size, not the page size we assume when generating the object file. On the other hand, it feels wrong to ignore the alignment value we read from the object file. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Yeah I think it's safe to remove that assertion, that was  mostly me trying to double-check things but it doesn't serve much purpose and the assertion for page-alignment down below is all we really need.</p>
<p>Either that or we could specifically allow the <code>.text</code> section to "violate" its alignment for a documented reason.</p>
