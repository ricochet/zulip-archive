<p>After linearizing rule patterns for a given term, but before we insert those linear match ops into the trie, we should do a custom topological sort of the linear match ops's data-flow graph that seeks to maximize prefix sharing in the eventual trie:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a data-flow graph for each pattern</li>
<li>keep track of "emittable" match operations for each pattern, i.e. those operations whose operands are all already emitted so we can emit this operation if we choose</li>
<li>count which operations are most emittable across all patterns</li>
<li>select the operation with the highest count</li>
<li>for all patterns where this is an emittable operation:<ul>
<li>emit this operation next</li>
<li>recurse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for all patterns where that is not an emittable operation:<ul>
<li>choose the operation with the highest count among these remaining patterns</li>
<li>emit this operation next for these patterns</li>
<li>recurse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>repeat previous until all patterns have been accounted for</li>
</ul>
<p>This is greedy algorithm is not optimal, because we don't break ties between equally-emittable operations such that the final trie will have maximal prefix sharing. I can't think of an efficient way to do that right now. But I think this should get us very close to optimal in practice.</p>

<p>I think this is no longer necessary since ISLE doesn't use linearized matches any more. Please re-open if I've misunderstood it though.</p>
