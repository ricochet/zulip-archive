<p>abrown opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1444" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1444">PR #1444</a> from <code>fix-1342</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This relates to #1342; in #1335, @bnjbvr and I <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1335#discussion_r393784241" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1335#discussion_r393784241">discussed</a> that we should disallow code like <code>infer_rex().w()</code> in  the meta crate since the presence of a REX.W by necessity requires a REX prefix. To avoid ambiguity, we now require <code>rex().w()</code> instead.</p>
<p>Though all the tests pass, the tricky part of this PR is deciding whether the subsequent two commits, the "Skip extra work..." optimizations, are always correct. What these should do is avoid checks on the REX.W bit when we are dealing with a recipe that has inferred REX prefixes; since <code>infer_rex()</code> and <code>w()</code> can no longer go together, the thought is that we could avoid some (negligible) extra work checking for this bit when determining if a REX prefix is needed--i.e. we only need to check the RXB bits. I am open to removing these commits or adding tests (but which ones?) to prove this is correct since I am rather wary that the "we are dealing with a recipe that has inferred REX prefixes" assumption always holds.</p>
<p>I'll tag multiple people as reviewers for extra eyes.</p>
