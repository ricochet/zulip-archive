<blockquote>
<p>This commit moves all API examples (Rust and C) to a top-level<br>
<code>examples</code> directory. This is intended to make it more discoverable and<br>
conventional as to where examples are located. Additionally all examples<br>
are now available in both Rust and C to see how to execute the example<br>
in the language you're familiar with. The intention is that as more<br>
languages are supported we'd add more languages as examples here too.</p>
<p>Each example is also accompanied by either a <code>*.wat</code> file which is<br>
parsed as input, or a Rust project in a <code>wasm</code> folder which is compiled<br>
as input.</p>
<p>A simple driver crate was also added to <code>crates/misc</code> which executes all<br>
the examples on CI, ensuring the C and Rust examples all execute<br>
successfully.</p>
