<p>fitzgen opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/9868">issue #9868</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We suspect error strings are a major code size offender, and revamping <code>wasmtime::Error</code> to optionally (based on compile-time features) contain just error codes, instead of full strings, could improve code size.</p>
<p>And then for regular Wasmtime CLI builds, we would probably want something like</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">wasmtime</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">--</span><span class="n">explain</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1234</span>
<span class="n">Error</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1234</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">one</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">line</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">explanation</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">paragraph</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">with</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">more</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">detail</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">applicable</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Apparently the <code>defmt</code> and/or <code>pw_tokenizer</code> crates could be helpful here, although I have no experience with either of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For me <code>CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_OPT_LEVEL=s CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO=fat CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_STRIP=symbols CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_PANIC=abort cargo build -p wasmtime-c-api --release --no-default-features --features disable-logging</code> produces a 955kb dylib on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. Of this the total rodata size is just a little over 60kb. This is the upper bound on the size of the error messages.</p>
<p>With panic_immediate_abort (<code>CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_OPT_LEVEL=s CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO=fat CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_STRIP=symbols CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_PANIC=abort RUSTFLAGS="-Zlocation-detail=none" cargo +nightly build -p wasmtime-c-api --release --no-default-features --features disable-logging -Z build-std=std,panic_abort --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort</code>) the dylib is 531kb with only 34kb in rodata.</p>
<p>A quick look through the contents of the .rodata section shows that with panic_immediate_abort maybe half are error messages. A significant part of this however are not coming from <code>wasmtime::Error</code> but rather from various <code>eprintln!()</code> by wasmtime-c-api for unimplemented things, the crash message of the signal handler, various aborts in the internals of wasmtime, error messages produced by postcard, context messages for anyhow and things like that. As for the other half that are not error messages, they are things like cranelift flag names, names of libcalls and a whole lot of non-string data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way there is currently more space taken up by relocations (<code>.rela.dyn</code>) than <code>.rodata</code> and the actual code takes up 77% of the binary, there are probably bigger things to worry about than error messages.</p>

<p>The actual strings don't seem to be significant from those numbers. What might be more relevant use is heavy use of <code>std::fmt</code> and <code>anyhow::Error</code>, both of which create a whole lot of code in <code>.text</code> and (for PIC) relocations. It's difficult to estimate how much of a difference it makes without doing the hard work of switching over, but I've seen its traces often enough while digging through compiler output. Some specific points:</p>
<ul>
<li>With respect to <code>std::fmt</code>, even <a href="https://rust.godbolt.org/z/q38KjMYEY">a trivial function that just returns <code>format!("x = {x}")</code></a> takes 102 bytes of code. It's not clear to me if the GOTPCREL relocations make it into the final <code>.so</code> but at least the <code>&amp;str</code> pointers in the static data will do that. Both code size and relocations increase proportionally with the number of interpolated values and string pieces.</li>
<li><code>anyhow</code> builds heavily on string formatting, both directly with the <code>bail!</code>, <code>ensure!</code>, etc. macros and by converting every concrete error type into trait objects whose vtable includes <code>Debug</code> and <code>Display</code> impls, which are often full of more <code>std::fmt</code> code. (This is not really <code>anyhow</code>-specific, plain <code>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;</code> also does this.)</li>
<li>In addition, last time I checked <code>anyhow</code> unconditionally pulled in code for capturing and printing backtraces, which may negate some of the benefit of panic=abort and <code>panic_immediate_abort</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As higher-level anecdata: I have a (non-public) project where I recently replaced all uses of <code>anyhow::Error</code> with a mostly API-compatible error type that only stores a <code>String</code> internally, converts other error types to their <code>Display</code> outcome (never <code>Debug</code>), and doesn't support downcasting. Despite still using <code>std::fmt</code> to some extent, this change alone saved about 80 KiB from an opt-level=s, lto=true, stripped binary on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.</p>
