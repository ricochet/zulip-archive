<blockquote>
<p>When a block has only a single, unconditional predecessor, we should merge it into its predecessor. We see this relatively frequently do to the way that <code>cranelift-wasm</code> creates blocks (which can certainly be improved, but I think can't fully solve this issue).</p>
<p>One option is to do this during CLIF construction in <code>cranelift-frontend</code> when we call <code>seal_block</code>, as that is when we are declaring that all predecessors for a block have been linked up.</p>
<p>Another option is to do this somewhere in the mid-end, either when building the e-graph or when elaborating out of it.</p>
<p>We might want to do both, since legalization can also introduce new blocks.</p>
