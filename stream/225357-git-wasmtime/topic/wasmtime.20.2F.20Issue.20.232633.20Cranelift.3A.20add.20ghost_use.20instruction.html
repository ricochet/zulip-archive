<blockquote>
<p>&lt;!-- Please try to describe precisely what you would like to do in<br>
Cranelift/Wasmtime and/or expect from it. You can answer the questions below if<br>
they're relevant and delete this text before submitting. Thanks for opening an<br>
issue! --&gt;</p>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Add a new <code>ghost_use</code> instruction that accepts a value and ensures that the value can be found somewhere at runtime. It will codegen to no instructions.<br>
&lt;!-- What is the feature or code improvement you would like to do in<br>
Cranelift/Wasmtime? --&gt;</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>This allows extending the range for which variables are available in debuginfo beyond the last actual use of the variable. In addition it would for exanple allow a jit runtime to inspect the value for switching to and from speculatively optimized code.<br>
&lt;!-- What is the value of adding this in Cranelift/Wasmtime? --&gt;</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>The instruction will be marked as has_other_sideeffects. It will be lowered by backends to an instruction that doesn't result in any bytes being emitted. It will tell regalloc that the value needs to be available on either in a register or on the stack.<br>
&lt;!-- Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>
algorithms to use? --&gt;</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Force all variables to the stack, which regressed runtime performance</li>
<li>Accept that variables are only available until the last use, resulting in a sub-optimal debugging experience.<br>
&lt;!-- Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they<br>
better or worse than your proposal? --&gt;<br>
</li>
</ul>
