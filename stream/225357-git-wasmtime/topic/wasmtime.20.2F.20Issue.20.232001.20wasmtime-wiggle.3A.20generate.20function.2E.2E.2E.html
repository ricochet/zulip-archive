<blockquote>
<p>This is a good beginner issue that is scoped to the wasmtime-wiggle crate, at crates/wiggle/wasmtime.</p>
<p>See also #2000, cc @jedisct1 </p>
<p>I propose that <code>wasmtime_wiggle::wasmtime_integration!</code> generate an additional function <code>link_all(&amp;ctx, &amp;Store, &amp;mut Linker) -&gt; Result&lt;(), _&gt;</code> that constructs and links each module struct generated by the macro. This will make it hard to accidentally forget to instantiate and link in a module when maintaining an integration of several witx modules.</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Please try to describe precisely what you would like to do in<br>
Cranelift/Wasmtime and/or expect from it. You can answer the questions below if<br>
they're relevant and delete this text before submitting. Thanks for opening an<br>
issue! --&gt;</p>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>&lt;!-- What is the feature or code improvement you would like to do in<br>
Cranelift/Wasmtime? --&gt;</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>&lt;!-- What is the value of adding this in Cranelift/Wasmtime? --&gt;</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>&lt;!-- Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>
algorithms to use? --&gt;</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>&lt;!-- Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they<br>
better or worse than your proposal? --&gt;</p>

<p>Frank has pointed out that this is impossible since each module presently requires an owned <code>ctx</code> value, maybe using Rc&lt;&gt; in the ctx type will help here? This could have inadvertently revealed more problems that we hadn't thought of yet.</p>
