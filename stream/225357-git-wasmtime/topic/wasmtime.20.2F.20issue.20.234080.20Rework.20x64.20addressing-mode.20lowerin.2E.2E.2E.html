<blockquote>
<p>@fitzgen or @abrown, this should be ready for review now. I've stacked it<br>
on top of #4091 as otherwise it's a merge conflict. Updated description:</p>
<p>This PR refactors the x64 backend address-mode lowering to use an<br>
incremental-build approach, where it considers each node in a tree of<br>
<code>iadd</code>s that feed into a load/store address and, at each step, builds<br>
the best possible <code>Amode</code>. It will combine an arbitrary number of<br>
constant offsets (an extension beyond the current rules), and can<br>
capture a left-shifted (scaled) index in any position of the tree<br>
(another extension).</p>
<p>This doesn't have any measurable performance improvement on our Wasm<br>
benchmarks in Sightglass, unfortunately, because the IR lowered from<br>
wasm32 will do address computation in 32 bits and then <code>uextend</code> it to<br>
add to the 64-bit heap base. We can't quite lift the 32-bit adds to 64<br>
bits because this loses the wraparound semantics.</p>
<p>(We could label adds as "expected not to overflow", and allow <em>those</em> to<br>
be lifted to 64 bit operations; wasm32 heap address computation should<br>
fit this.  This is <code>add nuw</code> (no unsigned wrap) in LLVM IR terms. That's<br>
likely my next step.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, (i) this generalizes the cases we can handle, which should<br>
be a good thing, all other things being equal (and in this case, no<br>
compile time impact was measured); and (ii) might benefit non-Wasm<br>
frontends.</p>

<p>This is a pretty big change for CLIF: right now it is ~basically UB-free other than memory loads/stores (and invalid <code>raw_bitcast</code>s?). Division by zero, for example, is not UB and semantically raises a trap. Adding the equivalent of <code>add nuw</code> would be the first instance of UB we have in basic arithmetic instructions, and that's something we shouldn't do lightly. I think this will have subtle and far-reaching effects that aren't immediately obvious to us now. For example, verification/superoptimization would have to keep track of UB, explicitly represent it in the SMT queries they create, and then check refinement rather than equivalence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Updated! @abrown let me know if the additional comments make sense.</p>
<p>In the process of tweaking priorities to try to get everything to apply in the right order, I was hitting some weird behavior and suspect there may be an issue with priorities in general. I'm going to go play with that a bit now, but it shouldn't affect correctness here (the order in which rules apply seems wrong sometimes but the rules themselves are applied correctly).</p>

<p>Yeah, I've been digging into cases where I thought this might help and it seems that the adds are coming from bona fine <code>i32.add</code>s in the Wasm, not some part of the legalization of <code>heap_addr</code> with offsets; in this case we actually have to implement the wrapping behavior faithfully, so nevermind the above. I do agree as well actually that nondeterminism isn't the best answer here; if we come back to a similar issue later maybe the right answer is to just use <code>i64</code>s in the right spots (or the host pointer type) to avoid the extends.</p>
