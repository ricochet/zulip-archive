<p>@abrown I'm cleaning up old PRs and came upon this; do you think there are still improvements here that are useful to salvage? Constant-handling has changed quite a bit in the meantime (and much of it has been purged from my cache too) so it's hard for me to judge exactly which of the issues here are still relevant, but there may be some! :-)</p>

<p>As I remember it, the API could have been nicer; this was an attempt to do that. I think at this point, though, one would have to re-evaluate the new state of the API and try an almost-new refactoring. Let's close this!</p>
