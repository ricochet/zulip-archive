<p>abrown <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5907#issuecomment-1451041863">commented</a> on <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5907">issue #5907</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I marked this as "draft" for now because I'm not sure where this should live. It might be better up at the top level <code>tests</code> directory, which already would have built the Wasmtime CLI binary; in the current state there is no checking that it has been built yet. Additionally, if we end up adding more tests from the WASI testsuite, then we could share some of the infrastructure up there (note that currently <code>run_wasmtime_for_output</code> is cloned here from the <code>tests/all/cli_tests.rs</code> file).</p>
