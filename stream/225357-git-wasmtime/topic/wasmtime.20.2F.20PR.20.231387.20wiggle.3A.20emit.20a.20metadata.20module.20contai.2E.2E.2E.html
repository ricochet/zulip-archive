<p>pchickey opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1387" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1387">PR #1387</a> from <code>pch/wiggle_add_document</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over in Lucet, we'll be using some wiggle-adjacent proc macros to generate bindings to wasi-common. I'd like to make the witx document that wiggle used available in wasi-common's public interface so that I can generate the bindings straight from there, eliminating the possibility of getting our wires crossed.</p>
<p>The biggest issue I have with this PR is that it means all users of <code>wiggle</code> will have to take a <code>witx</code> runtime dependency that they otherwise may not need. If we want to avoid this, we could use cargo features to make the metadata module opt-in. The witx dependency for wasi-common could be hidden behind that feature flag. I haven't used cargo features as a library author before, or in a proc macro context, so I'd like to ask @alexcrichton for guidance on what the right way to approach this is.</p>

I'd like to make the witx document that wiggle used available in wasi-common's public interface so that I can generate the bindings straight from there, eliminating the possibility of getting our wires crossed.</p>
<p>The biggest issue I have with this PR is that it means all users of <code>wiggle</code> will have to take a <code>witx</code> runtime dependency that they otherwise may not need. In order to avoid this, wiggle emits the new metadata behind a new feature flag <code>wiggle_metadata</code> that consumer crates can opt-in to. As a result, we had to add the witx dependency to wasi-common, but its able to be optional if wasmtime doesnt want to use it. I haven't used cargo features as a library author before, or in a proc macro context, so I'd like to ask @alexcrichton for feedback if I did this right.</p>
