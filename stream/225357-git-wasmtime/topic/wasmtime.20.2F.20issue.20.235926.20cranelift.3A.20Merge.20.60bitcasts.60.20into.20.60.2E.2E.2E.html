<p>I'm curious whether the backends can do this optimization, if it's just about load-sinking. I'm not sure what it would take to get the load-sinking machinery to "see through" bitcasts.</p>
<p>I think the most general bitcast optimizations would be target-specific anyway. Something like, if both types are stored in the same register class, then the lowering for bitcast can just return the input register. I'm not sure how endianness interacts with that and I've probably missed other important details, but maybe there's something easy to try in there.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We could possibly do the same thing that we do on conditional branches with the <code>maybe_uextend</code> extractor: basically, build a little helper manually to do that "seeing through". It seems like a pretty reasonable manageable (i.e., not too high) level of complexity to me, vs. trying to reason about the combination in the mid-end.</p>
