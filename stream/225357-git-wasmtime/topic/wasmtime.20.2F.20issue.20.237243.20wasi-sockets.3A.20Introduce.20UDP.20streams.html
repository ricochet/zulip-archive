<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for this! I've got a few comments on some API design decisions as well as their implications on the implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Primarily I think it would be best to avoid the usage of <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> in the implementation. I feel like it's best to reflect the concurrency of the underlying OS which is that mutexes aren't required and concurrent calls to various bits and pieces are ok. I realize that mutexes aren't held during blocking I/O operations as a part of this PR, but that effectively means that the lock is overhead and I'd prefer to do away with it. I tested this out locally and the main issue that I ran into was that the inbound/outbound streams need access to the <code>remote_address()</code> of the state of the socket. This is problematic because, theoretically, a <code>start_connect</code> can race with a <code>send</code> or <code>receive</code> call, meaning that a <code>Mutex</code> is basically required to arbitrate that race (or something atomic like that). Could this perhaps be altered at the API level where an inbound/outbound stream is returned from <code>finish-connect</code> in addition to <code>finish-bind</code>? That way the streams from <code>bind</code> are never connected and the streams from <code>connect</code> are always connected. That may have weird implications if all the streams are used, though, so I'm not 100% sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bikeshed-wise the name <code>inbound-*</code> and <code>outbound-*</code> are inconsistent with <code>wasi:io/streams</code> usage of <code>input-*</code> and <code>output-*</code>. Is it perhaps worth it to use the same terminology?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bikeshed-wise the <code>oubound-datagram-stream</code> type is similar to <code>output-stream</code> but has a different mechanism for receiving data. The <code>output-stream</code> type for example has a <code>check-write</code> method which returns how much can be written and only then can <code>write</code> be called. Additionally <code>write</code> traps if too much is given to it. The main rationale for this design decision is that it avoids the need for callees to receive a possibly unbounded amount of data forcibly within their module (since calling <code>send</code> will copy over all the data into the second module if there is one). This may best be solved with a <code>check-write</code> lookalike for <code>outbound-datagram-stream</code> as well perhaps? </p>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree, yet I couldn't figure out how to make it work.<br>
My initial version had <code>bind</code> and <code>connect</code> both return streams. (Also I allowed connect to be called multiple times, but I didn't want to pollute this PR too much).<br>
In that setup, calling <code>connect</code> has to invalidate the previously returned streams somehow. At which point I ended up at Mutex again. Allowing the previous streams to remain somehow usable might be easier to implement, but is arguably a worse API design.</p>

<p>I (tried to) use the wasi-http naming scheme, as they feel more natural to the domain at hand (networking) as opposed to input&amp;output.<br>
Sidenote, I just noticed that wasi-http actually uses slightly different terminology (incoming&amp;outgoing) <span aria-label="no mouth" class="emoji emoji-1f636" role="img" title="no mouth">:no_mouth:</span> </p>
<p>For the stream types, I'm fine with either naming scheme. They're temporary anyway.<br>
For the datagram types themselves I do prefer to keep calling them incoming&amp;outgoing-datagram rather than input&amp;output-datagram.</p>

<p>Good point. I'll look into it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Even with a <code>check-write</code> method on <code>outbound-datagram-stream</code> that can still happen, right. I assume <code>check-write</code> will return the amount of datagrams that can be sent. But each datagram can still contain an unbounded number of bytes in the <code>data</code> field.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One way to get invalidation working without <code>Mutex</code> is to have a generational counter stored in each incoming/outgoing stream which is compared to the "current generation", an atomic counter, stored within the <code>Arc</code>. That way invalidation would be "increment the generation" and that may work out?</p>
<p>For naming ok sounds like we're already a bit inconsistent, so I think it's ok to keep the names here <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span> </p>
<p>For <code>check-write</code> you're correct that you can always still pass in more data, but implementations can trap when this happens vs being expected to work correctly. I also think that for datagrams the number returned from check-write should probably be "size of all datagrams summed up" since you're right that the size of an individual datagram can change. Unless we can place a hard cap on the size of the datagram though in which case implementations could trap if any individual datagram is too large.</p>

<p>Potentially answering my own question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>calling connect has to invalidate the previously returned streams somehow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than performing validation in the *-stream code, maybe we can require the consumer to have dropped all prior child streams before calling <code>connect</code> (again) and trap otherwise. That way it should be impossible to have multiple competing streams active at the same time. </p>

<p>Ah I think we raced there a bit, but I like your idea more of requiring the streams are dropped than my idea of a generation counter</p>

<p>This is ready for review again.</p>
<p>I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the API to disallow multiple pairs of active streams.</li>
<li>Updated the API to mostly match wasi-io's <code>input-stream</code> &amp; <code>output-stream</code>.</li>
<li>Removed the mutex</li>
<li>Renamed the resources to align with wasi-http.</li>
