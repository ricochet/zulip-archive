<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1971">Issue #1971</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First implemented in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1969">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1969</a> the easiest thing at the time was calling out to intrinsic functions to implement <code>global.{get,set}</code>, which means that there are no JIT fast paths for these operations. At the time of this writing there's no toolchain that uses <code>global.{get,set}</code> so we don't have a ton of motivation to make this fast, but I wanted to file this issue to make sure we don't forget about it and in case it comes up in the future!</p>
<p>For now it's likely safe to not worry about the performance here, but if this becomes a hot spot in the future this can be a point of coordination!</p>
