<p>Currently this isn't possible with <code>bindgen!</code>-generated bindings. You'll have to use <code>Linker</code> APIs directly and thread around the <code>StoreContextMut&lt;T&gt;</code> that you're given to the point where the recursive call is needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I briefly tried the threading approach by only minimally modifying the generated trait methods, which was only seems possible with lots of handwavy unsafe code. It looks like I might unfortunately need to do a hybrid approach where I copy-paste the generated linking code but scrap the traits in favour of handwritten inline code to be able to do the shrinking and extension of the store data to and from the host state without unsafe code.</p>
<p>Perhaps at some point this could be supported by the bindings generator, e.g. by passing the state and a function that can temporarily extract the host resource trait being implemented / by passing &amp;mut self as is but also proving a function that temporarily re-extends &amp;mut self back into the store context (this would probably require unsafe in the implementation but would still be a safe interface to provide).</p>
<p>The other aspect I’m still unclear on is how to give the host resource access to the guest resource, since the former is defined before instantiating when setting up the linker, and the latter is only available once an instance has been created. Do you have any hints for that?</p>

<p>One option I've considered in the past is that this could be done on a per-method basis. For example most trait methods could take <code>&amp;mut self</code> but they could be allow-listed to take <code>store: StoreContextMut&lt;T&gt;</code> instead. I'm not entirely sure how the <code>T</code> would be specified though but that might be part of the macro configuration.

<p>That sounds like a good idea! While manually updating all bindings code was definitely some work, it was interesting to do, though I would of course prefer being able to automate this in the future.</p>

<p>Yes, I moved forward as far as I could and can now show my remaining problem.</p>
<p>This is from my slow-burning attempt to make a crate to support cross-component serde by encoding the serializer + deserializer protocol using wit. In this latest attempt to see how far I can go, I have focused only on the <code>Serialize</code> on the guest and <code>Serializer</code> on the host part, for which the wit file is here: <a href="https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/wasmtime-ser/wit/serde-ser.wit">https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/wasmtime-ser/wit/serde-ser.wit</a></p>
<p>Let's take the example of <code>serialize_some</code>, which is added to the linker here: <a href="https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider/bindings.rs#L524-L558">https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider/bindings.rs#L524-L558</a>. After some setup, we need to wrap the to-serialize resource we got from the guest inside <code>SerializableSerialize</code> so that <code>serde</code> can serialize it, which happens by calling the <code>serialize</code> method on the guest here: <a href="https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider/bindings.rs#L543-L544">https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider/bindings.rs#L543-L544</a>.</p>
<p>The question is where to get the <code>guest</code> from. At the moment, the <code>SerializableSerialize</code> just provides it via a <code>todo!()</code> here: <a href="https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider.rs#L892">https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider.rs#L892</a>.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, we're inside a hostside resource method and need to call a guestside resource method. The hostside method is defined when setting up the linker, but as far as I can tell the guestside method is only retrieved when we instantiate the components after linking (at least that's what the bindings code seems to do). Is there a way in the hostside callback to dynamically get the guestside method, or can we somehow feed the guestside method back into the hostside code?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems like the core module linker provides host functions access to a caller struct (<a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Caller.html">https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Caller.html</a>), which allows looking up exports, here: <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Linker.html#method.func_new">https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Linker.html#method.func_new</a></p>
<p>But the component linker only provides the mutable store context here: <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/component/struct.LinkerInstance.html#method.func_wrap">https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/component/struct.LinkerInstance.html#method.func_wrap</a></p>
<p>If this functionality is currently not possible, perhaps the component linker could also give host functions access to a caller struct?</p>

<p>Thanks for detailing a bit more, I can definitely see how this is tricky. From a WIT perspective what you're describing is not possible to do because imports cannot refer to types in the exports.

<p>If you have enough ahead-of-time knowledge what you'll be required to do is to load the exports of the component and put them in the <code>T</code> of <code>Store&lt;T&gt;</code> ahead of time. They can later be accessed during the host import call.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I came across this design restriction several months ago already. At the moment, my hacky solution is to manually lower and lift some resources into integer handles to break this cycle. This does make the protocol work, but I see how the design also informs what APIs can then be written.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That sounds like a reasonable approach to me. As the interface has both an export and an import part, which bindgen exposes through initialise methods anyways, I think I could adapt this API to stash the guest exports into the host state in the store.</p>
<p>While I think this would work if only one component is initialised, do you have an idea for what would could be done when multiple components are initialised? When the host export is called from a component, how could I find out which instance called it, so that I could look up the corresponding guest export stashed inside the host store state?</p>

<p>I think the best approximation is on the embedder side you store within <code>T</code> of <code>Store&lt;T&gt;</code> which component was the last to start the call. That way when an import is called you can read that and see which component started the call originally. Would that work?</p>
