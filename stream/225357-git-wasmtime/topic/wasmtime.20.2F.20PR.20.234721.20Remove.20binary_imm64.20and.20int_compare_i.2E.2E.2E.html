<p>jameysharp opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4721">PR #4721</a> from <code>remove-imm-insts</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no idea yet whether this is a good change, and it definitely<br>
should not be merged as-is. The main issues are that there are a bunch<br>
of tests I haven't fixed up, and some optimizations I've removed. Also I<br>
have no performance measurements yet to see what effect this has on<br>
either compile time or generated code quality.</p>
<p>I just wanted to understand what the <code>*_imm</code> instructions were used for,<br>
and trying to grep for them didn't work out well. So I removed them to<br>
let the compiler tell me where they're used instead.</p>
<p>To avoid having to make as many changes, I introduced a <code>InstImmBuilder</code><br>
trait. It provides methods like <code>iadd_imm</code> which emit the pair of<br>
instructions that legalization would have decomposed that instruction<br>
into eventually anyway.</p>
<p>I have several questions that this may help with answering:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is there significant savings, in IR code size and/or compile time,<br>
  from inlining one immediate operand into some instructions at the<br>
  frontend? Or is the widespread frontend use of these instructions just<br>
  for convenience?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can simple_preopt cleanly identify arithmetic identities involving<br>
  constants without rewriting to use these combined forms?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a compile-time cost to simple_preopt rewriting into combined<br>
  forms, only for legalization to rewrite them away again soon after?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;!--</p>
<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>
the PR.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>
  here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>
  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>
  first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>
</li>
<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>
  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so. The list of<br>
  suggested reviewers on the right can help you.</li>
