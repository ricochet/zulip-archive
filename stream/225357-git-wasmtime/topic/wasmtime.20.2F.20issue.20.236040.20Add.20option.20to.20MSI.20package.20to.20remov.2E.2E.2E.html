<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for filing a feature request! Please fill out the TODOs below.</p>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>First off, thanks to all who work on this great product. I'm sorry to whinge.</p>
<p>I just installed wasmtime 6.0.1, and noticed in the Control Panel that 6.0.0 was still on my machine. I know that some people like to have multiple versions of wasmtime on their machine for regression testing or other reasons, but I'd like to see an option in MSI to remove previous versions.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>This feature would reduce clutter on one's drive.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>All this would entail is adding the option when packaging the app in MSI Package Builder.</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>The alternative is to keep doing what I do, i.e., manually remove the older package via Control Panel. It's an unnecessary hassle.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting us know! I suspect this wasn't a deliberate decision; many of us working on Wasmtime just aren't that familiar with Windows.</p>
<p>I think the place to fix this would be in either <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/ci/build-tarballs.sh">ci/build-tarballs.sh</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/ci/wasmtime.wxs">ci/wasmtime.wxs</a>, right? Do you think you could put together a pull request to fix this?</p>
<p>Also, maybe @peterhuene can weigh in on this.</p>

<p>I am entirely unfamiliar with Wix to figure out how to make this work (back when I worked at Microsoft there were others responsible for producing our installers), but it seems reasonable to me to have the installer replace previous patch versions.</p>

<p>I am entirely unfamiliar with Wix to figure out how to make this work (back when I worked at Microsoft there were others responsible for producing our installers), but it seems reasonable to me to have the installer replace previous patch versions automatically, with an option (if possible) to remove previous majors too.</p>
