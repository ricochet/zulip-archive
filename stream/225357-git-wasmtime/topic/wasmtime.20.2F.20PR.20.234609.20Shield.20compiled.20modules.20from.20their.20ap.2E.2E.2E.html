<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4609">PR #4609</a> from <code>fix-a-test</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit fixes #4600 in a somewhat roundabout fashion. Currently the<br>
<code>main</code> branch of Wasmtime exhibits unusual behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <code>./ci/run-tests.sh</code> is run then the <code>cache_accounts_for_opt_level</code><br>
  test does not fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <code>cargo test -p wasmtime --lib</code> is run, however, then the test<br>
  fails.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This test is indeed being run as part of <code>./ci/run-tests.sh</code> and it's<br>
also passing in CI. The exact failure is that part of the debuginfo<br>
support we have takes an existing ELF image, copies it, and then appends<br>
some information to inform profilers/gdb about the image. This code is<br>
all quite old at this point and not 100% optimal, but that's at least<br>
where we're at.</p>
<p>The problem is that the appended <code>ProgramHeader64</code> is not aligned<br>
correctly during <code>cargo test -p wasmtime --lib</code>, which is the panic that<br>
happens causing the test to fail. The reason, however, that this test<br>
passes with <code>./ci/run-tests.sh</code> is that the alignment of<br>
<code>ProgramHeader64</code> is 1 instead of 8. The reason for that is that the<br>
<code>object</code> crate has an <code>unaligned</code> feature which forcibly unaligns all<br>
primitives to 1 byte instead of their natural alignment. During <code>cargo
test -p wasmtime --lib</code> this feature is not enabled but during<br>
<code>./ci/run-tests.sh</code> this feature is enabled. The feature is currently<br>
enabled through inclusion of the <code>backtrace</code> crate which only happens<br>
for some tests in some crates.</p>
<p>The alignment issue explains why the test fails on a single crate test<br>
but fails on the whole workspace tests. The next issue I investigated<br>
was if this test ever passed. It turns out that on v0.39.0 this test<br>
passed, and the regression to main was introduced during #4571. That<br>
PR, however, has nothing to do with any of this! The reason that this<br>
showed up as causing a "regression" however is because it changed<br>
cranelift settings which changed the size of serialized metadata at the<br>
end of a Wasmtime cache object.</p>
<p>Wasmtime compiled artifacts are ELF images with Wasmtime-specific<br>
metadata appended after them. This appended metadata was making its way<br>
all the way through to the gdbjit image itself which mean that while the<br>
end of the ELF file itself was properly aligned the space after the<br>
Wasmtime metadata was not aligned. This metadata changes in size over<br>
time as Cranelift settings change which explains why #4571 was the<br>
"source" of the regression.</p>
<p>The fix in this commit is to discard the extra Wasmtime metadata when<br>
creating an <code>MmapVec</code> representing the underlying ELF image. This is<br>
already supported with <code>MmapVec::drain</code> so it was relatively easy to<br>
insert that. This means that the gdbjit image starts with just the ELF<br>
file itself which is always aligned at the end, which gets the test<br>
passing with/without the <code>unaligned</code> feature in the <code>object</code> crate.</p>
