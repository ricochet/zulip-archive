<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1851">PR #1851</a> from <code>fuzz-less</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit disables Cranelift's debug verifier for our fuzz targets.<br>
We've gotten a good number of timeouts on OSS-Fuzz and some I've<br>
recently had some discussion over at <a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/3944">google/oss-fuzz#3944</a> about this<br>
issue and what we can do. The result of that discussion was that there<br>
are two primary ways we can speed up our fuzzers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One is independent of Wasmtime, which is to tweak the flags used to<br>
  compile code. The conclusion was that one flag was passed to LLVM<br>
  which significantly increased runtime for very little benefit. This<br>
  has now been disabled in <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz/issues/229">rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz#229</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other way is to reduce the amount of debug checks we run while<br>
  fuzzing wasmtime itself. To put this in perspective, a test case which<br>
  took ~100ms to instantiate was taking 50 <em>seconds</em> to instantiate in<br>
  the fuzz target. This 500x slowdown was caused by a ton of<br>
  multiplicative factors, but two major contributors were NaN<br>
  canonicalization and cranelift's debug verifier. I suspect the NaN<br>
  canonicalization itself isn't too pricy but when paired with the debug<br>
  verifier in float-heavy code it can create lots of IR to verify.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This commit is specifically tackling this second point in an attempt to<br>
avoid slowing down our fuzzers too much. The intent here is that we'll<br>
disable the cranelift debug verifier for now but leave all other checks<br>
enabled. If the debug verifier gets a speed boost we can try re-enabling<br>
it, but otherwise it seems like for now it's otherwise not catching any<br>
bugs and creating lots of noise about timeouts that aren't relevant.</p>
<p>It's not great that we have to turn off internal checks since that's<br>
what fuzzing is supposed to trigger, but given the timeout on OSS-Fuzz<br>
and the multiplicative effects of all the slowdowns we have when<br>
fuzzing, I'm not sure we can afford the massive slowdown of the debug verifier.</p>
