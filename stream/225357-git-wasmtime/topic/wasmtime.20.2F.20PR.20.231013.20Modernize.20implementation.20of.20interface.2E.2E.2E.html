<p>alexcrichton edited <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1013">PR #1013</a> from <code>wasm-interface-types-update</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit is the start of the modernization of the implementation of<br>
interface types in wasmtime. This has a long way to go, and like the<br>
previous iteration, chunks of it are already destined to get thrown<br>
away.</p>
<p>The current state of affairs is that the implementation of interface<br>
types in wasmtime feels very "bolted on" because, well, it was! The<br>
<code>wasmtime-interface-types</code> crate is not well integrated with the<br>
<code>wasmtime</code> API crate. Additionally it implements an older version of the<br>
interface types proposal dating back to when it was still based on<br>
WebIDL bindings. The goals of this PR are to integrate interface types<br>
into the <code>wasmtime</code> API crate as well as update the implementation to<br>
the current proposal, which is more instruction/adapter based.</p>
<p>Support here is built on top of the tools in the [wasm-interface-types]<br>
repository which contain various pieces of functionality like parsing<br>
the text format, parsing the binary format, stringifying the binary<br>
format, and validating the binary format. These tools are intended to be<br>
developed standalone from Wasmtime itself to encourage other users (like<br>
<code>wasm-bindgen</code>, a generator for interface types).</p>
<p>This should also fix a number of integration issues around the interface<br>
types demos we have (eventually) since wasm-bindgen is targeting the<br>
wasm-interface-types family of crates rather than the older WebIDL<br>
bindings proposals.</p>
<p>The current status of this commit/PR is that it is a step in the right<br>
direction but incomplete. I started this work a few months ago when I<br>
had some more time and have been occasionally rebasing it on the current<br>
<code>wasmtime</code> master branch. Only a few simple instructions are supported<br>
(and it's all via an interpreter, nothing compiled), and "hard" things<br>
like strings have yet to be done.</p>
<p>What is implemented, however, falls into categories like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>API integration into the <code>wasmtime</code> crate is sorted out</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>ValType</code> type is enhanced with interface types.</li>
<li>The <code>Val</code> type is enhanced with interface types values.</li>
<li>The <code>Config</code> type has a gate for the interface types proposal like<br>
  it does all other proposals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>wasmtime-interface-types</code> crate is deleted and all users are<br>
  migrated to the <code>wasmtime</code> crate exclusively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The test harness has been enhanced with an invented <code>*.wast</code> syntax to<br>
  cover interface types. I basically add things like <code>s8.const foo</code> as<br>
  well as updated the parser to be able to parse <code>@interface</code><br>
  directives. Again this is sort of an invented format, but the<br>
  intention is that we can easily write <code>*.wast</code> tests the same way for<br>
  interface types how we do for the core spec.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think we want to land this as-is because of how little of<br>
interface types it implements. Additionally there's parallel work that's<br>
been happening in Cranelift to jit interface types stubs which we may<br>
wish to sync up with as well. In any case the main purpose of this<br>
commit is to add fuel to the interface types discussion and hopefully<br>
give us something concrete to work with as well.</p>
