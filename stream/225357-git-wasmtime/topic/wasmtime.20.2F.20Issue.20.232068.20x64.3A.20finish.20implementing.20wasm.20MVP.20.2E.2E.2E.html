<p>One more general comment, in response to Chris' general comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It also strikes me (as a driveby thought) that we really should try to unify the sequence-of-instruction-lowerings between lowering time and emission time; the way in which we do a late expansion at emission time when there is local control flow involved is kind of bothersome. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually like the ability to hide a bunch of real insns inside a single <code>X64::Inst</code>.  I think it gives us a lot of flexibility without adding global complexity.  I've use this facility quite extensively in the aarch64 atomics work, too.  My only concern (and it is a big one) is that of correctness with respect to register allocation, when there are tmp regs used inside the sequence, or earlyclobber inputs.  As I commented several times above, I think we should step back, get our story about them straightened out, and audit.</p>
<p>I suspect that at least some part of the reason that Ion compiles so much faster than us is that it processes fewer, larger "units", and I wonder if that's a trick we can adopt, without sacrificing generated code quality.  For example, a single <code>Insn</code> that does an compare and (one-way? two-way?) conditional branch; similar for conditional moves; trap if reg nonzero, or trap if (reg &amp; imm) nonzero.</p>
