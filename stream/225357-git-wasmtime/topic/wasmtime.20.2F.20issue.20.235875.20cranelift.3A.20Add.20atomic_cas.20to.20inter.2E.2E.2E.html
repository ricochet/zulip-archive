<p>Sure thing. I shall add it to the relevant test files.</p>
<p>As for further help on the interpreter, I am still learning to walk with Rust and grokking the project as a whole. I am, however, very keen to contribute so point me in the right direction and I will help out anyway I can <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span>.</p>
