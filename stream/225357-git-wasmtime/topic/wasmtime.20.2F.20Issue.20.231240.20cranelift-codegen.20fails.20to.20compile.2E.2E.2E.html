<p>I initially tried adding <code>is_call</code>, but that requires <code>analyze_call</code> to return a valid <code>CallInfo</code>. As the instructions in question are not normal calls and don't have a <code>Signature</code>, it is not possible to return a valid <code>CallInfo</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can TlsGetAddr be hoisted in LICM? Eligible for DCE?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes and yes, I think.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And since the call takes an argument in rdi, if there needs to be a signature for verifier reasons, it looks like we can synthesize one of the form (rdi) -&gt; rax?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How would that signature get assigned to the instruction? It is not possible to lower the instructions to libcalls, as they require a very specific combination of x86 instructions for the linker to handle it correctly.</p>

<p>was surprised to learn cargo build --no-default-features --features std didn't work to show this, but that seems to be a consequence of this issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During compilation the build script detects the current architecture and automatically enables support for it. (at least if there are no archs enabled through feature flags)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So my current thinking is the following: since this can't be emulated properly with a call, maybe the proper way here is to add a new accessor on the opcode? I've got a wip patch that does this, with a new property called "clobbers_all_regs", and which is tested during register allocation in place of the opcode comparisons. I thought about other names, like "emulates_call", but this seems to be the most explicit, at the very least.</p>

<p>Was actually working on the same, but named it <code>clobbers_all</code> :)</p>

<p>This was first mentioned by @stefson in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/pull/1174#issuecomment-595205081" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/pull/1174#issuecomment-595205081">this comment</a>.</p>
<p>I agree with @bjorn3's assessment <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/pull/1174#issuecomment-595217112" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/pull/1174#issuecomment-595217112">in reply</a>. Since TLS access assumes a C ABI, would it make sense to just add <code>is_call</code> as an attribute to these opcodes? Edit: this depends on other questions like, can <code>TlsGetAddr</code> be hoisted <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/cranelift/codegen/src/licm.rs#L139-L141" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/cranelift/codegen/src/licm.rs#L139-L141">in LICM</a>? Eligible for <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/cranelift/codegen/src/dce.rs#L14-L15" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/cranelift/codegen/src/dce.rs#L14-L15">DCE</a>? And interaction with the verifier?  Given that it <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/pull/1174/files#diff-868c004db6bfd05b9f83082219c3389fR3296-R3299" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/pull/1174/files#diff-868c004db6bfd05b9f83082219c3389fR3296-R3299">includes a call</a> I think this might be the right way to go about it. And since the call takes an argument <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/pull/1174/files#diff-868c004db6bfd05b9f83082219c3389fR3285-R3290" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/pull/1174/files#diff-868c004db6bfd05b9f83082219c3389fR3285-R3290">in rdi</a>, if there needs to be a signature for verifier reasons, it looks like we can synthesize one of the form <code>(rdi) -&gt; rax</code>?</p>
<p>A wider concern: does anyone have ideas on how we'd build Cranelift under these different, more specific, feature flag combinations? I was surprised to learn <code>cargo build --no-default-features --features std</code> didn't work to show this, but that seems to be a consequence of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4753" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4753">this issue</a>. It seems appropriate to have some test crates that build under feature flag combinations we want to support, so issues like this get caught in CI. It would raise build times a bit, but I'm not sure how much. Does that sound acceptable?</p>
