<blockquote>
<p>The latest oss-fuzz build <a href="https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/log-517be847-bbd1-4bb6-9c8f-f0afd89a6f21.txt">failed here</a> and it's because the <code>ahash</code> crate at 0.8.2 no longer builds on the latest nightly. This appears to be due to the fact that the crate's build script is automatically enabling a feature that is no longer present in nightly Rust.</p>
<p>Updating to v0.8.7 finishes a build correctly, but this update also pulls in a new dependency on a crate called <code>zerocopy</code> which itself depends on <code>zerocopy-derive</code>. The derive macro is ~1kloc and generates a good deal of <code>unsafe</code> code and the <code>zerocopy</code> crate itself is also quite large and contains a lot of <code>unsafe</code> code with a lot of fiddling. Basically this one is not going to be an easy vet.</p>
<p>I wanted to open an issue on this though to track what to possibly do. </p>
<p>One option is to perhaps try to remove this dependency. This comes through the <code>hashbrown</code> crate and it appears optional so we may be able to remove it, but I'm also not sure if we specifically rely on this being a more performant hash than the otherwise default-selected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The zerocopy-derive dependency only happens when the derive feature of zerocopy is enabled, which ahash doesn't enable. It is a cargo bug that the lockfile contains it anyway.</p>
