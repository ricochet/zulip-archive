<p>Cool, thank you for this! There's no one "perfect" approach to profiling, so having more options on more platforms is great.</p>
<p>In case you weren't aware, I want to mention we recently merged a built-in profiler in Wasmtime that works on all platforms. It has some limitations, but in exchange, it doesn't require installing samply or perf or anything else.</p>
<p>It would be great if you could add some documentation for using samply with Wasmtime's perfmaps—especially if you can cover how to do it on macOS. See <a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/examples-profiling.html">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/examples-profiling.html</a> for the existing docs; the sources are in this repo in <code>docs/examples-profiling*.md</code>.</p>
<p>Even if Alex hadn't already merged this I was going to suggest that the documentation could be a separate PR, but now that it's merged it should definitely be a separate PR. <span aria-label="laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f606" role="img" title="laughing">:laughing:</span> </p>

<p>yes I'm aware of the profiler, super cool work! (I also made a separate project that is very similar in <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/wasmprof">https://github.com/Shopify/wasmprof</a>)</p>
<p>my main use case for samply is profiling both native code (not running inside the wasm sandbox) and the wasm code, so the native wasmtime profiler (or wasmprof) do not work for me! (This is mostly because we embed wasmtime in a bigger application, so I'm interested in the whole system performance not just the code running in wasm)</p>
<p>And yes, I'll make a PR for docs too, thank you for the suggestion!</p>
