<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Provide support for wasi-experimental-http, for instance, this one <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http">https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http</a>, over specific CLI flag</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>Currently there is now stereotypical way to perform HTTP requests over wasmtime runtime, but it's mandatory MVP feature, since much work performed via network sockets, for instance, interacting with AWS/Azure/etc cloud SDKs can be performed only via HTTP(S)</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>Support for wasi-experimental-http can be provided as build-in functionality, like for neural nets or cryptography, which are already had been implemented as wasmtime features, and should be available via CLI flag<br>
Maybe it's better to introduce some plugins management subsystem in wasmtime, but now it seems to be redunant</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>Unfortunately there is now adequate alternatives, other than recompile wasttime from source codes and inject http crate mentioned above<br>
