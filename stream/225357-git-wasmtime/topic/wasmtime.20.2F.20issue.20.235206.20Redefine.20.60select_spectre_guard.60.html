<p>If we can I think it would be ideal to fit at least one bit for the trap code since wasm traps need to ideally distinguish between <code>MemoryOutOfBounds</code> and <code>TableOutOfBounds</code> here. The full-blown 4-byte trap code is definitely not needed for wasm, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hmm -- adding a side-table to hold some instruction data out-of-band, or picking just a single bit of trapcode to store, both seem somewhat suboptimal to me. We could do either if we <em>needed</em> this, but I'm trying to understand the need: is the argument for this fusion based only on the question of what <code>select_spectre_guard</code> means otherwise? Because answering that question seems much easier to me; in fact the answer is basically "just <code>select</code>, but always a cmove in machine code / never folded away".</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess my main question is, why make the backends handle the general case if we don't need it? My impression is that would be a little annoying if we kept all the iflags infrastructure, and worse as we're removing it.</p>
<p>Besides, we've been talking about smaller numbers of more complex instructions as one of the tools in our toolbox for reducing time spent in Cranelift. Since these two instructions are always paired, I figured they seem like a natural candidate for that. In the most extreme case, we could stop legalizing <code>heap_addr</code> and add corresponding pseudo-instructions in the backends. I don't currently have an intuition for how the trade-offs work out among these options.</p>
<p>I've considered the counter-argument that the <code>icmp</code> might be optimized away if it's the same as a preceding one. I don't think that's currently possible, because the backends always lower this pair of instructions together, regardless of whether the <code>icmp</code> was already lowered for another use. At this point we'd need machine-code peephole optimization for that, I think.</p>
<p>I don't see any other way that this split has a performance advantage in either compile time or run time, and some chance that a combined instruction might have an advantage in both.</p>
<p>In short: I don't know if this is a good idea, but I don't currently understand why we'd prefer the status quo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would it be useful to merge <code>select_spectre_guard</code> into a new variant of <code>trapz</code>? So <code>spectre_trapz v0, heap_oob, v1</code> would trap with <code>heap_oob</code> if <code>v0</code> is zero, and otherwise it would evaluate to <code>v1</code>. But in case of a branch mispredict, it would evaluate to zero on the speculated path.</p>
<p>This would work safely with the idempotent side-effects machinery: as long as an identical instruction dominates the current one, you can reuse its result instead of evaluating it again, and be assured that both the trapping side-effect and the Spectre guard are preserved.</p>
<p>It also fits into the approach we're discussing in #5908: we'd be able to write ISLE rules that rewrite this instruction to <code>v1</code> if <code>v0</code> is known to be non-zero. That's safe as long as <code>v0</code> doesn't depend on an earlier unguarded branch, which we've been discussing is something we need to think about regardless.</p>
<p>With #6080, this could also be rewritten to an unconditional trap if <code>v0</code> is known to be zero. This is always safe no matter what earlier branches we've seen.</p>
<p>With #6055, during elaboration, we could rewrite this to a plain <code>trapz</code> if its result is unused.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this! In conjunction with a "no path-sensitive deductions" rule that we hold throughout optimizations, I think the constant-folding you're describing would be safe too. To elaborate on that a bit (@jameysharp and I talked offline a bit about this with others a few days ago):</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to be safe even in misspeculated executions of bounds-checks (this is "Spectre safety");</li>
<li>In such an execution, we can ensure safety by short-circuiting an accessed memory address to NULL or another safe value based only on a comparison result, and not a branch (this relies on a microarchitecture guarantee that no value speculation is occurring, which we generally have, either explicitly via <code>csdb</code> barriers on aarch64 or via Spectre-safety recommendations on other CPUs);</li>
<li>If we're going to optimize the cmove used for that short-circuiting, the "choice" input can't have the wrong value, even speculatively, relative to other values in the executed path;</li>
<li>So we can't make any deductions and do constant propagation based on conditional or indirect branches (which <em>can be</em> speculated).</li>
</ul>
<p>Concretely this would mean that if we have a rule that sees <code>brif v0, truthyblock(...), falsyblock(...)</code>, we <em>cannot</em> const-fold any Spectre-guards based on <code>v0</code> being truthy in <code>truthyblock</code>. So if we want to fold <code>spectre_trapz v0, ...</code> with <code>v0</code> known to be <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, we have to avoid such reasoning. But we don't currently have any such deductions, and we can keep it that way; then this unlocks some other nice optimizations, unless we've missed something...</p>

This seems kind of tricky while the <code>spectre_trapnz</code> is not fused as a single instruction with the load.</p>
<p>For example this clif:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="WebAssembly"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">v</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="err">=</span> <span class="err">icmp</span> <span class="err">ugt</span> <span class="err">index,</span> <span class="err">heap_bound</span>
<span class="err">v</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="err">=</span> <span class="err">iadd</span> <span class="err">index,</span> <span class="err">heap_base</span>
<span class="err">v</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="err">=</span> <span class="err">spectre_trapnz</span> <span class="err">v</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="err">,</span> <span class="err">heap_oob,</span> <span class="err">v</span><span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="err">v</span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="err">=</span> <span class="err">load.</span><span class="kt">i32</span> <span class="err">v</span><span class="mi">2</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>we would want to make sure does not expand into something like</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="NASM"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">    </span><span class="nf">mov</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">v1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">index</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nf">add</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">v1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">heap_base</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nf">mov</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">v2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nf">test</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">index</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">heap_bound</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nf">cmova</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">v2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">v1</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nf">ja</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">trap</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nf">mov</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">v3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">v2</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="nl">trap:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nf">ud2</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>where there is an unnecessary jump-to-<code>ud2</code> (created by <code>MInst::TrapIf</code>) because of the way that <code>spectre_trapnz</code> is lowered independently of the <code>load.i32</code>.</p>
<p>It seems like we <em>could</em> match <code>load(spectre_trapnz(...))</code> in the backends to make sure we generate the right code here, but this also seems a bit fragile and not obviously better than the <code>spectre_guard</code> variant I proposed above to me.</p>

<p>I think what happened here is that I forgot that it's the <code>load</code>/<code>store</code> that traps, not a preceding conditional-trap instruction. Which means I'm not sure we have the pattern anywhere that a conditional trap precedes a <code>select_spectre_guard</code>, in which case the instruction I'm suggesting isn't one that we would use anywhere. So… nevermind?</p>
<p>We probably still do want the kind of "no path-sensitive deductions" rule that Chris described, though.</p>
