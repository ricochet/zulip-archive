<p>YjyJeff opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6437">issue #6437</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After reading the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/ir.md#overall-structure">Overall Structure section in IR</a>, I found the <code>sum</code> variable is explicitly placed in the stack with <code>ss0 = explicit_slot 32</code>. However, the loop induction variable <code>i</code> is not placed explicitly placed in the stack.  The document said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such variables can also be presented to Cranelift as [stack slot]s. Stack slots are accessed with the <code>stack_store</code> and <code>stack_load</code> instructions, and can have their address taken with <code>stack_addr</code>, which supports C-like programming languages where local variables can have their address taken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am confused about when should we create a <code>StackSlot</code>. What is the advantage of <code>StackSlot</code> over <code>Variable</code> like <code>i</code> in the above?  In my view, all of them are in the stack, there is no difference here. I searched a lot and did not find the answer. Could anyone explain it?  </p>
<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>which is not quite true: in the example you linked, <code>i</code> is never stored on the stack; it exists only as SSA values. That is exactly the difference: <code>StackSlot</code> is an allocation of <em>memory</em>, and you can load and store to it whenever you like; <code>Variable</code> is an abstraction in <code>cranelift_frontend</code> that builds <code>Value</code>s, which are values computed in your program that may only live in registers. You can load a stack-slot to get a value, and you can store a value to a stack-slot; but a stack-slot itself is not a value.</p>
