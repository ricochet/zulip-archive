<p>pnevyk <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2748#issuecomment-974897068">commented</a> on <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2748">issue #2748</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What was the reason for changing the <code>free_memory</code> signature from <code>&amp;mut self</code> to <code>mut self</code>?</p>
<p>I have a struct that encapsulates <code>JITModule</code> and compiles expressions to functions, while storing the raw pointer into internal vector and returning only an index to this vector which identifies the expression for later evaluation. In <code>Drop</code> of my struct I was calling <code>self.module.free_memory</code>, which I believe was safe to do, because no raw pointers got out to the user of my struct.</p>
<p>When I updated to the current version with this change, the borrow checker is not happy anymore. What is the intended usage of <code>free_memory</code>?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT: I now see the benefit of this change of guaranteeing that the method is called at most once. However, since it is unsafe function, I think it could stay <code>&amp;mut self</code>, not preventing the use cases as mine.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
