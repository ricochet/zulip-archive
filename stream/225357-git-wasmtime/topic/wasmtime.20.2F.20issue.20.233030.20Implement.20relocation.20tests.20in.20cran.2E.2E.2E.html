<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Currently we do not perform any tests on the relocations that the backends emit. While implementing #3026 I struggled with getting the correct output partially because I did not have a good way to check what was being emitted.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>Testing relocations is obviously desirable to prevent regressions and to ensure we get the correct output.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>@cfallin has <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3026#issuecomment-867858249">suggested</a> two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>We perform an end-to-end test with a relocation and execute that on a target platform.</li>
<li>Print the relocations in the VCode output and compare them against a golden output in the compile filetests</li>
</ul>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>We can keep going as is, but it would be nice if we could test this<br>
