<p>ethindp opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3495">issue #3495</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/364">this pull request</a> for wasmparser, making it function in no-std environments (since if someone wants to use (say) cranelift-wasm in a no-std environment it wouldn't build at the moment because wasmparser is not no-std and it requires it). I was politely informed that I would need to open a discussion about merging it here, or else my PR would <em>not</em> be merged (even though this PR does not in fact touch wasmtime in any way and is completely unrelated to it). So, this issue is for the discussion for merging that PR. The PR does not modify any behavior of wasmparser or wasmtime, nor does it alter the development flow of (any) new developers (although they will simply have to avoid certain dependencies). However, that shouldn't be a problem, since wasmtime is an incremental wasm parser, and is media-agnostic as to where the wasm comes from.<br>
The PR alters the dependency tree of wasmparser by adding the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/no-std-compat">no-std-compat</a> and an <code>extern crate</code> declaration above all use declarations in <a href="http://lib.rs">lib.rs</a>. Additionally, I added a feature called <code>std</code> to facilitate the importation of <code>libstd</code>, and enabled it by default. Other than that, the code for the library is identical. This nullifies any reasons not to add no-std support to wasmparser, at minimum. CD/CI builds can be satisfied by adding another task to bench/test the wasmparser crate without any default features and with only the deterministic feature but not <code>default</code>/<code>std</code>.<br>
Crates that should be avoided in wasmparsers development are typically any crates that depend on modules within <code>libstd</code> that aren't also in <code>liballoc</code> or <code>libcore</code>. (This is mitigated a bit by emulating mutexes/locks with spin and hashmaps with hashbrown, but things that touch the filesystem, networking, threads, processes, etc., should be avoided.) However, as I said previously I don't foresee any reason why wasmparser would ever need any of this functionality.</p>

<p>I think that's one of the main issues with supporting <code>#![no_std]</code>. It means that the crate can never, EVER, rely on the standard library. That's a pretty severe limitation for any project. No <code>println!</code>, no <code>std::string</code>, nothing.</p>
<p>While I can understand the reasoning behind _why_ <code>#![no_std]</code> support would be desirable for your use case (I'm assuming you want to use wasmparser in an environment where libc is unavailable), I can also sympathize with the developers on this one.

And that can put the maintainers in a very difficult position because they have to say "no" to future development unless there's a <code>#![no_std]</code> equivalent.

It is possible other features developed in the future may also have no <code>#![no_std]</code> equivalent.</p>
<p>I think it's more than fair for the maintainers to be cautious about limiting the project to a <code>#![no_std]</code> compile target for their projects.

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No println!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no reason why a compiler backend or wasmparser should ever want to print to stdout. If they ever start doing this I would immediately open an issue for it. During development you can use one of the macros from the log crate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>no std::string</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>#![no_std]</code> doesn't mean no liballoc. <code>std::string</code> is a re-export of <code>alloc::string</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things like the JIT compiler in wasmtime do not have a #![no_std] equivalent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cranelift can easily get <code>#![no_std]</code> support. In fact in the past it used to have it (there is still a feature flag), but it was left bitrotting. Only the final step to mark the jitted code as executable requires OS support, but the embedder is the one responsible for this anyway. It can do the respective OS call or page table manipulation itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible other features developed in the future for wasmparser may also have no #![no_std] equivalent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't imagine what kind of feature for a parser would need an OS to function. In addition having a parser directly interact with the OS seems like a recipe for a security issue to me. In any case it is possible to provide an <code>std</code> feature flag to enable libstd usage and then gate this feature behind the feature flag.</p>

<p>Wasmtime and cranelift-jit don't work, but cranelift-jit is small enough that you can easily write your own replacement that uses a different interface as necessary.</p>

<p>I partially agree. Wrt to wasmtime I fully agree, but wrt cranelift-codegen the cost is pretty small IMHO. Not that I think I can convince others except maybe (and only maybe) by forking cranelift with <code>#![no_std]</code> support and updating it for an extended period to the latest version to show that it is easy to update.</p>

<p>As I said in the opening comment of this issue, why would wasmparser ever need anything within libstd that isn't in liballoc or libcore? Why would wasmparser need <code>println!</code>, processes, threads, networking, or OS-specific functionality? This is a parser, not a JIT compiler or runtime environment (and even a JIT compiler can be made in no_std environments, its just harder).</p>

</blockquote>
<p><code>std::error::Error</code> is in fact in std, not a re-export out of libcore or liballoc. as someone that maintains no_std crates this has been a complication for users that want to seamlessly convert to <code>anyhow::Error</code> (because there _is_ a <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow/1.0.45/anyhow/struct.Error.html#impl-From%3CE%3E"><code>From</code></a> for that conversion, and this gets used in <code>?</code>-unwrapping). wasmparser _does_ use that trait (<a href="https://docs.rs/wasmparser/0.81.0/wasmparser/struct.BinaryReaderError.html#impl-Error"><code>BinaryReaderError</code></a>) so this is an impl and behavior that would have to be conditional on <code>std</code>. i think this is the most obvious (and generally problematic) case, but there are other features libstd that are not related to OS-specifics, but are often reached-for tools in Rust.</p>
<p>i don't see that impl changed in the <code>no_std</code> PR; it looks like this won't build unless the dependency tree accidentally includes <code>std</code>? this is exactly what the third point in the Wasmtime <code>no_std</code> policy document is getting at; testing against regressions in <code>no_std</code> builds is not free, and is jarring to find a local patch that passes local checks fails under a particular CI environment.</p>
<p>i think it would help everyone to understand your use case for a <code>no_std</code> wasmparser. <code>build-std</code> ought to get most uses most of the way, are you unable to use a nightly Cargo? changes to get <code>build-std</code> working for all platforms are changes further upstream in Rust, but do have a wider benefit than getting individual crates working in a particular environment.</p>

<p><code>std::error::Error</code> is in fact in std, not a re-export out of libcore or liballoc. as someone that maintains no_std crates this has been a complication for users that want to seamlessly convert to <code>anyhow::Error</code> (because there _is_ a <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow/1.0.45/anyhow/struct.Error.html#impl-From%3CE%3E"><code>From</code></a> for that conversion, and this gets used in <code>?</code>-unwrapping). wasmparser _does_ use that trait (<a href="https://docs.rs/wasmparser/0.81.0/wasmparser/struct.BinaryReaderError.html#impl-Error"><code>BinaryReaderError</code></a>) so this is an impl and behavior that would have to be conditional on <code>std</code>. i think this is the most obvious (and generally problematic) case, but there are other features in libstd that are not related to OS-specifics, but are often reached-for tools in Rust.</p>
<p>i don't see that impl changed in the <code>no_std</code> PR; it looks like this won't build unless the dependency tree accidentally includes <code>std</code>? this is exactly what the third point in the Wasmtime <code>no_std</code> policy document is getting at; testing against regressions in <code>no_std</code> builds is not free, and is jarring to find a local patch that passes local checks fails under a particular CI environment.</p>
<p>i think it would help everyone to understand your use case for a <code>no_std</code> wasmparser. <code>build-std</code> ought to get most uses most of the way, are you unable to use a nightly Cargo? changes to get <code>build-std</code> working for all platforms are changes further upstream in Rust, but do have a wider benefit than getting individual crates working in a particular environment.</p>

<p><code>#![no_std]</code> will get a crate working on all targets, including those which can't be upstreamed like custom kernel targets or other custom targets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, I opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/364">this pull request</a> for wasmparser, making it function in no-std environments (since if someone wants to use (say) cranelift-wasm in a no-std environment it wouldn't build at the moment because wasmparser is not no-std and it requires it). I was politely informed that I would need to open a discussion about merging it here, or else my PR would <em>not</em> be merged (even though this PR does not in fact touch wasmtime in any way and is completely unrelated to it). So, this issue is for the discussion for merging that PR. The PR does not modify any behavior of wasmparser or wasmtime, nor does it alter the development flow of (any) new developers (although they will simply have to avoid certain dependencies). However, that shouldn't be a problem, since wasmtime is an incremental wasm parser, and is media-agnostic as to where the wasm comes from.<br>
The PR alters the dependency tree of wasmparser by adding the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/no-std-compat">no-std-compat</a> and an <code>extern crate</code> declaration above all use declarations in <a href="http://lib.rs">lib.rs</a>. Additionally, I added a feature called <code>std</code> to facilitate the importation of <code>libstd</code>, and enabled it by default. Other than that, the code for the library is identical. This nullifies any reasons not to add no-std support to wasmparser, at minimum. CD/CI builds can be satisfied by adding another task to bench/test the wasmparser crate without any default features and with only the deterministic feature but not <code>default</code>/<code>std</code>.<br>
Crates that should be avoided in wasmparsers development are typically any crates that depend on modules within <code>libstd</code> that aren't also in <code>liballoc</code> or <code>libcore</code>. (This is mitigated a bit by emulating mutexes/locks with spin and hashmaps with hashbrown, but things that touch the filesystem, networking, threads, processes, etc., should be avoided.) However, as I said previously I don't foresee any reason why wasmparser would ever need any of this functionality.</p>
