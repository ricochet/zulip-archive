<p>Currently whenever an instance is created <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/bffce37050abb22e3f07583a9a695ac790236f91/crates/runtime/src/instance/allocator.rs#L524">Wasmtime will calculate the <code>VMOffsets</code> structure</a> (also for the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/bffce37050abb22e3f07583a9a695ac790236f91/crates/runtime/src/instance/allocator/pooling.rs#L580">pooling allocator</a>). This <code>VMOffsets</code> structure which is actually <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/bffce37050abb22e3f07583a9a695ac790236f91/crates/environ/src/vmoffsets.rs#L50-L92">quite large</a> is also stored within the <code>Instance</code> allocation for each instance. This means that every instantiation is redoing this work and additionally "wasting" space by storing this in each <code>Instance</code>.

<p>I think a better solution would be to perhaps store the <code>VMOffsets</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/bffce37050abb22e3f07583a9a695ac790236f91/crates/runtime/src/instance.rs#L63"><code>runtime_info</code> field</a> since this information is statically known when the module is created and it can live in one location in the module and be referenced indirectly by each instance. The reason I hesitate to do this though is that accessing the vmoffsets would then become a dynamic function call (since <code>ModuleRuntimeInfo</code> is a trait). as opposed to today where information is at a static offset within <code>Instance</code>. I'm worried about the runtime impact of naively moving this information behind <code>ModuleRuntimeInfo</code> (since <code>VMOffsets</code> is pretty hot).</p>
<p>I'm not sure how best to solve this immediately, but some possibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>We could store a raw pointer, returned by <code>ModuleRuntimeInfo</code>, into <code>Instance</code> so we call the indirect function once at construction and then never again.</li>
<li>The <code>ModuleRuntimeInfo</code> could perhaps return an <code>Arc</code> "package" of various other bits and pieces of information that don't need to go through a virtual lookup. Or otherwise we could do away with the <code>ModuleRuntimeInfo</code> trait and instead have some sort of structure there which is precomputed for each <code>Module</code> (this would be a large-ish refactoring).</li>
</ul>
<p>And possibly other strategies as well. Given the relatively low impact of having this stored in each instance though this isn't the most pressing issue.</p>
