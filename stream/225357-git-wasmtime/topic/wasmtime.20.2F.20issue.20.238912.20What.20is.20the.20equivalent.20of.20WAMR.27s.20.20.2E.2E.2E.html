<p>Hello</p>
<p>This is a question, not an issue/problem.</p>
<p>I have been trying to reimplement HarfBuzz's wasm shaper in <code>rustybuzz</code>, using Wasmtime <a href="https://github.com/RazrFalcon/rustybuzz/pull/122">here</a>. HarfBuzz uses <code>wasm-micro-runtime</code> (WAMR) and makes heavy use of <code>wasm_runtime_module_dup_data</code> to pass in buffers.</p>
<p>I know how to write memory into an arbitrary location in the machine's memory. What I can't figure out is how to choose an appropriate place to write in the buffer. </p>
<p>What I am currently doing is growing the memory, and write there. However, many of the buffers are much, much smaller than a page, and surely this isn't sustainable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Generally the way that you get a pointer to write to within a guest module is to somehow call malloc. In the modules you're working with is a <code>malloc</code>-like symbol exposed to invoke to get a pointer into linear memory of where to write?</p>
<p>One point to note, however, is that you'll want to be sure that the guest module is aware that it's receiving allocated memory from the host so it knows to deallocate it when it's done with it.</p>

<p>Yeah HarfBuzz's example modules do not export a <code>malloc</code> at all. Looking at <code>wasm_runtime_module_dup_data</code> it seems to do some logic that bypasses that, but I am illiterate at C++.</p>

<p>The pattern throughout the API is as follow: there is a <code>struct</code> defined with a pointer field. say <code>struct Blob { length: u32, data:u32 }</code> and the imported function is called with <code>blob: *mut Blob</code> parameter. Then I, as the host, am supposed to pass in a pointer to the array of data, or binary data, in the <code>data</code> field.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AFAIK whatever <code>wasm_runtime_module_dup_data</code> is doing (I haven't read it myself) is probably non-standard and specific to WAMR. It can likely be done with Wasmtime APIs but that would require understanding what WAMR is doing which would likely require reading the internal implementation details as this is something that's probably not documented.</p>
