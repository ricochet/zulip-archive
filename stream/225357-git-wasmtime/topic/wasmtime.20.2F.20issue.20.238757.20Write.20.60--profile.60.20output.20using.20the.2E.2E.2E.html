<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Enable wasmtime to output CPU profiles in the VS Code-compatible <code>.cpuprofile</code> format.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>Right now wasmtime can take guest profiles using the <code>--profile=guest</code> flag, but these profiles are stored in <a href="https://profiler.firefox.com">Firefox profiler's <code>.json</code> format</a>. VS Code can natively render CPU profiles, but only using the <code>.cpuprofile</code> format. This is a JSON-based format, which shouldn't be too different from Wasmtime's existing output - but it would be neat if Wasmtime profiling support directly integrated with VS Code.</p>
<p>The flow I have in mind here is that we would add support for some <code>--profile</code> flag to language native toolchains. So that you could run e.g. <code>cargo test --profile</code>, or maybe even hit the <code>profile</code> button in VS Code - and then that outputs a performance profile which can be directly visualized in VS Code like so:</p>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>Ideally we'd just switch over the existing profile format to <code>.cpuprofile</code>. That seems better than adding additional config - and I believe the Firefox profiler can already load those. I also don't think there is any loss of information if we do that?</p>
<p>If we can't do that, adding a flag could be another option. But it seems better to not add more config if we can help it. I think this should mostly just be a different way we encode the same information, so I imagine the change here should be fairly self-contained within Wasmtime.</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>The main alternative here would be to handle this in the language-native tooling, taking the existing output and rewriting it to the <code>.cpuprofile</code> format. But since I believe the <code>.cpuprofile</code> is equivalent to what Wasmtime outputs already, and also already appears to be supported by the Firefox profiler, it might be better to make this change directly in Wasmtime.</p>

<p>It is not clear to me how the cpuprofile format would represent profiling multiple threads at the same time. I also can't find anything to encode events/markers (instants in time where something happened like the exact moment an http request was received by wasi-http)</p>

<p>Completely agreed that if we in fact lose information by switching to <code>.cpuprofile</code>, then yeah we shouldn't switch over the base wasmtime output. There could potentially be value in integrating it with language-native tooling. But that's beyond the scope of this issue.</p>

<p>Even if we don't switch the default I think it's reasonable to support. The <code>--profile</code> option already supports <code>--profile guest,other-path.json,10ms</code> and we could extend that to something like <code>--profile guest-vscode</code> or <code>--profile guest,vscode</code> or something like that.</p>
