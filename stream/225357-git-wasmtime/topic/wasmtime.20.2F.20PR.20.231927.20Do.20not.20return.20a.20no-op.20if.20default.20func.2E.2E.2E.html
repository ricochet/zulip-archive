<p>This PR changes the <code>linker.get_default()</code> deafult return value. It removes the return of a no-op function as this is rarely what users of the method would want.</p>
<p>This has been briefly discussed in the zulip bytecode alliance channel.</p>
<p>I do not know how to add test cases to this, it seems that there were no tests around it, but I'm happy to add some if anyone could guide me on where to put them.</p>
<p>I am unsure who the right reviewer for this is.</p>
