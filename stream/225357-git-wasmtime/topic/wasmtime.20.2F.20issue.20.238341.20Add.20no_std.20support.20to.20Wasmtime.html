<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8341">issue #8341</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this issue I'd like to propose officially adding support for Rust's <code>#![no_std]</code> mode and crate attribute to the <code>wasmtime</code> crate and runtime. Notably, I'm proposing that we refute <a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-platform-support.html#what-about-no_std">current documentation about "why not <code>no_std</code>"</a>. This would additionally revert earlier work in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/554">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/554</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2024">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2024</a>.</p>
<p>Before I go into more depth, this is not a new issue to Wasmtime. This has been discussed in a number of places such as <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1158">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1158</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3451">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3451</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3495">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3495</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6424">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6424</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7700">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7700</a>, and I'm sure I'm missing others as well. I'll also point out that I was personally one of the ones previously advocating for specifically not supporting <code>no_std</code>, and my opinion has changed in the intervening years.</p>
<h3>Why support <code>no_std</code>?</h3>
<p>As far as I know the benefits of <code>no_std</code> haven't really ever been in question. After all, who doesn't want a project to be able to run in as many places as possible? To me I would personally rephrase this question as why to use <code>no_std</code> to support platform as opposed to alternative strategies. I'd answer this with the fact that <code>no_std</code> is the most idiomatic and well-supported solution in the Rust ecosystem. Rust developers in the embedded space are already used to <code>no_std</code> and what it entails. Additionally there are community idioms/expectations around the <code>no_std</code> feature to follow which set precedent.</p>
<h3>Why now?</h3>
<p>For a number of years now Wasmtime has had a page in its documentation for "What about <code>#[no_std]</code>?", so I think a fair question is why would we revert this and reconsider this previous decision at this point in time. The embedded space has become more interested in WebAssembly over time and there are a fair number of users today. The general feedback is that Wasmtime is not suitable in these environments, and one primary reason is that it's difficult to get Wasmtime working in these environments. Work such as <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7995">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7995</a> is to obscure for others to productively use as-is without being able to slot more idiomatically into the <code>no_std</code> ecosystem. More-or-less there's interest to use WebAssembly on platforms Wasmtime cannot easily target, and <code>no_std</code> support is intended to be a step towards making Wasmtime support on these platforms easier. </p>
<h3>Was the previous rationale wrong?</h3>
<p>In my opinion, the current documentation Wasmtime has for not supporting <code>no_std</code> is both right and wrong. Supporting <code>no_std</code> is not "free", it's something we'll have to maintain over time as a project and explicitly test in CI and consider for all new features. This cost wasn't necessarily justifiable earlier on in Wasmtime's development. Nowadays, though, Wasmtime has many more compile-time features and it's more clear what a <code>no_std</code> build of Wasmtime might look like. Supporting <code>no_std</code> is, however, idiomatic and the best way to support non-standard platforms in Rust. While it's theoretically possible to change how the standard library looks in upstream rust-lang/rust that's basically not happening any time soon.</p>
<h2>What does <code>no_std</code> for Wasmtime mean?</h2>
<p>With some of the more rationale-facing questions out of the way, I want to dive into some more details as to what <code>no_std</code> means for Wasmtime. If you read the title of this issue and say "wow finally it's about time Wasmtime had support" you're probably not going to be too interested in this section. This section is intended to outline what I learned from my experience of porting Wasmtime to <code>no_std</code>. I have two branches which ports the <code>wasmparser</code> crate to <code>no_std</code> as well as the <code>runtime</code> feature of the <code>wasmtime</code> crate:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-tools/tree/nostd">https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-tools/tree/nostd</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/tree/no-std">https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/tree/no-std</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Features of Wasmtime and <code>no_std</code></h3>
<p>Primarily the first part to mention is that I don't think we'll want to support every single feature of Wasmtime in the <code>no_std</code> configuration. Instead we'll want a few features explicitly listed as "this supports <code>no_std</code>" but everything else will implicitly enable a dependency on the <code>std</code> feature and the standard library. An example of this is that the <code>runtime</code> feature, the ability to execute WebAssembly modules, won't depend on std but the <code>cache</code> feature, which writes to a filesystem, would depend on the standard library. Notably, for the initial implementation, I'd also expect that <code>cranelift</code> itself would require the standard library. There's no inherent reason to do so, but that's how I wrote things originally.</p>
<h3>Usage of the <code>alloc</code> crate</h3>
<p>I also personally think it's worth clarifying that <code>no_std</code> for Wasmtime means <code>core</code> and <code>alloc</code> will be used. Notably this means that Wasmtime will still assume that all allocations succeed at all times and a failing allocation will cause a process abort and/or unrecoverable error. Wasmtime can't really feasibly be ported to an <code>alloc</code>-less build at this time, although if that's of interest to folks then it's something that might be worth investigating later on. I'm not sure how we'd support this in Wasmtime, though, so I'd prefer to defer such a question to a future issue. In the meantime the rest here will assume that <code>no_std</code> means that <code>alloc</code> can be used.</p>
<h3>Technical details of what support looks like to users</h3>
<p>To end users and consumers of Wasmtime what I'd propose is that the <code>wasmtime</code> crate will grow <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/wasmtime/Cargo.toml#L203">a compile-time Cargo feature called <code>std</code></a>. This feature is <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/wasmtime/Cargo.toml#L100">enabled by default</a> and is additionally enabled by any other feature which depends on standard library support, <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/wasmtime/Cargo.toml#L130">such as <code>cache</code></a>. If all of Wasmtime's features are disabled, however, then a small set of features, such as <code>runtime</code> and <code>component-model</code>, can be enabled without enabling the <code>std</code> feature of Wasmtime. This will prevent use of the <code>std</code> crate on some platforms.</p>
<p>The <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> crate will, by default, use the standard library on platforms that are known to have the standard library. For example on Linux the <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> crate <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/runtime/src/lib.rs#L7-L9">will continue to use <code>std</code> as necessary</a>. If <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> is compiled for an unknown platform, however, then the custom platform support added in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7995">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7995</a> will be enabled by default. This means that Wasmtime will not work out-of-the-box since <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/examples/min-platform/embedding/wasmtime-platform.h">this header file</a> will need to be implemented. This will be mentioned as part of Wasmtime's documentation and will be the escape hatch to enable embedders to implement custom logic to implement Wasmtime's runtime needs.</p>
<p>Put together, the general workflow for embedders using Wasmtime in <code>no_std</code> mode would look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage of <code>wasmtime</code> is audited to confirm that only <code>no_std</code>-compatible features of Wasmtime are used (e.g. not <code>cache</code>)</li>
<li>Wasmtime is compiled for a custom target that's not Linux, for example. This is then integrated as normal into other build systems as required.</li>
<li>Platform support for Wasmtime's runtime needs, such as mmap, the Rust <code>GlobalAlloc</code> trait, etc, must be provided by the embedder. For now this'll be a header file for Wasmtime's runtime needs and otherwise it's up to the embedder to fix compile errors about <code>GlobalAlloc</code> for example.</li>
</ul>
<p>My intent would be that we'd have at least one or two examples in the repository doing all this, like the current <code>min-platform</code> example.</p>
<h3>Technical details of what support looks like to Wasmtime developers</h3>
<p>To those who develop Wasmtime this issue is effectively asking more development cost to be taken on by the project. Despite having community norms and expectations the <code>no_std</code> development mode in Rust is not the standard development mode and may serve as a road bump to contributions and/or developers. Here I'd like to outline the specific issues I've found when porting Wasmtime to <code>no_std</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Imports <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/runtime/src/lib.rs#L17-L22">now come from <code>core</code> and <code>alloc</code></a>, not <code>std</code>. This is mostly a muscle memory thing to get over, but it's a downside in that only some parts of the project will do this. For example in <code>wasmtime-cache</code> we'll probably still have <code>use std::mem;</code> whereas in <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> that would be spelled <code>use core::mem;</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/prelude/index.html">prelude</a> is different for <code>#![no_std]</code> mode. Notably collections like <code>Vec</code> and <code>String</code> are not present. To work around this <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/environ/src/lib.rs#L15-L30">I've created a <code>mod prelude { ... }</code> in the <code>wasmtime-environ</code> crate</a> which is reexported at all other crate roots. Most modules in crate then have <code>use crate::prelude::*;</code> instead of individually importing common types like <code>String</code> and <code>Vec</code>.</li>
<li>Hash maps are different. The Rust standard library does not provide <code>HashMap</code> in the <code>alloc</code><br>

<p>The former consistently imports libcore and uses the libcore prelude, thus reducing the need for <code>#[cfg(feature = "std")]</code> elsewhere. Ot also makes rust-analyzer prefer importing from libcore over libstd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Carring over some thoughts from <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/1493#issuecomment-2051665206">this comment</a> I've looked more closely now at the hash map and seeding situation. As background the Rust standard library uses a DoS-resistant hashing algorithm which randomizes the seed for hashes for each thread. GIven <code>wasmparser</code>'s ubiquitous use of hash maps with user-supplied inputs (wasms) it seems prudent to retain this protection where possible.</p>
<p>What I would propose as a solution for now is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a <code>RandomState</code> structure to <code>wasmparser</code> which is used as the hasher for <code>IndexMap</code> and <code>hashbrown::HashMap</code>. This is an opaque structure and is used regardless of whether <code>feature = "std"</code> is enabled or not.</li>
<li>With <code>feature = "std"</code>, use <code>std::hash::RandomState</code> to implement <code>wasmparser::RandomState</code></li>
<li>Without <code>feature = "std"</code>, use <code>ahash::RandomState</code> to implement <code>wasmparser::RandomState</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The consequence of this is that when <code>std</code> is enabled we should have the exact same implementation/guarantees as today. This should cover "big" use cases such as FaaS which take lots of wasms. Without <code>std</code> the <code>ahash::RandomState</code> type uses the address of a constant as a seed input as well as a stack-based address. This relies on ASLR for security and isn't as strong as libstd's seeding. That being said there is <a href="https://docs.rs/ahash/latest/ahash/random_state/fn.set_random_source.html"><code>set_random_state</code></a> which can be used to provide a higher quality seed. I think this is probably less efficient than the creation of hash maps in the standard library but that shouldn't affect Wasmtime too much.</p>
<p>There's two drawbacks to this. First is that the <code>HashMap</code> types in the public API of <code>wasmtime</code> and <code>wasmparser</code> will not be the same as <code>hashbrown::HashMap</code> (or <code>IndexMap</code>) because of the use of a custom hasher. That's more common for <code>wasmparser</code> than <code>wasmtime</code> but it's hopefully not too onerous (type aliases will be provided in <code>wasmparser</code>). Second is that in no-std mode the hashing DoS guarantees will not be as strong and the performance of creating hash maps will not get as much scrutiny. With <code>ahash</code>-based seeding though that should help improve the DoS posture if necessary and performance can always be improved over time as necessary too.</p>

<p>Do you mean that the output of compilation and the execution of the resulting compiled wasm module needs to be deterministic? That should already be the case even with our current HashMap usage.

<p>I see. That only seems to be relevant to the wasmparser changes, and not the wasmtime changes as Wasmtime can't run in wasm anyway. It can compile wasm modules to machine code (<code>wasmtime compile</code>), but not run the resulting code.</p>

<p>Some users run Wasmi within Wasm (wasm32-unknown-unknown) executed via Wasmtime.</p>

<p>I see. That only seems to be relevant to the wasmparser changes, and not the wasmtime changes as Wasmtime can't run in wasm anyway. It can compile wasm modules to machine code (<code>wasmtime compile</code>), but not run the resulting code.</p>

<p>Yes that is correct. I should have said that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don't really have benchmarks one way or another, but at the same time I would be hesitant to replace all usage of all hash maps in Wasmtime with BTree maps because randomness/seeding may be hard to come by in some niche situations. Hash maps feel tailor made for most of what Wasmtime needs in various purposes, so if they're problematic I would imagine that a refactoring to remove the need for a map completely would be necessary. In that sense I would prefer to not use no_std support as a reason to change how data structures are done in Wasmtime, but instead consider it as motivation to refactor and rewrite preexisting algorithms to avoid types that are less suitable in a no_std context.</p>

<p>Okay that could work. We could use the <code>indexmap-nostd</code> implementation as basis. Its implementation focuses on simplicity and from my own experiences with Wasmi I never saw perf problems because of it.</p>

<p>@Robbepop sounds good! And also to make sure I clarify I don't plan on personally pursuing the BTreeMap approach of wasmparser, but I wanted to outline how I think it'd be reasonable to add so if you're up for making a PR once the no_std work starts landing I'd be happy to review.</p>
<p>@JonasKruckenberg oh nice! I think that PRs to add no_std to Cranelift after this work starts landing would indeed be welcome. I asked some folks at the Cranelift meeting yesterday and there were no objections and I suspect most won't object to this. One point brought up was that if Wasmtime is "doing the no_std thing" then it's pretty easy for Cranelift to do it as well as it'll just be an extension of what Wasmtime is already doing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Also, to clarify, I'm not sure precisely how best to have a "go no go" decision on this issue. My rough plan is to bring it up at the next Wasmtime meeting (a week from today) and assuming there are no objections start landing work at that point. My plan in landing the work is to do it piecemeal crate-by-crate so reviewers have an easier time seeing the impact as things progress.</p>

<p>@Robbepop sounds good! And also to make sure I clarify I don't plan on personally pursuing the BTreeMap approach of wasmparser, but I wanted to outline how I think it'd be reasonable to add so if you're up for making a PR once the no_std work starts landing I'd be happy to review.</p>

<p>@alexcrichton Yes, I'd be willing to file that PR once <code>no_std</code> support landed in the <code>wasmparser</code> crate. :)</p>
<p>I am already looking forward to the day I can finally put the <code>wasmparser-nostd</code> fork to rest.</p>

<p>For reference I pulled my <code>no_std</code> changes out of vendored folders and into a proper fork here: <a href="https://github.com/JonasKruckenberg/wasmtime/tree/no_std">https://github.com/JonasKruckenberg/wasmtime/tree/no_std</a>.<br>
I've changed <code>thiserror</code> to <code>onlyerror</code> (which implements <code>core::error::Error</code>) which in turn requires <code>error_in_core</code> for <code>no_std</code> builds. I'm personally fine with that (most <code>no_std</code> applications probably use nightly anyway) but I can also see the opposite and would be open to just disable the error implementation on <code>no_std</code> platforms like I've done across <code>cranelift-codegen</code> already</p>

<p>I'm a bit worried about the use of <code>spin::Once</code>. Spinlocks are terrible for throughput in case of contention as the spinning task/thread/... will starve the task/thread/... which would unlock the spinlock until the next preemption, which in case of a real time OS may never come if the thread waiting for the lock has a higher priority than the thread which locked it. I believe the critical-section crate is frequently used for locks in a way that allows the user to specify how locks should actually be implemented internally. Looks like it doesn't have a ready made <code>Once</code> implementation though. How hard would it be to make it possible to create the MachineEnv's in a const fn such that no runtime initialization is needed?</p>

<p>alexcrichton closed <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8341">issue #8341</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this issue I'd like to propose officially adding support for Rust's <code>#![no_std]</code> mode and crate attribute to the <code>wasmtime</code> crate and runtime. Notably, I'm proposing that we refute <a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-platform-support.html#what-about-no_std">current documentation about "why not <code>no_std</code>"</a>. This would additionally revert earlier work in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/554">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/554</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2024">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2024</a>.</p>
<p>Before I go into more depth, this is not a new issue to Wasmtime. This has been discussed in a number of places such as <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1158">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1158</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3451">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3451</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3495">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3495</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6424">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6424</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7700">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7700</a>, and I'm sure I'm missing others as well. I'll also point out that I was personally one of the ones previously advocating for specifically not supporting <code>no_std</code>, and my opinion has changed in the intervening years.</p>
<h3>Why support <code>no_std</code>?</h3>
<p>As far as I know the benefits of <code>no_std</code> haven't really ever been in question. After all, who doesn't want a project to be able to run in as many places as possible? To me I would personally rephrase this question as why to use <code>no_std</code> to support platform as opposed to alternative strategies. I'd answer this with the fact that <code>no_std</code> is the most idiomatic and well-supported solution in the Rust ecosystem. Rust developers in the embedded space are already used to <code>no_std</code> and what it entails. Additionally there are community idioms/expectations around the <code>no_std</code> feature to follow which set precedent.</p>
<h3>Why now?</h3>
<p>For a number of years now Wasmtime has had a page in its documentation for "What about <code>#[no_std]</code>?", so I think a fair question is why would we revert this and reconsider this previous decision at this point in time. The embedded space has become more interested in WebAssembly over time and there are a fair number of users today. The general feedback is that Wasmtime is not suitable in these environments, and one primary reason is that it's difficult to get Wasmtime working in these environments. Work such as <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7995">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7995</a> is to obscure for others to productively use as-is without being able to slot more idiomatically into the <code>no_std</code> ecosystem. More-or-less there's interest to use WebAssembly on platforms Wasmtime cannot easily target, and <code>no_std</code> support is intended to be a step towards making Wasmtime support on these platforms easier. </p>
<h3>Was the previous rationale wrong?</h3>
<p>In my opinion, the current documentation Wasmtime has for not supporting <code>no_std</code> is both right and wrong. Supporting <code>no_std</code> is not "free", it's something we'll have to maintain over time as a project and explicitly test in CI and consider for all new features. This cost wasn't necessarily justifiable earlier on in Wasmtime's development. Nowadays, though, Wasmtime has many more compile-time features and it's more clear what a <code>no_std</code> build of Wasmtime might look like. Supporting <code>no_std</code> is, however, idiomatic and the best way to support non-standard platforms in Rust. While it's theoretically possible to change how the standard library looks in upstream rust-lang/rust that's basically not happening any time soon.</p>
<h2>What does <code>no_std</code> for Wasmtime mean?</h2>
<p>With some of the more rationale-facing questions out of the way, I want to dive into some more details as to what <code>no_std</code> means for Wasmtime. If you read the title of this issue and say "wow finally it's about time Wasmtime had support" you're probably not going to be too interested in this section. This section is intended to outline what I learned from my experience of porting Wasmtime to <code>no_std</code>. I have two branches which ports the <code>wasmparser</code> crate to <code>no_std</code> as well as the <code>runtime</code> feature of the <code>wasmtime</code> crate:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-tools/tree/nostd">https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-tools/tree/nostd</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/tree/no-std">https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/tree/no-std</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Features of Wasmtime and <code>no_std</code></h3>
<p>Primarily the first part to mention is that I don't think we'll want to support every single feature of Wasmtime in the <code>no_std</code> configuration. Instead we'll want a few features explicitly listed as "this supports <code>no_std</code>" but everything else will implicitly enable a dependency on the <code>std</code> feature and the standard library. An example of this is that the <code>runtime</code> feature, the ability to execute WebAssembly modules, won't depend on std but the <code>cache</code> feature, which writes to a filesystem, would depend on the standard library. Notably, for the initial implementation, I'd also expect that <code>cranelift</code> itself would require the standard library. There's no inherent reason to do so, but that's how I wrote things originally.</p>
<h3>Usage of the <code>alloc</code> crate</h3>
<p>I also personally think it's worth clarifying that <code>no_std</code> for Wasmtime means <code>core</code> and <code>alloc</code> will be used. Notably this means that Wasmtime will still assume that all allocations succeed at all times and a failing allocation will cause a process abort and/or unrecoverable error. Wasmtime can't really feasibly be ported to an <code>alloc</code>-less build at this time, although if that's of interest to folks then it's something that might be worth investigating later on. I'm not sure how we'd support this in Wasmtime, though, so I'd prefer to defer such a question to a future issue. In the meantime the rest here will assume that <code>no_std</code> means that <code>alloc</code> can be used.</p>
<h3>Technical details of what support looks like to users</h3>
<p>To end users and consumers of Wasmtime what I'd propose is that the <code>wasmtime</code> crate will grow <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/wasmtime/Cargo.toml#L203">a compile-time Cargo feature called <code>std</code></a>. This feature is <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/wasmtime/Cargo.toml#L100">enabled by default</a> and is additionally enabled by any other feature which depends on standard library support, <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/wasmtime/Cargo.toml#L130">such as <code>cache</code></a>. If all of Wasmtime's features are disabled, however, then a small set of features, such as <code>runtime</code> and <code>component-model</code>, can be enabled without enabling the <code>std</code> feature of Wasmtime. This will prevent use of the <code>std</code> crate on some platforms.</p>
<p>The <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> crate will, by default, use the standard library on platforms that are known to have the standard library. For example on Linux the <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> crate <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/runtime/src/lib.rs#L7-L9">will continue to use <code>std</code> as necessary</a>. If <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> is compiled for an unknown platform, however, then the custom platform support added in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7995">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7995</a> will be enabled by default. This means that Wasmtime will not work out-of-the-box since <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/examples/min-platform/embedding/wasmtime-platform.h">this header file</a> will need to be implemented. This will be mentioned as part of Wasmtime's documentation and will be the escape hatch to enable embedders to implement custom logic to implement Wasmtime's runtime needs.</p>
<p>Put together, the general workflow for embedders using Wasmtime in <code>no_std</code> mode would look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage of <code>wasmtime</code> is audited to confirm that only <code>no_std</code>-compatible features of Wasmtime are used (e.g. not <code>cache</code>)</li>
<li>Wasmtime is compiled for a custom target that's not Linux, for example. This is then integrated as normal into other build systems as required.</li>
<li>Platform support for Wasmtime's runtime needs, such as mmap, the Rust <code>GlobalAlloc</code> trait, etc, must be provided by the embedder. For now this'll be a header file for Wasmtime's runtime needs and otherwise it's up to the embedder to fix compile errors about <code>GlobalAlloc</code> for example.</li>
</ul>
<p>My intent would be that we'd have at least one or two examples in the repository doing all this, like the current <code>min-platform</code> example.</p>
<h3>Technical details of what support looks like to Wasmtime developers</h3>
<p>To those who develop Wasmtime this issue is effectively asking more development cost to be taken on by the project. Despite having community norms and expectations the <code>no_std</code> development mode in Rust is not the standard development mode and may serve as a road bump to contributions and/or developers. Here I'd like to outline the specific issues I've found when porting Wasmtime to <code>no_std</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Imports <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/runtime/src/lib.rs#L17-L22">now come from <code>core</code> and <code>alloc</code></a>, not <code>std</code>. This is mostly a muscle memory thing to get over, but it's a downside in that only some parts of the project will do this. For example in <code>wasmtime-cache</code> we'll probably still have <code>use std::mem;</code> whereas in <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> that would be spelled <code>use core::mem;</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/prelude/index.html">prelude</a> is different for <code>#![no_std]</code> mode. Notably collections like <code>Vec</code> and <code>String</code> are not present. To work around this <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/blob/aa633ced871cfdadc959b3455c179d56e21007bb/crates/environ/src/lib.rs#L15-L30">I've created a <code>mod prelude { ... }</code> in the <code>wasmtime-environ</code> crate</a> which is reexported at all other crate roots. Most modules in crate then have <code>use crate::prelude::*;</code> instead of individually importing common types like <code>String</code> and <code>Vec</code>.</li>
<li>Hash maps are different. The Rust standard library does not provide <code>HashMap</code> in the <code>alloc</code><br>
[message truncated]</li>
</ol>
