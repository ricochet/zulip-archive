<blockquote>
<p>I was thinking about support for multiple WASM instances in the same host process. But ran into a problem with functions like <code>wasi_unstable!proc_exit</code> which are meant to kill the process rather than returning to the main entry function. Killing the process would not be desired in this case. A general use-case would be if a fork() feature was added which make use of the same host process to spawn copies of the running WASM instance - but when terminating an instance - it should then not impact the remaining instances. I'm looking for just running 'fully' independent instances in the same process for now, though.</p>
<p>But to make it possible to run multiple WASM instances - we really need a way to force a return to the instance entry function caller - and ensure the native function stack - but NOT the WASM stack - gets cleaned up. So I think we need a way to create a special termination/not-catchable trap - that just triggers jumps to the next native function call on the stack - but skipping any WASM frames for clean up. The new trap type ensures that WASM cannot recover from the termination request.</p>
<p>This does involve WASM exception handling and WASM C-lib. But I'll start here to see if this would be viable to solve for wasmtime.</p>
