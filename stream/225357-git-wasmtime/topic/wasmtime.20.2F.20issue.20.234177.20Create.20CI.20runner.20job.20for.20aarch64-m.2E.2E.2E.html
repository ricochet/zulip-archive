<p>We've discussed this in various places (most recently #3982) but we don't seem to have an open issue tracking the eventual addition of an actual CI job for aarch64-macos ("M1" / "Apple Silicon").</p>
<p>It looks like GitHub is perhaps making slow progress toward having runners: see <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/805">actions/runner#805</a> where just today, a GitHub PM indicated that next week there will be a pre-release of a self-hosted M1 runner. Now, we likely want to wait until there are GitHub runners, as there are serious security concerns with self-hosted ones; but this is progress.</p>
<p>The relevant issue for GitHub-hosted VM runners seems to be <a href="https://github.com/virtual-environments/issues/issues/2187">virtual-environments/issues#2187</a>.</p>
