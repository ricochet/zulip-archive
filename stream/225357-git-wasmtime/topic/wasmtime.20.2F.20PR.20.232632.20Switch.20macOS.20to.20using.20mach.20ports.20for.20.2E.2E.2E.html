<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2632">PR #2632</a> from <code>mach-ports</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit moves macOS to using mach ports instead of signals for<br>
handling traps. The motivation for this is listed in #2456, namely that<br>
once mach ports are used in a process that means traditional UNIX signal<br>
handlers won't get used. This means that if Wasmtime is integrated with<br>
Breakpad, for example, then Wasmtime's trap handler never fires and<br>
traps don't work.</p>
<p>The <code>traphandlers</code> module is refactored as part of this commit to split<br>
the platform-specific bits into their own files (it was growing quite a<br>
lot for one inline <code>cfg_if!</code>). The <code>unix.rs</code> and <code>windows.rs</code> files<br>
remain the same as they were before with a few minor tweaks for some<br>
refactored interfaces. The <code>macos.rs</code> file is brand new and lifts almost<br>
its entire implementation from SpiderMonkey, adapted for Wasmtime<br>
though.</p>
<p>The main gotcha with mach ports is that a separate thread is what<br>
services the exception. Some unsafe magic allows this separate thread to<br>
read non-<code>Send</code> and temporary state from other threads, but is hoped to<br>
be safe in this context. The unfortunate downside is that calling wasm<br>
on macOS now involves taking a global lock and modifying a global hash<br>
map twice-per-call. I'm not entirely sure how to get out of this cost<br>
for now, but hopefully for any embeddings on macOS it's not the end of<br>
the world.</p>
<p>Closes #2456</p>
