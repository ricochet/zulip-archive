</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this could be nice! If the flags don't have any relationship with each other, it might be possible to pass a <code>&amp;sink</code> to the <code>new()</code> function and encode it as we call the builder functions. Alternatively, deferring it all and building in <code>encode(&amp;sink)</code> sounds good too! And if this works out well, we could refactor a bit the previous encode functions; their API really looks a bit too C-ish.</p>

I cannot just add a boolean evex field to XmmUnaryRmR because some AVX512 instructions (e.g. VPABSQ) don't exist so they should not be included in SseOpcode.

</blockquote>
<p>Why wouldn't this scale well, out of curiosity? In general I think we should tend to APIs that make it impossible to create invalid instructions. It might not be the case for existing APIs, which should be refactored ideally...</p>

<p>@bnjbvr, the latest commit moves to the builder pattern. It's a hybrid of your idea: the EVEX 4-byte prefix is built up as the builder methods are called but we still need to call <code>.encode(sink)</code> to emit later because some methods, e.g. <code>.reg(...)</code>, modify both the prefix and the ModR/M byte, which are emitted at completely different times.</p>
<p>Being a bit paranoid about performance, I benchmarked the <code>encode_evex</code> function approach and the current <code>EvexInstruction</code> builder approach by encoding the same instruction repeatedly inside bencher. For some reason, the builder approach turns out to be faster:</p>

<p>I didn't dig too deep into this since @cfallin mentioned that emission is hardly the long pole in the tent. I was happy enough that this builder approach was not slower and left it at that.

<p>I mean mental scaling, not codegen performance or anything like that (some of us operate on limited brain RAM). Finding the right <code>Inst</code> variant when adding a new instruction can be tricky: "so this is unary, right, so I'm going to use that... no wait, I need to use the Xmm form... no, hold on, this is AVX512 so I need to find the Evex form of that." It's a developer experience thing more than anything. I agree that we should restrict the inputs somehow to only generate valid instructions but this "which Inst variant?" question seems a bit different.</p>
