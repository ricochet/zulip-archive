<p>uweigand opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2492">PR #2492</a> from <code>endian-memory-v5</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly memory operations are by definition little-endian even on<br>
big-endian target platforms.  However, other memory accesses will require<br>
native target endianness (e.g. to access parts of the VMContext that is<br>
also accessed by VM native code).  This means on big-endian targets,<br>
the code generator will have to handle both little- and big-endian<br>
memory accesses.  However, there is currently no way to encode that<br>
distinction into the Cranelift IR that describes memory accesses.</p>
<p>This patch provides such a way by adding an (optional) explicit<br>
endianness marker to an instance of MemFlags.  Since each Cranelift IR<br>
instruction that describes memory accesses already has an instance of<br>
MemFlags attached, this can now be used to provide endianness<br>
information.</p>
<p>Note that by default, memory accesses will continue to use the native<br>
target ISA endianness.  To override this to specify an explicit<br>
endianness, a MemFlags value that was built using the set_endianness<br>
routine must be used.  This patch does so for accesses that implement<br>
WebAssembly memory operations.</p>
<p>This patch addresses issue #2124.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Add to comment here that if no endianness is specified, then the native endianness is returned? We might also include a small note about why we have this native-endian option: it allows code generators to produce performant CLIF without requiring access to the target machine's endianness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Outdated comment, I think?</p>
<p>To the point about endianness at construction: perhaps we could have, still, a separate constructor (used just where explicit, possibly non-native, endianness is needed, e.g. in the Wasm translator). I don't think that ensuring their immutability is a huge concern though: adding other flags can also break program semantics (e.g., promising a value is "readonly" when it's not might break optimizations relying on alias analysis), so I don't think we have to worry too much about distinguishing endianness flags (other than ensuring they're mutually exclusive, as you've done).</p>
