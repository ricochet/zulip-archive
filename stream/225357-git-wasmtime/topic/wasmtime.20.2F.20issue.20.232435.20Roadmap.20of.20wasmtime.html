<blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty old issue at this point so I'm going to close this. In general this is mostly a topic for the bytecodealliance at large and the RFCs repository as well. At this time I do not believe there is an official roadmap for Wasmtime itself, and adding one is best done through an RFC rather than an issue here.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Adding a roadmap of wasmtime.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>I think most of the users and yet-to-be users would be interested in seeing what is the future of the project. Similarly, a roadmap could potentially reveal if the project is focused on achieving some specific major goals, such as specific platform support. Moreover, a clear list, for example, for a release could attract more contributors as it would be clear what needs to be done.</p>
<p>At the present moment, it is certainly vague what needs to be improved (besides checking issues), what new features could be developed (besides new proposals) and what are the overall goals.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>It could be added as a new document to the existing <code>docs</code> folder.<br>
