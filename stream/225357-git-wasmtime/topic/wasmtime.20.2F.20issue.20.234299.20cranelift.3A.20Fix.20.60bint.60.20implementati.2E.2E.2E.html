<blockquote>
<p>The <code>bint</code> instruction returns 0 or 1. The <code>bmask</code> instruction returns all zeros or all ones. #3205 is about the actual representation in registers and memory, not about the result of <code>bint</code>/<code>bmask</code>, right?</p>

<p>No, that issue I think is mostly related to the trampoline generating the wrong code when loading / storing booleans, and its why I had to do duplicate some code in this PR in order to not have boolean arguments to the test cases.</p>

<p>Yes, primarily it is about representations, but @cfallin mentions <code>bint</code> in the description and I bring up an <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3205#issuecomment-901478585">all ones/all zeroes comment</a> ater. The main reason for me mentioning it here is that I want GitHub to keep track of all the cross-links between related issues (and semi-related issues, in this case) so that it is easier to investigate later.</p>
