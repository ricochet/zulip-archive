<blockquote>
<p>Currently, Wasmtime uses explicit stack-limit checks to avoid overflowing the stack, and these checks are generated in the prologue of every Wasm function. This is largely a consequence of the design decision to run on the host's stack (when not doing async): the two subcases are either Wasm hits the guard page itself (and we don't currently have a mechanism to recover from that, with a separate signal stack) or Wasm uses almost all the stack then calls back into the host and the host then overflows (which looks like a host crash). So the advantage of explicit stack-limit checks is that they retain control while giving us a well-defined path to return a trap, but the cost is that they impose overhead on every function call. (And potentially nontrivial overhead: the limit is several chained loads deep in data structures.)</p>
<p>The alternative idea is to switch to reliance on a guard page, with stack probes in functions that have frames larger than a single guard page (just as with native code today), and handle the two cases above by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing a sigaltstack and handling a trap in the function prologue as a stack-overflow Wasm trap;</li>
<li>Explicitly checking against the stack limit on exit from the Wasm code back to host code.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Not coincidentally, I believe this is also the exact scheme that was used by Lucet!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some other bits I've thought of after more thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's one more way to exit wasm which isn't via trampolines, and that's via libcalls. Here there's two kinds of libcalls:<ul>
<li>One kind of libcall is cranelift-inserted and is for things like <code>fma</code> when the architecture doesn't have fma. (also things like <code>ceil</code> without sse4.2). These relocations are resolved <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/c44783347b398019d67b61e9d360012387ce7906/crates/wasmtime/src/runtime/code_memory.rs#L295">here</a> and we'd have to install custom versions of all libcalls that do stack checks before calling the native function. AFAIK we don't have the option to rely on cranelift-generated trampolines here.</li>
<li>Another kind of libcall is Wasmtime's libcalls for <code>memory.grow</code> and the like. We'll need to <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/c44783347b398019d67b61e9d360012387ce7906/crates/runtime/src/arch/x86_64.rs#L63-L84">modify these macros</a> to handle the stack check too. Ideally though we'd rely on cranelift-generated trampolines here somehow, but that would be a refactoring we don't currently have in place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One nice property today is that when we have a segfault we are able to validate that there is cranelift metadata claiming "yes this instruction can segfault". We go so far as to say a pc is only a wasm pc if it <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/c44783347b398019d67b61e9d360012387ce7906/crates/wasmtime/src/runtime/module/registry.rs#L277">has a trap registered for it</a>. This is a nice defense-in-depth thing for catching bugs where we don't accidentally handle faults from instructions that shouldn't actually fault. Historically we handled this by assuming any faulting instruction was a stack overflow fault if it didn't have a trap pc, but I'd prefer to not go back to that. Instead I think what we can do is that we can attach stack overflow metadata for any explicit probes to handle &gt;1page stacks. For &lt;1page stacks we can test that the faulting address is within 1 page of the stack pointer, and in that case assume that it's stack overflow</li>
<li>We'll need to sigaltstack for more than SIGSEGV but also SIGILL because wasm could be close to a stack overflow and then have a divide-by-zero for example.</li>
<li>I'll note that we do not do sigsetjmp/siglongjmp today. We <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/c44783347b398019d67b61e9d360012387ce7906/crates/runtime/src/helpers.c#L34-L38">try to instead use architecture-specific intrinsics</a> which are more efficient than sigsetjmp/siglongjmp. I think that's ok for this use case, but it something to watch out for.</li>
<li>I'm remembering now <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2676">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2676</a> which I recall was a complicated interaction when embedding Wasmtime. This reminds me that on macOS when we catch a trap we actually <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/c44783347b398019d67b61e9d360012387ce7906/crates/runtime/src/sys/unix/signals.rs#L164-L165">resume execution outside the context of the signal handler</a> and then it resumes inside of <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/c44783347b398019d67b61e9d360012387ce7906/crates/runtime/src/sys/unix/signals.rs#L162"><code>wasmtime_longjmp</code></a>. We'll probably need to unwind at least 4k or so and just pave over whatever's there since the very end of the stack probably isn't usable.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for filling in a ton of details here! A few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libcalls: given that Cranelift has mechanisms today to generate the stack-limit check in prologues, it seems we could have a mode where it is aware that libcalls are "special" (host escapes) and it can generate the same limit-checking just before a given libcall. Not terribly efficient but we mostly use libcalls to polyfill float stuff on older (non-SSE 4.2 or whatever) machines so maybe that's OK.</li>
<li>Calls to Wasmtime helpers: we could perhaps encapsulate the above logic in a new CLIF instruction, <code>check_stack_limit</code> or somesuch, and emit that before a call to any helper in our environment implementation.</li>
<li>Trap-info precision: we could have a notion of range in addition to exact PC, and cover the whole prologue (which may have multiple stack pushes, etc) with a stack-overflow trap region. We would need to be a little careful to ensure that our whole frame is "probed" implicitly in the prologue wrt its layout and store order: currently user-defined stackslots and spillslots come below clobber-saves and the FP/return address pair, and we only store the latter, so maybe we want to either flip that (though Windows fastcall forced this arrangement IIRC) or have one phantom store to the lowest stack/spillslot in the prologue. We'd also need to adjust the scheme for stack-args at callsites: currently on x64, aarch64 and riscv64 we decrement SP further, whereas we'd want to preallocate the maximum call-arg size in the prologue as s390x does.</li>
</ul>

<p>where if the first <code>or</code> faults then the faulting address is pretty far away from <code>rsp</code>, perhaps many pages. That I think can be solved though with explicit trap metadata per probe.</p>
<p>I suppose put another way, I'd like to ideally frame the problem as:</p>
<p>All stack overflows caught through the guard page can either be classified as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The faulting address is within one page of the stack pointer itself</li>
<li>The instruction is annotated as "this may cause stack overflow"</li>

The comment there cites Valgrind compatibility, which I think specifically means that rsp is decremented first; I don't know if there's a reason we do individual decrements per store on x86, though on aarch64/riscv64 it would allow us to use store-with-immediate-offset insts with small offset fields. In any case, we do seem to already have this "fault is close to actual current SP" property already, which is nice!</p>

<p>Oh nice, so then if we're comfortable saying all faults within 1 page of rsp are stack-overflow related faults, I think all we need to do is turn on stack probes and call it a day then?</p>

<p>I poked a bit more at this, specifically with respect to cranelift-injected libcalls (e.g. <code>ceilf</code>). These are not as simple as wasmtime builtins because they don't take a <code>*mut VMContext</code> argument (which I forgot about). The best way I could think of for implementing this was:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, call a "consume stack" builtin whose sole purpose is to have a big stack frame and probe that there's ~32k of stack remaining.</li>
<li>Next call a "stack limit" libcall where Wasmtime uses its thread-local state to read the stack limit field of <code>VMRuntimeLimits</code></li>
<li>Finally perform an explicit stack check with this, and then assuming that proceeds call the actual libcall.</li>
</ul>
<p>I got all that wired up and working and AFAIK that covers the cases that at least I could think of where the guard page will now guaranteed be hit in Cranelift-generated code.</p>
<hr>
<p>Stepping back a bit though, I thought a little more about this at a higher level. I ran sightglass's default suite and it showed a 3-4% improvement in execution on spidermonkey.wasm, but no changes elsewhere. I'm not sure if it would show a larger improvement in the situations that you're looking at @cfallin though if they're call-heavy benchmarks.</p>
<p>I'm a bit worried about the complexity of this change. Lots about Cranelift/Wasmtime are striking the right balance between simplicity and performance, and I don't think there's any silver bullet for handling stack overflow in wasm. The stack limit check is quite simple but not exactly speedy. Using a guard page feels pretty complex and subtle because we need a guarantee that only Cranelift-generated code hits the guard page, never native code. I've done my best to enumerate all the possible ways that I personally know of we need to handle but I have little confidence that my knowledge is exhaustive, for example I haven't analyzed components yet to see if they need updates too.</p>
<p>More-or-less I think we should probably have more compelling performance data motivating this change before pursuing it further. If 3-4% breaks the bank then that seems ok to pursue, but in abstract 3-4% feels pretty small and perhaps not worth the complexity. If there's a 40% improvement in a different benchmark though that's of course more compelling.</p>

<p>@alexcrichton thanks a bunch for pushing this further! I agree it's best to do this only if it actually matters. In my own work I can at least test your branch if it's available, once I get ICs (lots of tiny function calls) wired up properly, and give more data; it'd have to be worth 1.5x-2x or so in my mind.</p>
