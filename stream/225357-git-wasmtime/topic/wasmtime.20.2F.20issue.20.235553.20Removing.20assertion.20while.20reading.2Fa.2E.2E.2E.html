<p>@alexcrichton and @fitzgen, do either of you have opinions on this suggestion?</p>
<p>If you can spare some more time to investigate this bug, I'd be happier if we better understood its cause.</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at <code>process_label</code>, I see that it's <code>FunctionFrameInfo::value_ranges</code> which has an invalid range for some label.</li>
<li>As far as I can tell, the values in that map are only set by <code>get_function_frame_info</code>.</li>
<li>That comes from <code>CompiledFunction::value_labels_ranges</code> in the wasmtime-cranelift crate.</li>
<li>That comes from <code>CompiledCodeBase::value_labels_ranges</code> in the cranelift-codegen crate.</li>
<li>That comes from target-specific code implementing <code>TargetIsa::compile_function</code>.</li>
<li>Every backend implements that by calling <code>VCode::emit</code> and getting the <code>EmitResult::value_labels_ranges</code> field.</li>
<li>That's computed by <code>VCode::compute_value_labels_ranges</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At that point there's a somewhat complex interaction between the <code>inst_offsets</code> array constructed in cranelift-codegen and the <code>debug_locations</code> array constructed by regalloc2.</p>
<p>I think a good first troubleshooting step would be to assert that <code>from_offset &lt; to_offset</code> before pushing a new <code>ValueLocRange</code> in <code>VCode::compute_value_labels_ranges</code>. Hopefully that assert fails instead of the assert in <code>process_label</code>; otherwise we'd need to investigate more to understand where these ranges are coming from.</p>
<p>Then we could check why these ranges are out of order. I think the only possibilities are either that <code>regalloc.debug_locations</code> has pairs that are out of order, or <code>inst_offsets</code> is out of order. If it's the former then we can switch to investigating regalloc2; otherwise we can look at <code>VCode::emit</code>.</p>
<p>Either way we'd know more than we know now and be closer to fixing this particular bug.</p>

<p>I am generally very suspicious of sweeping-the-bugs-under-the-rug kind of thing. If it was a bug that was purely within the DWARF transform, then I would be more amenable to it since that code as-is has no future and needs a rewrite, but since it looks like this is bottoming out in Cranelift, I think it would be better to debug the Cranelift issue like you laid out.</p>

<p>The dwarf parser in chrome doesn't fail on it.</p>
<p>Speculations (I know little about all this yet):<br>
Maybe if we add assert earlier in the wasmtime pipeline, to validate input dwarf, we could learn that the flipped start/end is in the input by LLVM ?<br>
And maybe it's how it should be, for break, which is a jmp to label, but in wasm it's some nested block for some reason ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The dwarf parser in chrome doesn't fail on it.</p>
<p>Speculations (I know little about all this yet): Maybe if we add assert earlier in the wasmtime pipeline, to validate input dwarf, we could learn that the flipped start/end is in the input by LLVM ? And maybe it's how it should be, for break, which is a jmp to label, but in wasm it's some nested block for some reason ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds possible to me but, like you, I know little about all of this.</p>
<p>I think it's unlikely, if I'm reading the Wasmtime/Cranelift source correctly. I think the point of the <code>process_label</code> function is to combine Cranelift's data with the input DWARF from LLVM, but I think this assert is only looking at data that was generated by Cranelift and regalloc2, not from the input DWARF. So I think it's most likely that this is detecting a bug in Cranelift or regalloc2.</p>

<p>Same here, removing the assertion did not fix the problem, but changing the if statement above to continue if <code>range_start</code> is greater than range_end` (not just when it is equal) did fix it and I am able to finally debug my Wasm module. Given that this bug is severe and that developers have complained about it for a long time, and that no one knows the cause making this bug difficult to fix for a long time, I think that it should be "swept-under-the-rug" ASAP. Then the root cause for the bug can be fixed later. At least this is better than debugging Wasm modules not being possible.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that can make it impossible to single step at several places and will cause incorrect assignments from machine instructions to source lines.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I was able to both single step and set breakpoints, and I didn't observe any strange instruction to source line assignments. Now I know absolutely nothing about dwarf, and I'm sure you're right that there will be bugs. But from my perspective an unstable debugger is better than no debugger at all. At least for the time being.</p>
