<blockquote>
<p>Hi .. I'd like to ask for input on JIT profiling support of wasmtime ... specifically the gaps that exists, current code that should be leveraged, and a good implementation direction for sharing code paths. Personally, I would like to see support in both perf and vtune. Currently there do not appear to be any wasmtime patches that specifically targeting profiling support, but there are patches scattered in related projects that may be leveraged in support of such an effort. Specifically @yurydelendik has some patches as discussed here wasmtime/pull/53 that potentially may be levered to help create a mapping information that can be used either by vtune directly or by vtune and perf indirectly. Also, there is the perf map support here cranelift/pull/571 which I hope to try soon. </p>
<p>I have started implementing support for a hook for vtune for at least seeing the jitted assembly, and I will continue that soon focusing on getting proper mappings. I think for perf support it may make sense to start with a generating a simple map file and developing instructions for leveraging that. Ultimately though, I'd hope it would be possible to share as much code as possible as part of a comprehensive solution for that covers both profiling tools.</p>
