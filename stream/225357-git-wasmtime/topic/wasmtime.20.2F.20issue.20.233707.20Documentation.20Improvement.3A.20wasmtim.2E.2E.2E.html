<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime"><code>wasmtime</code> crate</a> has a fairly sparse readme, especially when compared to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmer"><code>wasmer</code></a>.</p>
<p>Most of the specific features I would suggest can be found on the aforementioned wasmer crate readme.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use links for anything that has an associated page (e.g. on "<code>wasmtime</code> Webassembly runtime")</li>
<li>Offer a "usage" section with an example and links to where you can find more.</li>
<li>Offer a "features" section that describes any high-level features of the crate.</li>
<li>Add at least CI, <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a> version, and license badges.</li>
</ol>
<p>While a bit more nebulous, the <code>wasmer</code> crate also has a much warmer feeling to it and makes a lot of appeals to users like</p>
<ul>
<li>mentioning that it is "the most popular WebAssembly runtime",</li>
<li>emphasizing that "It's designed to be safe and secure, and runnable in any kind of environment",</li>
<li>saying that wasmer is "Made with <span aria-label="heart" class="emoji emoji-2764" role="img" title="heart">:heart:</span>️ by the Wasmer team, for the community".</li>
</ul>
<p>While it doesn't make sense for wasmtime to try to match these various appeals 1-to-1, it might make sense to think about what messages about wasmtime the crates page should try to convey to users about the tool, it's properties, and it's creators. One appeal that might make sense is to refer to wasmtime's status as part of the Bytecode Alliance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently noticed that the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wat/1.0.41"><code>wat</code> crate</a>, and a number of other <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates">wasm-tools crates</a>, actually do the sorts of things I'm suggesting. It might make sense to extract out the structure of the more refined READMEs into a template for Bytecode Alliance crates.</p>
