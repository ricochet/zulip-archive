<p>While trying to update lucet to the most recent cranelift, I ran into some issues that stemmed from <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1209" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1209">bytecodealliance/cranelift#1209</a> changing the semantics of what zero-initialized data did.  Previously, zero-initialized data was essentially just like normal data, except that cranelift-module took care of generating the initial vector of zeros to modify.  After that PR, zero-initialized data now had special semantics of not actually existing in the generated object, but living in <code>.bss</code> (or similar) and being zero-initialized by the runtime loader.</p>
<p>This was an excellent change!  However, <code>lucetc</code> depended on the old behavior, in particular the application of relocations to the declared data.  I think <code>lucetc</code>'s behavior is wrong, and I intend to write up a PR for that.</p>
<p>I don't think relocations (<code>declare_func_in_data</code>, etc.) should actually apply to zero-initialized data...but cranelift-module happily lets you declare zero-initialized data and also declare that there should be various relocations applied to said data, which I don't think is going to translate well.  (If it is supposed to translate well, faerie, at least, currently has bugs in that area.)</p>

<p>Yeah, <code>cranelift-object</code> won't handle this correctly either. If it had to, the best it could do is choose which section based on the number of relocs (similiar to what <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/4a443e4f10f520cdd88f49fa96d180a5d28d6b54/cranelift/object/src/backend.rs#L312" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/4a443e4f10f520cdd88f49fa96d180a5d28d6b54/cranelift/object/src/backend.rs#L312">read only data does</a>). But I don't see a problem with disallowing these relocations in <code>cranelift-module</code>.</p>
