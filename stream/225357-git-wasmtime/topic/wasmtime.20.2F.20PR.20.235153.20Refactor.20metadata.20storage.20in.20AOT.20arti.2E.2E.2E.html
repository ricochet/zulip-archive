<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5153">PR #5153</a> from <code>refactor-compilation-metadata</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit is a reorganization of how metadata is stored in Wasmtime's compiled artifacts. Currently Wasmtime's ELF artifacts have data appended after them to contain metadata about the <code>Engine</code> as well as type information for the module itself. This extra data at the end of the file is ignored by ELF-related utilities generally and is assembled during the module serialization process.</p>
<p>In working on AOT-compiling components, though, I've discovered a number of issues with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Primarily it's possible to mistakenly change an artifact if it's deserialized and then serialized again. This issue is probably theoretical but the deserialized artifact records the <code>Engine</code> configuration at time of creation but when re-serializing that it serializes the current <code>Engine</code> state, not the original <code>Engine</code> state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally the serialization strategy here is tightly coupled to <code>Module</code> and its serialization format. While this makes sense it is not conducive for future refactorings to use a similar serialization format for components. The engine metadata, for example, does not necessarily need to be tied up with type information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The storage for this extra metadata is a bit wonky by shoving it at the end of the ELF file. The original reason for this was to have a compiled artifact be multiple objects concatenated with each other to support serializing module-linking-using modules. Module linking is no longer a thing and I have since decided that for the component model all compilation artifacts will go into one object file to assist debugability. This means that the extra stick-it-at-the-end is no longer necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve these issues this commit splits up the<br>
<code>module/serialization.rs</code> file in two, mostly moving the logic to <code>engine/serialization.rs</code>. The engine serialization logic now handles everything related to <code>Engine</code> compatibility such as targets, compiler flags, wasm features, etc. The module serialization logic is now exclusively interested in type information.</p>
<p>The engine metadata and serialized type information additionally live in sections of the final file now instead of at the end. This means that there are three primary <code>bincode</code>-encoded sections that are parsed on deserializing a file:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>Engine</code>-specific metadata. This will be the same for both modules and components.</li>
<li>The <code>CompiledModuleInfo</code> structure. For core wasm there's just one of these but for the component model there will be multiple, one per core wasm module.</li>
<li>The type information. For core wasm this is a <code>ModuleTypes</code> but for a component this will be a <code>ComponentTypes</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>No true functional change is expected from this commit. Binary artifacts might get inflated by a small handful of bytes due to using ELF sections to represent this now.</p>
<p>A related change I made during this commit as well was the plumbing of the <code>is_branch_protection_enabled</code> flag. This is technically <code>Engine</code>-level metadata but I didn't want to plumb it all over the place as was done now, so instead a new section was added to the final binary just for this bti information. This means that it no longer needs to be a parameter to <code>CodeMemory::publish</code> and additionally is more amenable to a <code>Component</code>-is-just-one-object world where no single module owns this piece of metadata.</p>
