<p>cfallin opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5029">PR #5029</a> from <code>cherrypick-2.0.0-pr5023</code> to <code>release-2.0.0</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix StructReturn handling: properly mark the clobber, and offset actual rets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The legalization of <code>StructReturn</code> was causing issues in the new call-handling code: the <code>StructReturn</code> ret was included in the <code>SigData</code> as if it were an actual CLIF-level return value, but it is not.</p>
<p>Prior to using regalloc constraints for return values, we unconditionally included rax (or the architecture's usual return register) as a def, so it would be properly handled as "clobbered" by the regalloc. With the new scheme, we include defs on the call only for CLIF-level outputs. Callees with <code>StructReturn</code> args were thus not known to clobber the return-value register, and values might be corrupted.</p>
<p>This PR updates the code to include a <code>StructReturn</code> ret as a clobber rather than a returned value in the relevant spots. I observed it causing saves/restores of rax in some CLIF that @bjorn3 provided me, but I was having difficulty minimizing this into a test-case that I would be comfortable including as a precise-output case (including the whole thing verbatim would lock down a bunch of other irrelevant details and cause test-update noise later). If we can find a more minimized example I'm happy to include it as a filetest.</p>
