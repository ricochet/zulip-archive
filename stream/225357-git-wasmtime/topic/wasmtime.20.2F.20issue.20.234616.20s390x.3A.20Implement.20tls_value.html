</blockquote>
<p>Looking at this, I'm wondering why the whole mechanism of allowing names to be replaced externally is even necessary here.  I can see where this is useful for libcalls, in case you want to substitute another library.  But for something like <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code>, that name is defined by the ABI and hard-coded into the linker, there is no way to override this anyway.</p>
<p>So maybe it would be simpler to just add a feature to allow the backend to simply hard-code a symbol name?</p>

<p>I'm still not sure I see it - at least in the case of <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code>, this is not a "real" symbol either way.  When creating an object file used by the system linker, the name has to be exactly this string as specified by the ABI, otherwise the required special processing will not trigger in the linker.  If we re-implement linker functionality in the JIT, the JIT will simply have to perform that special processing itself, which should not involve any symbol name at all.   There is no scenario I can envision where it makes sense to replace a reference to <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code> with a reference to some symbol with another name.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>So the way GD TLS works on s390x is that you 1) have a constant pool entry that contains a relocation which the linker will resolve to the GOT offset of a pair of GOT slots holding the TLS module index and offset for the target symbol;   2) load this GOT offset and pass it to <code>__tls_get_offset</code>, which will load the module index and offset from the GOT, and return the TLS section offset of the requested symbol, and 3) add the value of the current thread pointer to that TLS offset.</p>
<p>There is a linker optimization in play, for the case where you don't need the full general-dynamic support, that will do two things: 1) change the relocation on the constant pool entry to directly place the TLS section offset of the target symbol there (instead of the GOT offset of the module/offset pair), and replace the call to <code>__tls_get_offset</code> with a no-op.   This will lead the generated code to effectively, instead, load the TLS section offset from the constant pool and add the current thread pointer, with no libcall involved.</p>
<p>W.r.t. implementing TLS in the JIT, I guess that depends to a large extent on what exactly should be supported.   But the fact that we add the thread pointer in itself doesn't change much - if nothing better is possible, you can always implement <code>__tls_get_offset</code> in terms of your <code>__tls_get_addr</code> implementation and just subtract the current thread pointer before returning.</p>
<p>This will require overloading <code>__tls_get_offset</code> (and <code>__tls_get_addr</code>) - but those are (and should remain) normal libcalls that can already be overloaded by the JIT.</p>
<p>This discussion is about <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code>, which is needed here as parameter to <code>__tls_get_offset</code>.   (Of course there can also be other uses of <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code> unrelated to TLS.)   This has to be handled by the JIT itself, because whatever value is used as <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code> must match the GOT start that is also used to resolve GOT-relative relocations.   I don't see any way to implement <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code> by just redirecting to some other symbol provided outside the JIT.<br>

<p>Well, the TLS relocation resolves to an _offset relative to the GOT_, so the value GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE must match how these offsets were computed.   It's probably true you can choose any arbitrary value in the JIT, including zero, as long as it's used consistently.</p>
<p>However, this just reinforces my point that _the JIT will resolve this_, even if to always 0.   It will never be replaced by some other symbol, therefore having a replaceable name is not useful.<br>

<p>I've now updated the patch to include the <code>KnownSymbol</code> mechanism by @afonso360.  As discussed above, I've not included any "lookup" function to provide names from the outside for the well-known symbols.  Instead, they only have internal names for display/debug purposes (just like libcalls), and the well-known external name is hard-coded in the object backend.  (The JIT backend wouldn't need any symbol name, it can just implement the semantics directly.)</p>

<p>Hi @cfallin @bjorn3 @afonso360 as far as I can see, this version no longer has any open issues and should be good to go.  (It will conflict with <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4546">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4546</a> as it pulls it parts of that change, but that should be easy to resolve once it's in.)   Is this now OK, or are there any further changes needed?</p>

<p>@uweigand it's not totally clear to me, do you mean you want to merge this PR first and then resolve the conflicts in #4546, or wait for #4546 then resolve conflicts here?</p>

<p>I think we should merge this PR first.  I copied the implementation of <code>KnownSymbol</code> initially from #4546, but then added a few changes to address issues that @bjorn3 had pointed out.  So the implementation here should be the correct one.</p>
