<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>For distribution package managers, its a lot easier if each upstream release provides a consolidated source code archive.</p>
<p>Currently the main <code>wasmtime</code> project needs at least the <code>WASI</code>, <code>crates/wasi-nn/spec</code> and <code>crates/wasi-crypto/spec</code> <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/v0.34.0/.gitmodules">git submodules</a> to properly compile but these do not provide matching release source code archives.</p>
<p>A simple github/workflows task could easily consolidate all submodules into a single archive, as done e.g. by the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/blob/1.0.26/.github/workflows/build_source_release.yml#L23">wabt project</a>.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>Each release provides a consolidated source code archive, that in turn makes it simpler to provide distribution packages built on them and spread the project to a bigger audience.</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>Each distribution package maintainer needs to fetch individual source code archive for each submodules, possibly sticking to the <code>main</code> branch, which may break package building unexpectedly or fixating to a specific commit, which would not include fixes until refreshed.</p>
<p>This is a cumbersome and error-prone way to write distribution packages, which in turn could hurt the upstream project visibility.</p>
