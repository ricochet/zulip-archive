<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Pulley should support <code>weval</code> such that, on wasm platforms, it can be aot compiled if modules are known statically.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>This would unlock aot compilation of components down to core wasm using Wasmtime, along with enhancing <code>weval</code> to be able to process programs like itself.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<ul>
<li>If WASM is not supported currently in Pulley, that would have to be implemented first</li>
<li>A Rust api for <code>weval</code>'s WASM interface would also be needed</li>
<li>After that, it should really just come down to calling the functions when needed</li>
</ul>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>For components, another route is converting them fully to js with <code>jco</code>, then using something like Porffor to aot compile it.  The rest could be done by allowing <code>wizer</code> to use the js engine WASM runtime, which would be provided by StarlingMonkey, which can further aot compile to a component, coverable with the previous alternative. These pipelines, while somewhat easier to plan for, are convoluted for the user and might massively reduce performance.</p>
