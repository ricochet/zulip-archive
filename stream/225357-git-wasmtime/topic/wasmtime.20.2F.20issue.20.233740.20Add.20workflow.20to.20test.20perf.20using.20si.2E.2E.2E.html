<p>This does not work now in this PR because self hosted runner support is no enabled in this repository but here is an example of what this would look like: <a href="https://github.com/jlb6740/wasmtime/pull/2">https://github.com/jlb6740/wasmtime/pull/2</a>. At that link pay particular attention to the comment and table that only shows percent change, the table that shows the mean column will be removed as it is only desired to show percent change. More notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently this is only running a single benchmark but that will improve. </li>
<li>Aarch64 is intended to be setup as well with this same patch but wanted to do a check on if this is the direction we want. </li>
<li>Instead of running automatically with each PR or PR update we may just want to be able to leave a special comment that can be used as a hook to run performance on demand.<br>
</li>
