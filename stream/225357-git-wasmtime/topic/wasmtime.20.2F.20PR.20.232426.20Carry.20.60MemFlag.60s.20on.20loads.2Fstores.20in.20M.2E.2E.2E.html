<p>cfallin opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2426">PR #2426</a> from <code>machinst-trap-info</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>x64 and aarch64: carry MemFlags on loads/stores; don't emit trap info unless an op can trap.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>This end result was previously enacted by carrying a `SourceLoc` on
every load/store, which was somewhat cumbersome, and only indirectly
encoded metadata about a memory reference (can it trap) by its presence
or absence. We have a type for this -- `MemFlags` -- that tells us
everything we might want to know about a load or store, and we should
plumb it through to code emission instead.

This PR attaches a `MemFlags` to an `Amode` on x64, and puts it on load
and store `Inst` variants on aarch64. These two choices seem to factor
things out in the nicest way: there are relatively few load/store insts
on aarch64 but many addressing modes, while the opposite is true on x64.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Includes #2389 as prerequisite; will rebase out that commit once #2389 lands.</p>
