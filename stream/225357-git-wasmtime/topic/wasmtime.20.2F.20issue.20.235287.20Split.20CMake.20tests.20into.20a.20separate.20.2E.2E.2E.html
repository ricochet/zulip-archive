<p>I thought building the C API involves building all of Wasmtime. So I would expect most of the build time to be shared between the two sets of tests.</p>

<p>Looking through the build log, it appears to rebuild all dependencies for each of the two steps. The explanation that Alex and I came up with was that the build flags are different enough that the artifacts aren't reused between the two.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I'm not seeing significant benefit from this PR. Originally it seemed like there was enough rebuilt between the cmake and cargo test parts of the <code>Test</code> job that this would help build times, but after a few runs it appears that there was more work shared between those two than we thought.</p>
