<blockquote>
<p>Currently WASI support is provided by the <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime-wasi/0.12.0/wasmtime_wasi/" target="_blank" title="https://docs.rs/wasmtime-wasi/0.12.0/wasmtime_wasi/"><code>wasmtime-wasi</code></a> crate. This feels like it's a bit too much of a speedbump to pull in an extra crate and configure it just right to get support for WASI. I think that we'll want more turnkey (or at least documented) support in the <code>wasmtime</code> crate itself.</p>
<p>I think what I'd propose personally is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merge the <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> crate into <code>wasmtime</code>, deleting <code>wasmtime-wasi</code></li>
<li>Ensure everything WASI-related is documented in the API</li>
<li>Add a book example of how to instantiate WASI and link it to a module</li>
<li>Delegate further improvements to <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/727" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/727">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/727</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With my idea we still wouldn't really have turnkey support, but it's at least all in one crate and will be documented better than it is today. I think <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/727" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/727">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/727</a> will be where we want to figure out truly what a turnkey solution looks like.</p>
