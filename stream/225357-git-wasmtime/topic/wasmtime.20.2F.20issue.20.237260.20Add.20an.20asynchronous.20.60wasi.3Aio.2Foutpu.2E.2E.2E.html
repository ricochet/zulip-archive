<blockquote>
<p>More feedback, based on discussion with @elliottt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to express an output-stream that can potentially have an unbounded number of input-streams forwarded to it? It would perhaps be much simpler if <code>forward</code> consumed both the <code>input-stream</code> and <code>output-stream</code>, and <code>future-forward-result</code> gave back the <code>output-stream</code> as well as the <code>u64</code>  in the <code>some(ok(ok(...))</code> case.</li>
<li>I am concerned this could be too powerful, and force us to make some difficult implementation choices, when applied to all streams. We have the use case of forwarding http bodies. Could we instead implement this as a static method on <code>outgoing-body</code> as an alternative to <code>finish</code> which is something like <code>finish-by-forwarding: static func(this: outgoing-body, forward: input-stream) -&gt; some-future</code>. That still requires us to keep that <code>input-stream</code> alive beyond the lifetime of the wasm execution, which could be the same can of worms...</li>

<p>This was the can of worms I was trying to avoid opening, and I'm worried about painting ourselves into a corner by requiring certain behavior happen in the background and beyond the lifetime of the component. Could we scope this down to an interaction that only happens as long as the <code>future-forwarded-result</code> is alive, and not try to return from execution until forwarding has complete, just waiting in a poll_list until the forwarding is complete? That will save on lots of back and forth interaction between host and guest, at least.</p>

<p>I believe the current conclusion is to defer this to after the 0.2.0 release of WASI, so I'm going to close this as it's probably best to pick back up discussion after that happens, but please reopen if you disagree</p>
