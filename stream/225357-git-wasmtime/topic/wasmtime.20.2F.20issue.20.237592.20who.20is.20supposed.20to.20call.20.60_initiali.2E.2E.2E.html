<blockquote>
<p>i have a preview1 reactor module, which exports <code>_initialize</code>.<br>
when adapting it with <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1.reactor.wasm</code> and loading the resulted component with wasmtime,<br>
i expected the <code>_initialize</code> export of the original module is somehow called during the component startup.<br>
however, it doesn't seem to be called.<br>

<p>ok.<br>
i put a hack in the (non-standard) entry point of my module and it's working well.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>i guess it's necessary for a reactor built with wasi-libc to work correctly.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the usage of <code>_initialize</code> in wasi-libc for example has been pushed to lazy instead of eager initialization, which if possible is what I would recommend for other uses as well. Otherwise feel free to open an issue on the wasm-tools repository for a proposal about how to add <code>_initialize</code> support to <code>wit-component</code> and adapters of course!</p>
