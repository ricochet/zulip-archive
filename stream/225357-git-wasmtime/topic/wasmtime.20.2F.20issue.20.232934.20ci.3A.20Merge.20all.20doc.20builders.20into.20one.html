<blockquote>
<p>Right yeah, the upload-artifact piece will always be independent since there's always a unique workflow and artifacts are uploaded to the workflow. And also yeah the next change would be to have each release builder push up the tarball both as an artifact but also as part of the github release (conditionally). The latter part will stomp over things by default (I mean that's also possible today...) but with the one-build-per-ref I think it greatly reduces the likelihood of that.</p>
<p>The good news is that if anything is ever stomped over all the workflows themselves have all the original artifacts so we can just reuse those  and manually push them up if anything goes really wrong.</p>
