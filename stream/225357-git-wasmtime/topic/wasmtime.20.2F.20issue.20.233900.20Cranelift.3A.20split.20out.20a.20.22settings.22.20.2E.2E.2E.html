<blockquote>
<p>In #3897, we discovered that Wasmtime's checking of a serialized/AOT-compiled module's flags for compatibility was not running if the runtime was not built with the compiler included. #3899 hardcodes some checks in a way that still works without Cranelift, so solves the immediate problem, but is not an ideal fix.</p>
<p>Ultimately we should be able to talk about the settings/configuration for the compiler without actually including the compiler itself. In the same way that <code>Target</code> is a type defined in a separate crate (<code>target-lexicon</code>), we should create a new crate <code>cranelift-settings</code> that lives at the bottom of the crate dependency DAG, and can be used without Cranelift itself. (It will probably depend on the settings stuff that is generated by <code>cranelift-codegen</code>'s meta crate currently, so we'll have to figure out how to split things apart appropriately.)</p>
<p>This crate should have a way of comparing flags as well. Each flag has some property of "ABI compatibility" which is a sort of subtyping relation: for some flags, code generated with that flag taking on one value is compatible with the runtime assuming the flag has another value. For example, optimization level or regalloc selection don't affect the generated code-to-runtime interface. Nor should settings that affect whether certain ISA extensions are enabled. But, for example, the existence of safepoints in the generated code <em>does</em> affect the runtime; if code is generated without these, its execution will be incorrect if the runtime is providing reftypes.</p>
<p>So we should have a <code>CompilerFlags</code> and it should support a partial order relation which computes this compatibility.</p>
<p>Then, the <code>cranelift-native</code> crate can generate some flags that correspond to the maximum CPU features on the host, and <code>wasmtime-cranelift</code> can also generate a <code>CompilerFlags</code>, indicating which flags are required for a given Wasmtime config (e.g., safepoints, or fuel or epoch instrumentation, etc.). We should also have a way to merge flags; this is a "meet" on the lattice induced by the partial ordering relation above.</p>
<p>Then finally, wasmtime's compatibility checks and compile-time flag selection can use this infrastructure, rather than the hardcoded feature-compatibility matrices encoded into the <code>Engine</code> and serialization logic.</p>

<p>alexcrichton <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3900#issuecomment-1063070300">commented</a> on <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3900">issue #3900</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing worth pointing out is that prior to <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3899">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3899</a> we actually had no checks at all that when a <code>Module</code> was instantiated that the compiler settings configured in the <code>Engine</code> were actually compatible with the host platform (e.g. enabled CPU features were actually available), and this was also one thing that #3899 wanted to fix.</p>
<p>Another thing I think worth considering is that prior to #3899 when a serialized module was loaded from disk into a Wasmtime with Cranelift enabled we'd compare all the compilation settings to ensure that they exactly match the current compiler. There wasn't actually any form of subtyping/etc in the sense of testing whether code is ABI-compatible. Personally I think such a heuristic is good enough as I don't think we know of any use case of having specifically different compiler settings and still being able to load the module into compatible engines.</p>
<p>One example of this is that you mentioned epochs/fuel and those aren't actually related to cranelift compiler settings, that's more of Wasmtime's own <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/2f4419cc6c1c4721a2c36ce39d12c008a6094790/crates/environ/src/tunables.rs#L5"><code>Tunables</code></a> which is serialized/deserialized and tested for absolute equality. While most of those settings matter for runtime code settings such as <code>generate_address_map</code> or <code>dynamic_memory_growth_reserve</code> don't actually affect anything and modules compiled with one version of those settings could be loaded into engines with a different version of the setting.</p>
<p>All that to say that the main issue with #3899 was dealing with the fact that we have to rationalize cranelift flags in the face of cranelift not being available. The logic I implemented in #3899 was my best attempt to interpret cranelift settings, but if we had a separate crate I think we could largely get away with everything having to be configured exactly the same way. I suspect we don't need to implement per-configuration-setting "is this compatible with other values at the ABI level" configuration (as that would probably be sort of a pain to maintain in the limit as well). All of this would still require extraction to a separate crate though so I think that has to happen regardless, I'm mostly just pointing out that I don't think the subtyping aspect is strictly necessary (or rather I'd like to modify things to ensure that it's not strictly necessary).</p>
