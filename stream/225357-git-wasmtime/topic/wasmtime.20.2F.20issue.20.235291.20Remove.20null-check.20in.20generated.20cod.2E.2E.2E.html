<blockquote>
<p><code>MemFlags</code> is a u8 and already has 8 flags defined.</p>
<p>But several flags are mutually exclusive, so we could encode them more concisely. In particular, the <code>Heap</code>, <code>Table</code>, and <code>Vmctx</code> flags represent four states (counting "other") which could be encoded in two bits instead of three.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At some point we widened <code>MemFlags</code> to 16 bits, and in #8134 we added a <code>MemFlags</code> bit for indicating another trap-code, so we could do something similar for this case too.</p>
<p>That means there are four cases (can't trap, or could trap with one of three different trap codes). I would kind of like to start packing these enumeration flags into groups of bits, so that this wouldn't change how many bits we're using in <code>MemFlags</code>.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be the end of the world to add another bit for this though.</p>
