<blockquote>
<p>I got partway through reviewing this today. Overall I think it's in good shape! A tip for anybody else who takes a look: turn on the "ignore whitespace changes" option when reviewing this diff.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely satisfied with the <code>TargetIsa::cloned</code> addition. All the <code>TargetIsa</code> methods take immutable borrows, so it should be safe to just pass borrows everywhere. Unfortunately the <code>Module::isa</code> trait method doesn't have a lifetime parameter so there isn't an immediately obvious way to make it stop requiring its own boxed copy of the <code>TargetIsa</code>. Still, I would be happier with fixing the <code>Module</code> trait somehow than with adding <code>TargetIsa::cloned</code>, if we can come up with a reasonable way to do it.</p>
<p>One option I think might work is a method like <code>Module::with_isa(&amp;self, f: impl FnOnce(&amp;dyn TargetIsa))</code> that calls the given function with the borrowed <code>TargetIsa</code>, so that the borrow must be dropped before the callback returns. Then I don't think the trait or its callers care what the actual lifetime of the object is. That's a little more than I like for a public API change though so it's not great either. We don't make API stability promises about Cranelift but we do try not to make changes without good reasons, at least.</p>
<p>I want to think about this a little more, but I'm generally in favor of merging this PR, with or without changes. Thanks for proposing it!</p>

<p>I think the flags and <code>Target</code> are cheap to clone, but I'm not so sure about the <code>MachineEnv</code>: it has five vectors in it, and I'm not sure how big those are in practice. Usually proportional to the number of registers on the target machine I think, which doesn't sound too bad, but I'm not super familiar with that part.</p>

<p>That's not that big of a deal though, is it? You can build a <code>Box&lt;dyn TargetIsa&gt;</code> and then call <code>Box::leak</code> on it to get a <code>'static</code> borrow.</p>
