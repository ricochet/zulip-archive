<p>@cfallin I have also noticed that <code>x16</code> and <code>x17</code> are reserved as spill temporaries, hence not allocatable - is that still relevant for regalloc2?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@akirilov-arm yes, unfortunately... regalloc2 actually doesn't need any temporaries anymore, but aarch64 itself does. The reason is that a spillslot may be at a greater offset from <code>sp</code> or <code>fp</code> than we can reach with an <code>imm12</code>, so we need a sequence of instructions to synthesize the address of a spillslot before spilling or reloading. That sequence itself can't require spilling another register if all registers are full (as they are likely to be if we're spilling in the first place), so we need to set aside <code>x16</code> for that.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, <code>x17</code> is used in stack-limit check sequences, but my memory is less clear; I'd have to go look at the use-cases again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To follow up on that, I guess an alternative approach would be to reserve a small-offset slot to spill another victim to if we need to compute a spillslot address at a large distance away -- so we can bootstrap our way there with no registers initially free. That's a little more complexity but I wouldn't be averse to reviewing a PR if someone wants to attempt that.</p>

<p>Ah, that's a really interesting idea actually. I guess it's not needed for unwind (that starts from <code>fp</code>), and in the middle of this sequence we won't be doing any calls, and it's otherwise usable as a regular GPR... I like it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm curious about the small-offset spillslot idea. I haven't looked at aarch64 details and don't know enough about Cranelift internals yet, but my assumptions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The imm12 is a signed 12-bit immediate, so this challenge only happens if the stack frame is bigger than 2kB.</li>
<li><code>sp</code> and <code>fp</code> point to opposite ends of the stack frame so if you pick whichever is closer as the base then you could avoid spilling for any frame smaller than 4kB.</li>
<li>So I imagine there's an opportunity for a lot of functions to gain an extra register.</li>
<li>But we don't know how big the stack frame is until after register allocation because it depends on how many spills are inserted.</li>
<li>Still, we could decide after regalloc whether to add a small-offset spillslot; if we need it, making the stack frame bigger doesn't change the fact that we need it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something along those lines?</p>

<p>@jameysharp yep, that's more or less it.</p>
<p>@akirilov-arm re:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>we could definitely change that! The only thing I want to hold as a hard requirement is that we don't build it dynamically per-function (because there are lots of tiny functions and that would be a nontrivial cost); right now we build it once when the compiler backend is constructed. We could perhaps build a few versions of it though, and return the right one in the <code>regalloc2::Function</code> trait -- one for leaf functions and one without; and variations based on compiler flags.</p>
<p>Anyway we're getting on quite a tangent here but if you're interested, please feel free to file an issue to "reclaim spilltmp registers on aarch64" as a future enhancement to track this!</p>
