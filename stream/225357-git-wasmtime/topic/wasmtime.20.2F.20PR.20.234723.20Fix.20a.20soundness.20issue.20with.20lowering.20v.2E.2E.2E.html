<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4723">PR #4723</a> from <code>fix-host-leakage</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit fixes a soundness issue lowering variants in the component<br>
model where host memory could be leaked to the guest module by accident.<br>
In reviewing code recently for <code>Val::lower</code> I noticed that the variant<br>
lowering was extending the payload with <code>ValRaw::u32(0)</code> to<br>
appropriately fit the size of the variant. In reading this it appeared<br>
incorrect to me due to the fact that it should be <code>ValRaw::u64(0)</code> since<br>
up to 64-bits can be read. Additionally this implementation was also<br>
incorrect because the lowered representation of the payload itself was<br>
not possibly zero-extended to 64-bits to accommodate other variants.</p>
<p>It turned out these issues were benign because with the dynamic<br>
surface area to the component model the arguments were all initialized<br>
to 0 anyway. The static version of the API, however, does not initialize<br>
arguments to 0 and I wanted to initially align these two implementations<br>
so I updated the variant implementation of lowering for dynamic values<br>
and removed the zero-ing of arguments.</p>
<p>To test this change I updated the <code>debug</code> mode of adapter module<br>
generation to assert that the upper bits of values in wasm are always<br>
zero when the value is casted down (during <code>stack_get</code> which only<br>
happens with variants). I then threaded through the <code>debug</code> boolean<br>
configuration parameter into the dynamic and static fuzzers.</p>
<p>To my surprise this new assertion tripped even after the fix was<br>
applied. It turns out, though, that there was other leakage of bits<br>
through other means that I was previously unaware of. At the primitive<br>
level lowerings of types like <code>u32</code> will have a <code>Lower</code> representation<br>
of <code>ValRaw</code> and the lowering is simply <code>dst.write(ValRaw::i32(self))</code>,<br>
or the equivalent thereof. The problem, that the fuzzers detected, with<br>
this pattern is that the <code>ValRaw</code> type is 16-bytes, and<br>
<code>ValRaw::i32(X)</code> only initializes the first 4. This meant that all the<br>
lowerings for all primitives were writing up to 12 bytes of garbage from<br>
the host for the wasm module to read.</p>
<p>It turned out that this write of a <code>ValRaw</code> was sometimes 16 bytes and<br>
sometimes the appropriate size depending on the number of optimizations<br>
in play. With enough inlining for example <code>dst.write(ValRaw::i32(self))</code><br>
would only write 4 bytes, as expected. In debug mode though without<br>
inlining 16 bytes would be written, including the garbage from the upper<br>
bits.</p>
<p>To solve this issue I ended up taking a somewhat different approach. I<br>
primarily updated the <code>ValRaw</code> constructors to simply always extend the<br>
values internally to 64-bits, meaning that the low 8 bytes of a <code>ValRaw</code><br>
is always initialized. This prevents any undefined data from leaking<br>
from the host into a wasm module, and means that values are also<br>
zero-extended even if they're only used in 32-bit contexts outside of a<br>
variant. This felt like the best fix for now, though, in terms of<br>
not really having a performance impact while additionally not requiring<br>
a rewrite of all lowerings.</p>
<p>This solution ended up also neatly removing the "zero out the entire<br>
payload" logic that was previously require. Now after a payload is<br>
lowered only the tail end of the payload, up to the size of the variant,<br>
is zeroed out. This means that each lowered argument is written to at<br>
most once which should hopefully be a small performance boost for<br>
calling into functions as well.</p>
