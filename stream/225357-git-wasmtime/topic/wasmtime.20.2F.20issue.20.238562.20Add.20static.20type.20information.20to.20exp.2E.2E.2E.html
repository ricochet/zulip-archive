<p>kaivol opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8562">issue #8562</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>I use the following <code>.wit</code> to describe a WASM component which provides a long living _operator_ that is initialized once and then invoked multiple times to perform some operation: </p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="wit"><pre><span></span><code>world example {
    export exports: interface {
        resource operator {
            init: static func(...) -&gt; operator;
            run: func(...) -&gt; ...;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using this component from a <code>wasmtime</code> host is somewhat unergonomic, because calling <code>call_init</code><br>
returns a <code>ResourceAny</code> instance, which doesn't carry any (static) type information. <br>
Calling methods on this resource is thus very verbose (see below), and there is a risk of mixing up resources of different types.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">resource</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">component</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">exports</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">operator</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">call_init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">store</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">..</span><span class="p">.)</span>
<span class="n">component</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">exports</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">operator</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">call_run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="k">mut</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">store</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">resource</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">..</span><span class="p">.)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Ideally, the rust-representation of the resource returned from a WASM component would contain sufficient type information to allow its (and only its) methods to be called with standard method syntax.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>Better ergonomics when working with resources (reduced error potential, less verbose syntax). </p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>It feels like this should not be too complicated, but maybe I'm missing something and what I'm suggesting isn't actually possible.<br>
</p>

<p>Thanks for the report! This is currently an intentional design decision but not because we think it's a good idea, moreso we couldn't think of a better idea at the time. </p>
<p>One tricky part here is that Rust's type system cannot statically rule out all errors here. For example if the exported resource had type <code>T</code> then that type <code>T</code> is only valid for a single instantiation of a component. Each instantiation should get a unique type <code>T</code>, but that can't be reflected in Rust's type system.</p>
<p>Not to say that prevents improving on the current situation of course. I think it'd be great if the <code>Resource&lt;T&gt;</code> approach could be fit in for more, albeit not ironclad, safety here.</p>

<p>As I understand it, they are (only) of the same type in the context of the component's <code>.wit</code> defintion, but if they originate from different instantiations of the component they are nevertheless generally not compatible (although that should not be a problem if it is only about calling instance methods on them (?)). <br>
When alex says _Each instantiation_ he's talking about instantiations of the component, not instantiations of the exported resource (correct me if I am wrong). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah @kaivol is correct. If you have a resource A which exports a resource R, then if you instantiate the component twice producing A1 and A2 the R resource has a different type between A1/A2. Effectively the resource type has a bit of runtime state which indicates which component it came from. This is the part that I don't know how to reflect into the Rust type system statically.</p>
<p>I'm hesitant to close this though because it would be possible to create a type representing R which ensures that you're using "some R" with "some A". There'd still be a runtime check that the two match but that's probably a better situation than today where there's no guard rails whatsoever at compile time.</p>

<hr>
<p>There are crates like generativity and async-local, which <em>maybe</em> try to solve the runtime instantiation vs compile time compatibility type problem but I'll admit I've never fully understood how to use them in anything but the simplest examples plus they don't support all architectures of interest plus the latter is riddled with unsafe calls so I'm in no way wanting to sound like an advocate but it does seem some projects are using them successfully.</p>

<p>Oh no you're right, the implementation keeps track of which types come from which instance and mistakes are detected dynamically. I was mostly reflecting on how I don't think there's a way in Rust to remove this dynamic check and reflect everything statically. I haven't looked into those crates though, myself, so I'll try to take a look!</p>
