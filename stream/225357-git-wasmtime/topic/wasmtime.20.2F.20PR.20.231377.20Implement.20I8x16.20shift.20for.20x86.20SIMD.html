<p>abrown opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1377" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1377">PR #1377</a> from <code>i8x16-shift</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This PR adds an implementation of i8x16 shift. Since x86 does not have such an instruction (i.e. it stops at i16x8), we spent a considerable time discussing the best way to implement this for x86 in <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd/issues/117" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd/issues/117">a spec issue</a>. In the end, I chose to implement this with constant masks, for which I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make constants declarable in the function preamble: <code>const42 = 0x.....</code></li>
<li>Add a <code>const_addr</code> instruction in order to get the base address of a constant in the constant pool</li>
</ul>
<p>With this functionality in place, I then legalized <code>ushr.i8x16</code> to the equivalent of these seven instructions:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>v0 = band_imm [shift index], 7  # this is pre-existent in code_translator.rs
v1 = bitcast i64x2 v0                # this moves the shift index into an XMM register (could be scalar_to_vector)
v2 = x86_psrl v1                       # I&#39;m eliding some raw_bitcasts around this for clarity
v3 = ishl_imm [shift index], 4     # this gets the index into the mask
v4 = const_addr [mask ref]        # a RIP-relative LEA
v5 = load_complex v3, v4          # MOVUPS the mask
v6 = band v2, v5                       # mask off the bits that would have been zeroed in a true ushr.i8x16
</pre></div>

<p>abrown updated <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1377" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1377">PR #1377</a> from <code>i8x16-shift</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This PR adds an implementation of i8x16 shift. Since x86 does not have such an instruction (i.e. it stops at i16x8), we spent a considerable time discussing the best way to implement this for x86 in <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd/issues/117" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd/issues/117">a spec issue</a>. In the end, I chose to implement this with constant masks, for which I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make constants declarable in the function preamble: <code>const42 = 0x.....</code></li>
<li>Add a <code>const_addr</code> instruction in order to get the base address of a constant in the constant pool</li>
</ul>
<p>With this functionality in place, I then legalized <code>ushr.i8x16</code> to the equivalent of these seven instructions:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>v0 = band_imm [shift index], 7  # this is pre-existent in code_translator.rs
v1 = bitcast i64x2 v0           # this moves the shift index into an XMM register (could be scalar_to_vector)
v2 = x86_psrl v1                # I&#39;m eliding some raw_bitcasts around this for clarity
v3 = ishl_imm [shift index], 4  # this gets the index into the mask
v4 = const_addr [mask ref]      # a RIP-relative LEA
v5 = load_complex v3, v4        # MOVUPS the mask
v6 = band v2, v5                # mask off the bits that would have been zeroed in a true ushr.i8x16```
</pre></div>

<p>abrown updated <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1377" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1377">PR #1377</a> from <code>i8x16-shift</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This PR adds an implementation of i8x16 shift. Since x86 does not have such an instruction (i.e. it stops at i16x8), we spent a considerable time discussing the best way to implement this for x86 in <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd/issues/117" title="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd/issues/117">a spec issue</a>. In the end, I chose to implement this with constant masks, for which I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make constants declarable in the function preamble: <code>const42 = 0x.....</code></li>
<li>Add a <code>const_addr</code> instruction in order to get the base address of a constant in the constant pool</li>
</ul>
<p>With this functionality in place, I then legalized <code>ushr.i8x16</code> to the equivalent of these seven instructions:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>v0 = band_imm [shift index], 7  # this is pre-existent in code_translator.rs
v1 = bitcast i64x2 v0           # this moves the shift index into an XMM register (could be scalar_to_vector)
v2 = x86_psrl v1                # I&#39;m eliding some raw_bitcasts around this for clarity
v3 = ishl_imm [shift index], 4  # this gets the index into the mask
v4 = const_addr [mask ref]      # a RIP-relative LEA
v5 = load_complex v3, v4        # MOVUPS the mask
v6 = band v2, v5                # mask off the bits that would have been zeroed in a true ushr.i8x16```
