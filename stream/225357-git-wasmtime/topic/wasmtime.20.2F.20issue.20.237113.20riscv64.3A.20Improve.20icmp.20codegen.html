<p>The approach we were using in the past is to use <code>normalize_cmp_value</code> for the cases where we needed to make sure that a value had no non-zero upper bits. Probably that function should be renamed, and we should be more aggressive about using it when lowering operations that might rely on those upper bits.</p>

<p>Ok so I've looked around a bit, my conclusion is I don't know enough to be making changes here yet. I'm going to go back to the drawing board on some of this and see what I can figure out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is something that we really need! Currently we emit at least 4 instructions when we could do just one! Thanks for looking into this.</p>
<p>Also this just reminded me that I had a <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6112/files">icmp PR</a> that I had forgot about. Feel free to pick out anything you need from there! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One part that this commit removes is various sign-extensions around<br>
icmp because, at least according to RISC-V's ABI, values are always<br>
sign extended when sitting at rest in their registers. I'm not sure if<br>
Cranelift respects this everywhere just yet, </p>
<p>@afonso360 do you know if this is a known issue with the risc-v backend? I'd be happy to help fix this up, but I'm not sure how deep this necessarily goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We actually don't follow this at all. We follow the general cranelift convention that upper bits are undefined and we clear / sign extend them in the ops that need it.</p>
<p>I looked up the ABI document and I could only find that sign extend requirement with regards to the calling convention, but as far as I know that is handled somewhere else in cranelift right?</p>

<p>Oh dear apologies for missing that! I'll probably restart from there.</p>
<p>I also need to investigate what's up with the ABI business and all that, but ok makes sense that Cranelift considers the upper bits undefined state. I know the ABI bits should do sign-extension as necessary, so I'll try to hunt that down and confirm and make sure it's all working.</p>
