<h4>Label Messager: wasmtime:config</h4>
<p>It looks like you are changing Wasmtime's configuration options. Make sure to<br>
complete this check list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[ ] If you added a new <code>Config</code> method, you wrote extensive documentation for<br>
      it.</p>
<p>&lt;details&gt;</p>
<p>Our documentation should be of the following form:</p>
<p>```text<br>
Short, simple summary sentence.</p>
<p>More details. These details can be multiple paragraphs. There should be<br>
information about not just the method, but its parameters and results as<br>
well.</p>
<p>Is this method fallible? If so, when can it return an error?</p>
<p>Can this method panic? If so, when does it panic?</p>
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>Optional example here.<br>
```</p>
<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] If you added a new <code>Config</code> method, or modified an existing one, you<br>
  ensured that this configuration is exercised by the fuzz targets.</p>
<p>&lt;details&gt;</p>
<p>For example, if you expose a new strategy for allocating the next instance<br>
slot inside the pooling allocator, you should ensure that at least one of our<br>
fuzz targets exercises that new strategy.</p>
<p>Often, all that is required of you is to ensure that there is a knob for this<br>
configuration option in [<code>wasmtime_fuzzing::Config</code>][fuzzing-config] (or one<br>
of its nested <code>struct</code>s).</p>
<p>Rarely, this may require authoring a new fuzz target to specifically test this<br>
configuration. See [our docs on fuzzing][fuzzing-docs] for more details.</p>
<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] If you are enabling a configuration option by default, make sure that it<br>
  has been fuzzed for at least two weeks before turning it on by default.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This merged <code>jitdump</code> and <code>vtune</code> into a new, single feature <code>profiling</code>, adding the <code>ittapi</code> dependency to anyone who solely wants <code>jitdump</code>. It also didn't properly update documentation as <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/">https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/</a> still details a <code>jitdump</code>/<code>vtune</code> feature (with no <code>profiling</code> feature).</p>
<p>While I'm not against the existence of a new <code>profiling</code> feature, could the original two features be restored with <code>profiling</code> activating both of them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ah I merged those since they were both on-by-default and there didn't at the time appear to be much benefit to sharding further. Out of curiosity is this something where you're concerned about binary size of the ittapi dependency? Or is it otherwise not building for you for one reason or another? </p>
<p>One reason I unified them was I also placed the guest profiler behind the same <code>profiling</code> feature and by having a complete on/off switch it would enable conditionally compiling out even more code as well in theory too. I was hoping to avoid a feature-per-profiler, so if possible I'd prefer to solve the problem without splitting it back up, but that depends on the issue that you're having and if it can only be solved by adding a vtune feature back that seems ok too</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As someone who refers to an upstream which disables default features, then re-enables features as needed, this did introduce the ittapi dependency for me as I updated it in my downstream. To be clear, I agree with that policy.</p>
<p>I don't personally care about ittapi's effect on binary size. I care about the fact I now have ittapi in scope and will have to, eventually, read through and audit ittapi to ensure it's non-malicious (or import the Bytecode Alliance's vet statement for it, which I can assume exists). While I can recognize the library is hosted and maintained by Intel, the actual publishers of the crate are three individuals, any of who could be compromised.</p>
<p>TL;DR It increases my supply chain and complicates the package graph for no benefit to me, making this a downgrade in wasmtime's utility.</p>
<p>Again. I don't mind the profiling feature. I just wish I could still access the original jitdump feature. Accordingly, I believe this can be implemented <em>without</em> hurting the performance/effects/code-gen of the profiling feature.</p>

<p>That makes sense yeah, thanks for explaining! If it's ok with you I'd prefer to stay the current course, however. Wasmtime doesn't guarantee that we won't add new dependencies with new version of Wasmtime even with default features disabled. That being said we do guarantee that all dependencies used by Wasmtime have a vetted version by BA maintainers.</p>
<p>Otherwise I'd personally prefer to avoid sharding the <code>profiling</code> feature into a feature-per-strategy as well as that feels like a bit of an overload of Cargo features (we already have a lot). But again I don't feel super strongly about this, just a slight preference.</p>

<p>I fully understand dependencies may increase. That does not affect my commentary on needless dependencies having increased.</p>
<p>As for staying the course, I can respect your preference of simplicity. If in the future, you change your mind and would accept a PR re-defining profiling as a superset of both features, please let me know.</p>
