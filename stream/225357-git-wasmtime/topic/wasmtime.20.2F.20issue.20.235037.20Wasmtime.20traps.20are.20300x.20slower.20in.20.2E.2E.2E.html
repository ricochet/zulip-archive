<p>Stebalien labeled <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5037">issue #5037</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <code>wasm_backtrace</code> is enabled, wasmtime is 300x slower in a specific stack-heavy test-case that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pushes slightly less than 2048 stack elements (~300 recursive rust calls).</li>
<li>Calls back out into the host, which recurses back into a new instance of the same module (about 1k times).</li>
<li>Eventually traps and rewinds through all 1k recursive calls.</li>
</ol>
<p>While I'll admit that this is an unusual load, it can cause wasmtime to basically just sit there for ~20 seconds while bailing out, when it should take milliseconds at most.</p>
<p>Proposed resolution: Keep the option to disable backtraces. While _very_ useful for debugging, the ability to disable them is still pretty useful.</p>
<h3>Test Case</h3>
<p>It's not quite as simple as a single wasm file. My guess is that there's some form of non-linear cost to keeping track of stack traces.</p>
<h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
<p>I can provide a reduced test-case that would help, it just might take a bit of time.</p>
<p>Non-reduced test-case:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for reporting this! Digging in a bit here one aspect I believe is that we have quadratic behavior capturing the backtraces with interleavings of host and wasm frames, specifically each time Wasmtime returns with a trap back to wasm a backtrace is recaptured only to get thrown away later, meaning that with N sequences of host stack frames we'll capture a backtrace N times (hence the quadratic behavior). That may be one of the contributing factors to this and would probably be best to fix. @fitzgen would you be up for taking a look at this?</p>
<p>In the meantime @Stebalien would you be able to produce a more standalone example of what's going on? I made a simple reproduction myself but was unable to get more than 600 ish interleavings of host/wasm deep so I'm not sure how to get up to the multiple thousands you describe.</p>

<p>Ah, we run wasmtime on a 64MiB stack to support cases like this. But I'll cobble together a reproducer.</p>
