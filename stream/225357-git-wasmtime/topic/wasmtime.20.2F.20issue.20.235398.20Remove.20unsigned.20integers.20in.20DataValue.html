<p>It can also bring some issues to the interpreter if not handled correctly, for example. If a operation returns a unsigned <code>DataValue</code> it can cause a test failure such as <code>Failed test: run: %usubof_i64(0, 0) == 0, actual: 0</code> since we parse the values in test cases as signed integers.</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware the only user of these values is the interpreter. Which casts values to unsigned when it needs to perform operations as unsigned, and then has to cast them back to signed values before returning them.</p>
<p>We can instead separate those operations like we do in CLIF instructions. As an example right now we have <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/0456c1d2131e53f4b00542548bb061b11d62f1f0/cranelift/interpreter/src/value.rs#L539-L557"><code>Value::div</code></a> which does signed or unsigned division based on the signedness of the input DataValue, but we can change that to have <code>Value::sdiv</code> and <code>Value::udiv</code> like we have for CLIF instructions.</p>
