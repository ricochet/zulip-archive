<blockquote>
<p>The requirement seems mainly to come from our desire to conform to SpiderMonkey's convention when used in that context, but I don't think we need to completely freeze the bits of our design that overlap with the integration if it prevents us from "doing the right thing" otherwise. It does seem more idiomatic / in line with what the ISA design and other tools expect to actually use the canonical "undefined" instruction for traps; and from the SM point of view, this is a slight adjustment (catch a different signal or similar) in line with other API-change and similar updates that need to happen in the normal course of updating to new crate versions.</p>
<p>cc @bnjbvr for any updated thoughts on this? Also @julian-seward1, if you're around: what's the latest (if any) on maintaining usage of Cranelift in SpiderMonkey, and if it's maintained, would it be a significant blocker to adapt to the use of <code>udf</code> for traps rather than the arbitrarily-selected instruction used now?</p>
