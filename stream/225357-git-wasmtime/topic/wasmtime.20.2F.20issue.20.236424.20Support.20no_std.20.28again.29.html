<p>I assume you want <code>no_std</code> in Cranelift specifically, and you don't care about Wasmtime, right?</p>
<p>The most recent time this came up was #6131 and the discussion there is still relevant. Unfortunately the person who authored that PR apparently gave up and deleted their branch after we asked for the additional work we'd need to make sure we can reliably maintain <code>no_std</code> support for Cranelift going forward.</p>
<p>There's some work to do but I think it's a fairly straightforward path if you want to work on it. I'd be happy to answer questions!</p>

<p>Correct. I should be more specific.</p>

<p>Well, he/she just deleted all their GH repos. But if we still have the patch set we can just try and apply the hunks manually. But this would mean their cobtribution commit would be lost. Not sure if I can just cherrypick the the PR branch...</p>
