<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone, I was wondering if the <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny">cargo-deny</a> plugin, a tool for linting your dependencies, could be added to the wasmtime repository and integrated into CI (or at least be discussed/considered if that hasn't been done yet :)). Some of the advantages it has to offer are:</p>
<ol>
<li>License check: used to verify that every crate you use has a license term you find acceptable.</li>
<li>Bans check: used to deny (or allow) specific crates, as well as detect and handle multiple versions of the same crate.</li>
<li>Advisory check: used to detect issues for crates by looking in an advisory database.</li>
<li>Sources check: used to ensure crates only come from sources you trust.</li>
</ol>
<p>At Embark Studios, we've just started making heavy use of wasmtime and, as we are running cargo-deny in our CI, found multiple versions of the same dependency within wasmtime. Specifically, <code>wasmtime-debug</code>, <code>wasmtime-jit</code>, and <code>wasmtime-obj</code> (all version 0.20.0) all have <code>wasmparser</code> <strong>0.59.0</strong> as a dependency but also <code>object</code> 0.21.1, which in turn has <code>wasmparser</code> <strong>0.57.0</strong> as a dependency. </p>
<p>Multiple versions of the same dependency can cause all sorts of issues so we like to limit this as much as we can! As wasmtime currently isn't running cargo-deny this "bug" might have gone by completely unnoticed. If you did notice but had your own reasons not to "fix" it, that's absolutely fine as well, just wanted to use this specific issue as an example!</p>
<p>Let me know what you guys think! Both the advantages and/or disadvantages of using cargo-deny for wasmtime.</p>

<p>Some more issues that <code>cargo-deny</code> found are:</p>
<p>3 duplicate dependencies for <code>object</code>: <br>
(<code>wasmtime-debug</code>, <code>wasmtime-jit</code>, and <code>wasmtime-obj</code>) -&gt; <code>object</code> <strong>0.21.1</strong> <br>
<code>wasmtime-profiling</code> -&gt; <code>object</code> <strong>0.19.0</strong>. <br>
(<code>wasmtime</code> and <code>wasmtime-runtime</code>) -&gt; <code>backtrace</code> 0.3.50 -&gt; <code>object</code> <strong>0.20.0</strong>.</p>
<p>2 duplicate dependencies for <code>gimli</code><br>
(<code>wasmtime</code> and <code>wasmtime-runtime</code>) -&gt; <code>backtrace</code> 0.3.50 -&gt; <code>addr2line</code> 0.13.0 -&gt; <code>gimli</code> <strong>0.22.0</strong><br>
(<code>cranelift-codegen</code>, <code>wasmtime-debug</code>, <code>wasmtime-environ</code>, <code>wasmtime-jit</code>, and <code>wasmtime-profiling</code>) -&gt; gimli <strong>0.21.0</strong></p>
<p>As for the constantly breaking the build problem, <code>cargo-deny</code> is extremely configurable so it's quite easy to have a temporary or permanent workaround. In our case, the duplicate dependency "broke" the build in CI so I investigated the issue, realized what was going on, and as a result told cargo-deny to <strong>skip</strong> those specific crates. So in your <code>deny.toml</code> simply add:</p>

<p>As you can see, <code>cargo-deny</code> is by no mean an absolute enforcer of, in this case, duplicate dependencies. It's an extremely useful tool to at least be _aware_ that there are duplicates. How you resolve it is up to you :) </p>

<p>This one will need <code>backtrace</code> to update the <code>object</code> dependency. Downgrading the <code>object</code> dependency for wasmtime crates won't work as we sometimes need new features in <code>object</code> (or at least I do).</p>

<p>Makes sense to update all to <code>gimli 0.22.0</code>. It contains several bug fixes, though those are only for the read side,</p>

<p>Hey everyone, I was wondering if the <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny">cargo-deny</a> plugin, a tool for linting your dependencies, could be added to the wasmtime repository and integrated into CI (or at least be discussed/considered if that hasn't been done yet :)). Some of the advantages it has to offer are:</p>
<ol>
<li>License check: used to verify that every crate you use has a license term you find acceptable.</li>
<li>Bans check: used to deny (or allow) specific crates, as well as detect and handle multiple versions of the same crate.</li>
<li>Advisory check: used to detect issues for crates by looking in an advisory database.</li>
<li>Sources check: used to ensure crates only come from sources you trust.</li>
</ol>
<p>At Embark Studios, we've just started making heavy use of wasmtime and, as we are running cargo-deny in our CI, found multiple versions of the same dependency within wasmtime. Specifically, <code>wasmtime-debug</code>, <code>wasmtime-jit</code>, and <code>wasmtime-obj</code> (all version 0.20.0) all have <code>wasmparser</code> <strong>0.59.0</strong> as a dependency but also <code>object</code> 0.21.1, which in turn has <code>wasmparser</code> <strong>0.57.0</strong> as a dependency. </p>
<p>Multiple versions of the same dependency can cause all sorts of issues so we like to limit this as much as we can! As wasmtime currently isn't running cargo-deny this "bug" might have gone by completely unnoticed. If you did notice but had your own reasons not to "fix" it, that's absolutely fine as well, just wanted to use this specific issue as an example!</p>
<p>Let me know what you guys think! Both the advantages and/or disadvantages of using cargo-deny for wasmtime.</p>
