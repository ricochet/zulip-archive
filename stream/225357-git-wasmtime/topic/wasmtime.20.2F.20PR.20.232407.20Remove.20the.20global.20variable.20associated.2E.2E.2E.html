<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2407">PR #2407</a> from <code>no-frame-info-global</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit removes the global variable associated with wasm traps which<br>
stores frame information. The only purpose of this global is to help<br>
symbolicate <code>Trap</code>s created since we support creating a <code>Trap</code> without a<br>
<code>Store</code>. The global, however, is only used for wasm frames on the stack,<br>
and when wasm frames are on the stack we know that our thread local for<br>
"what was the last context" is set and configured.</p>
<p>The change here is to hijack this thread-local some more to effectively<br>
store the <code>Store</code> inside of it. All frame information is then moved<br>
directly into <code>Store</code> and no longer lives off on the side in a global.<br>
Additionally support for registering/unregistering modules is now<br>
simplified because once a module is registered with a store it can never<br>
be unregistered.</p>
<p>This has one slight functional change where if there are two instances<br>
of <code>Store</code> interleaving calls to wasm code on the stack we'll only be<br>
able to symbolicate one of them instead of both. That's arguably also a<br>
feature however because this is sort of a way to leak information across<br>
stores right now.</p>
<p>Otherwise, though, this isn't intended to change any existing logic, but<br>
instead keep everything working as-is.</p>
