<p>I've filed a support ticket with github to see if they can help, the contents of which were:</p>
<hr>
<p>Since last night on the bytecodealliance/wasmtime repository we've been consistently receiving alerts in our Actions workflows which say "Received request to deprovision". This causes the workflow run to fail and currently we can't get any successful runs. Some example workflow runs are:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/9276653595
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/9276831779
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/9277846527
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/9278460559
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/9280206728
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/9283330115
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/9288960611
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/9291171973
</code></pre></div>

<p>These runs span a few different changes so it doesn't appear that any single PR is the culprit. Additionally the failing job seems to switch each time so it doesn't appear that any particular job is the single culprit. Some searching online indicates that this may indicate resource exhaustion (e.g. OOM) in the workflows but given that the workflows are changing each time and the failure points seem to all be different I'm not sure if that's what's happening here.</p>

<p>I also wanted to open this as a heads up to others.<br>
