<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>x86 has dedicated instructions that we could use for the following patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bor</code> with a constant power-of-two: <code>bts</code> ("Bit Test and Set")</li>
<li><code>bxor</code> with a constant power-of-two: <code>btc</code> ("Bit Test and Complement")</li>
<li><code>band</code> with the bitwise-complement of a constant power-of-two: <code>btr</code> ("Bit Test and Reset")</li>
<li><code>icmp</code> of <code>band</code> with a constant power-of-two: <code>bt</code> ("Bit Test") (this one may be a little trickier)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also possible to match any of these patterns with a non-constant mask produced by <code>shl 1, x</code> (plus <code>bnot</code> in the case of the <code>btr</code> pattern). However in that case it's necessary to make sure that <code>x</code> is used modulo <code>N</code>, where <code>N</code> is the number of bits in the result type. See the lowerings for <code>shl</code> for details, and note that the bit-test instructions use their operands modulo the operand width just like the x86 shift instructions do.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>Testing and modifying individual bits is a common pattern in certain kinds of systems programming, so such programs will produce smaller code and may run faster.</p>
<p>These instructions don't modify their operands, unlike the and/or/xor instructions, so they're potentially eligible for load-sinking, and also register allocation may be able to avoid duplicating values.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>This is mostly like adding any other instruction, but as a particular note, we have an extractor called <code>imm64_power_of_two</code> for getting the base-two log of an <code>iconst</code> if that constant is a power of two.</p>

<p>Ironically here they're the same size but I think that's just because a register movement was required, I can see how in general this generates slightly more compact code.</p>
<p>Speed-wise though it may be the case that these instructions take more cycles or something like that to prevent LLVM from emitting them by default? I could imagine though that if the instruction was folded into a comparison and elided a comparison instruction that would probably be a speed boost no matter what.</p>

<p>Interesting! I've now checked a few more cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>opt-level</code> 1-3 all construct the constant mask like you observed, while <code>opt-level=s</code> and <code>opt-level=z</code> both use these instructions.</li>
<li>Even with <code>opt-level=s</code>, integers smaller than <code>u64</code> don't use these instructions.</li>
<li>The bit index doesn't matter for instruction selection, only for whether a <code>movl</code> is sufficient or a full <code>movq</code> is required to load the mask into a register. I thought it might prefer these instructions for bits 32-63 since the <code>movq</code> encoding is so much larger, but no.</li>
<li>None of these configurations use the <code>bt</code> instruction: apparently <code>bool</code> is represented as "anything non-zero is true" so for <code>x &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; 63) != 0</code> it emitted a single right-shift at all optimization levels.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>x86 has dedicated instructions that we could use for the following patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bor</code> with a constant power-of-two: <code>bts</code> ("Bit Test and Set")</li>
<li><code>bxor</code> with a constant power-of-two: <code>btc</code> ("Bit Test and Complement")</li>
<li><code>band</code> with the bitwise-complement of a constant power-of-two: <code>btr</code> ("Bit Test and Reset")</li>
<li><code>icmp</code> of <code>band</code> with a constant power-of-two: <code>bt</code> ("Bit Test") (this one may be a little trickier)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also possible to match any of these patterns with a non-constant mask produced by <code>shl 1, x</code> (plus <code>bnot</code> in the case of the <code>btr</code> pattern). However in that case it's necessary to make sure that <code>x</code> is used modulo <code>N</code>, where <code>N</code> is the number of bits in the result type. See the lowerings for <code>shl</code> for details, and note that the bit-test instructions use their operands modulo the operand width just like the x86 shift instructions do.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>Testing and modifying individual bits is a common pattern in certain kinds of systems programming, so such programs will produce smaller code and may run faster.</p>
<p>These instructions don't modify their operands, unlike the and/or/xor instructions, so they're potentially eligible for load-sinking, and also register allocation may be able to avoid duplicating values. (edit: this is obviously only true for <code>bt</code>, not any of the other instructions which do modify their operands.)</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>This is mostly like adding any other instruction, but as a particular note, we have an extractor called <code>imm64_power_of_two</code> for getting the base-two log of an <code>iconst</code> if that constant is a power of two.</p>
