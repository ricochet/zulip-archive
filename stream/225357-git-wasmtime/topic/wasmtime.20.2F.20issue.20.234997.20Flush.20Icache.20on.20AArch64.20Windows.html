<p>The documentation for FlushInstructionCache says:</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applications should call FlushInstructionCache if they generate or modify code in memory. The CPU cannot detect the change, and may execute the old code it cached.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems that FlushInstructionCache must always be called no matter if FlushProcessWriteBuffers is called or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is that right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, your understanding is correct. Technically the pipeline flush is always mandatory, but all implementations of <code>__builtin___clear_cache()</code> that I am aware of end with an <code>ISB</code> instruction (and I'd guess that <code>FlushInstructionCache()</code> does too) and furthermore a system call (e.g. the subsequent change of the memory page permissions to executable, since we don't use RWX mappings) is a context synchronization operation as well.</p>
<p>The ideal solution, which I had in mind when I opened #3310, would be to have a generic <code>clear_cache()</code> function (probably in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/compiler_builtins">compiler-builtins</a> crate to mirror what GCC and LLVM are doing; I am not aware of anything like that existing, but I would be happy to be proven wrong). Then we would call that function, followed by <code>membarrier()</code>/<code>FlushProcessWriteBuffers()</code>, finishing with making the memory executable. The order of the last 2 operations does not matter (as long as no one tries to run the newly executable code without a pipeline flush before that), but I think that this sequence looks nicer.</p>
<p>Note that it might appear that on Linux we don't flush instruction caches, so there might be a correctness issue. Actually we are relying on an implementation detail (as discussed in #3426), but I'd rather see an explicit operation, hence I have kept #3310 open. However, I would advise against implementing the cache flushing instruction sequence inside Cranelift and/or Wasmtime because it is a bit involved and a solution that is easily accessible to all Rust users on AArch64 is a much better option. In the meantime we can continue relying on an implementation detail; any other cleanup would be appreciated, of course.</p>

<p>Yeah I also doubt I could write anything like that correctly <span aria-label="laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f606" role="img" title="laughing">:laughing:</span> So I'm not very inclined to go that route.</p>
<p>What I think we could do is something along the lines of what @cfallin suggested on <a href="#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime/topic/Code.20generation.20and.20CPU.20cache.20maintenance/near/252357510">zulip</a> create a <code>jit-icache-coherence</code> crate with the interface that we want, use that on both <code>wasmtime-jit</code> and <code>cranelift-jit</code>. This at least shares the windows implementation between both crates, we still need to duplicate the membarriers between <code>rsix</code> and <code>libc</code> since we want to keep those separate. But at least it is a little bit more organized.</p>
<p>For <code>__builtin___clear_cache()</code> can we for now link it in from a C file as you suggested? And later on use a version from <code>libcore</code> if one gets upstreamed. Or if we don't want to do that on wasmtime (due to not using <code>rsix</code>, not sure if that is a requirement), we can ignore it for now and have essentially the same implementation but shared with cranelift.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about this?</p>

<p>That is certainly an option, but my impression is that we are trying to move away from relying on C files as much as possible (refer to the refactoring that has been done in the <code>wasmtime-fiber</code> crate, for instance), and given that on Linux we are kind of OK at the moment, IMHO it might not be the best course of action.</p>
<p>As for creating a crate to be used by both <code>cranelift-jit</code> and <code>wasmtime-jit</code>, since the issue was that <code>cranelift-jit</code> should not depend on <code>rustix</code>, I am not sure how much sharing would be possible, though we do have the option of just implementing the <code>libc</code> variant (and avoiding <code>rustix</code> completely). That would also help with consolidating the locations that @cfallin needs to change in #4987.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've implemented a new crate <code>jit-icache-coherency</code>, that merges all of this code together so that we don't have to update stuff in multiple places, it also provides a common interface that both <code>wasmtime-jit</code> and <code>cranelift-jit</code> can use.</p>
<p>It does change our call's to <code>SYNC_CORE</code> membarriers, using the new method suggested by @akirilov-arm. We now execute <code>SYNC_CORE</code>  and if it fails we retry after registering it. This should only happen once per process, so I don't think its too much overhead.</p>
<p>It also includes the changes made by @cfallin in  #4987 since I thought it was just easier to do it here instead of having to deal with the ensuing merge conflicts.</p>
<p>I've tried to explain the whole cache coherency thing as best as I could in the documentation, hopefully I didn't miss anything!</p>

<p>Forgot to post a general comment with my review - the overall code structure looks great and is definitely cleaner than what we had before; my remarks are mostly about improving the code comments. Also, as I have said before I am fine with just implementing the <code>libc</code> code path (and omitting the <code>rustix</code> one).</p>

<p>I'm okay with libc too, but would like an ack from someone on the wasmtime side if we want to do that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey, @alexcrichton @sunfishcode we discussed this in the cranelift meeting today, and @cfallin mentioned that you might be interested in this PR as (in its current form) it changes wasmtime to use libc on this particular <code>membarrier</code> call. </p>
<p>As a summary: We got to this situation when I merged this particular piece of code from <code>wasmtime-jit</code> and <code>cranelift-jit</code>, both of those crates have to do the exact same thing when it comes to icache maintenance. After merging we had two backends which do exactly the same thing, and to avoid having duplicated code we need to decide on one.</p>
<p>wasmtime already has libc on its dependency tree, but cranelift does not have rustix yet, so to avoid adding more stuff to the compilation path, I decided to keep libc.</p>
<p>I'd like to know if this is okay with you guys.</p>
