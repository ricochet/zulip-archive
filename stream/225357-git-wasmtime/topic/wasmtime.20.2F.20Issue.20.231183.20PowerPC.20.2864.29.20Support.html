<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://libre-soc.org">Libre-SOC</a> is <a href="https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=405">thinking about writing a PowerPC64 backend for Cranelift</a>, since we want to use Cranelift as a backend for our <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/Kazan-team/kazan">Kazan graphics driver</a> (this is similar to RADV and ACO).</p>
<p><a href="https://libre-soc.org">Libre-SOC</a> (formerly Libre-RISCV) is a open-source/libre project that is currently building a completely libre processor that is a hybrid CPU/GPU that implements the Power ISA, as well as custom GPU instructions. We have funding available from <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLNet</a>. We plan on selling a 28nm 4-core chip for mobile and embedded applications, and <a href="https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=376">are also potentially building a much higher performance GPU</a> for <a href="https://www.raptorcs.com/">RaptorCS</a>.</p>

<p>@programmerjake that's great to hear! A few things that might be good to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>We recently introduced a new <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst">instruction selection framework</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/regalloc.rs">register allocator</a>. Both of those are used in the new <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/aarch64">Aarch64 backend</a>, and we'll eventually move everything over to the new architecture. That means that any work on a new backend should definitely use this new architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, it'd be good to learn more about what your plans are around this, and what the implications for the cross-isa parts of the code base would be. I.e., do you intend for this work to land in this repository eventually, or do you expect to maintain it in an external downstream repository? If the former, do you plan to introduce robust continuous testing and releases as part of our existing CI pipeline?</p>
<p>We recently had <a href="#narrow/stream/225524-cranelift-new-backend/topic/spir-v/near/199899542">a conversation about similar topics in the context of SPIR-V</a> with @jasper-bekkers in our Zulip, which might be interesting to look at. Feel free to drop by the Zulip to chat about this more in general! :)</p>

<p>Version 3.1 has been out for a few months, however the download links appear to have been recently broken. <a href="http://Archive.org">Archive.org</a> does not appear to have a copy.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Sounds good!</p>
<p>We're currently focusing our efforts on the hardware side, since we have some looming deadlines. We will probably start working on the Cranelift backend in a few months, once we can focus on the software side again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, it'd be good to learn more about what your plans are around this, and what the implications for the cross-isa parts of the code base would be. I.e., do you intend for this work to land in this repository eventually, or do you expect to maintain it in an external downstream repository?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We intend to upstream all code, though might have a downstream fork to allow for more rapid development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the former, do you plan to introduce robust continuous testing and releases as part of our existing CI pipeline?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't have any specific plans yet, though we do have a POWER9 server that RaptorCS has generously lent us. Another option is for Cranelift to apply for their own CI resources, available for free for open-source projects at <a href="https://osuosl.org/services/powerdev/">https://osuosl.org/services/powerdev/</a></p>
<p>Our processor is not far enough along to run Linux yet.</p>

<p>Neat, may do that.</p>
