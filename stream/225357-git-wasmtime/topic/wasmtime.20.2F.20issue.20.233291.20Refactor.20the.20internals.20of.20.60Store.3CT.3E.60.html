<blockquote>
<p>It's worth pointing out that one refactoring I actually tried out was "what if we used <code>Pin&lt;Box&lt;StoreInner&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>? I actually got pretty far with this but there's a few reasons that I didn't commit to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Primarily, I don't think <code>Pin</code> is the right abstraction. My goal is to represent how when you have <code>Pin&lt;&amp;mut StoreInner&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> or <code>Pin&lt;&amp;mut StoreOpaque&gt;</code> you have to be careful about accessing the contents and not overwrite the entire structure. I misunderstood the guarantees of <code>Pin</code>, though. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html#method.set"><code>Pin::set</code> method</a> is safe and allows, at any time, overwriting the contents of the pinned pointer. That means that whatever gymnastics we go through to use <code>Pin</code> doesn't actually provide us any more safety since it's still possibly to safely cause bad behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise <code>Pin</code> was primarily pretty unergonomic. The main point against it was that, as we do today, we are required to manually reborrow <code>Pin</code> every time it's passed around and used twice. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically the ergonomic drop plus not actually providing much benefit led me to the conclusion that we simply need to continue to be vigilant within Wasmtime to do the right thing. We do still need the <code>PhantomPinned</code>, though, I think. I'm at least somewhat sure that we can't be marking all our pointers as <code>noalias</code> with all the aliasing we actually have...</p>
