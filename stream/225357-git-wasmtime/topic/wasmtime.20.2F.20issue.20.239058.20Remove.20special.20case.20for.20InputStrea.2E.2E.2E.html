<blockquote>
<p>All input streams are implemented using the <code>HostInputStream</code> trait. Except files. They get special treatment. This can be seen in the definition of <code>InputStream</code>:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/ba864e987ef1ab87c439ca6b396264547d2425e1/crates/wasi/src/stream.rs#L165-L168">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/ba864e987ef1ab87c439ca6b396264547d2425e1/crates/wasi/src/stream.rs#L165-L168</a></p>
<p>The special case was introduced to work around the fact that OS'es don't actually provide any _true_ async APIs for files. A more detailed explanation can be read in the PR that introduced this setup: <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6556">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6556</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Currently, <code>FileInputStream::read</code> spawns the read syscall on a background thread and then immediately <code>await</code>s the newly created task. This is done to prevent blocking the executor, but from the WASM guest's point-of-view this doesn't provide any asynchronicity.</p>
<p>My question: Instead of directly awaiting the background task, can we store the task handle in the <code>FileInputStream</code> instance and then use that handle to wait for readiness? Subsequent calls to <code>FileInputStream::read</code> then inspect the result of the previously started background task (if any). And then let <code>FileInputStream</code> implement <code>HostInputStream</code> directly and get rid of the special case.</p>
<p>From the surface this seems like an "obvious" solution, but the PR above also mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We spent a the better part of a week trying to square this circle and this is the best we could come up to make files work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which makes me suspect there's more to the story than meets the eye.</p>
<p>@pchickey, what do you think?</p>

<p>One major difficulty here is cancellation. All other <code>HostInputStream</code> primitives can be cancelled at any time and dropped at any time, but if a background task is spawned there's no way to cancel that if the write has actually reached the OS. Most other primitives use abort-on-drop handles around task handles but that only works because the async operations performed don't actually block so the abort process will actually abort whatever is pending. </p>

<p>Do you mean "difficulty" from a correctness point of view? Or from a Technical implementation / resource usage POV?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there's no way to cancel that if the write has actually reached the OS.</p>

<p>You mention "write", but this issue is specifically about input stream, i.e. _reads_ only. Don't know if that changes things.</p>
<p>Is there any harm in letting the read continue in the background?<br>

<p>Sorry yeah my reading comprehension isn't great recently... But yes without true support for cancellation the guest can create an unbounded number of cancelled reads and the host has no way to handle that.</p>
<p>That being said I don't fully remember the blockers for this. Things have gone back-and-forth on the design in wasmtime-wasi and requirements have additionally changed over time. If possible I agree it would be great to remove this enum, and if you're up for giving it a stab I'd recommend doing so. One possible solution to the cancelled read problem is (a) acknowledging that it will rarely come up and (b) placing a hard limit on the number of cancelled reads and refusing futher reads until the other ones are reaped. (or something like that). That may still run the risk though of not being able to bound cancelled reads across all guests (only within one guest). </p>
<p>In any case I think it's reasonable to explore this space a bit, as the various blockers might be overcomable at this point.</p>

<p>I guess there already is an upper bound in place: Tokio's <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/struct.Builder.html#method.max_blocking_threads"><code>max_blocking_threads</code></a>. That applies to the entire wasmtime process, though. For CLI use cases, where there is only 1 instance per process, this seems good enough. If we need a more granular limit per wasm instance, we might indeed need a thread pool per <code>WasiCtx</code>, or at the very least a counter/queue per <code>WasiCtx</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We'd still have to worry about the unbounded-ness of the queued item to write as well. I don't think a thread pool per <code>WasiCtx</code> is viable since those are intended to be quite cheap to create/destroy.</p>
<p>As I thought more about this though I think I remember the real reason why this is split. For normal streams we don't allow <code>read</code> to block the calling wasm thread, but for files we do. That means that one signature is <code>async</code> and the other isn't. IIRC that's a big reason for the split. We basically don't surface the ability to cancel filesystem reads at all (and writes are probably still questionable but that's a preexisting problem now). If we surfaced <code>read</code> as non-async then we would have to grapple with cancelable filesystem reads.</p>

<p>I think that could theoretically work from a guest perspective but from a host perspective I don't think that would work since that would block a host thread, right?

<p>I was thinking more along the lines of adding an <code>async fn cancel(&amp;mut self)</code> method to the HostInput/OutputStream traits, and <code>await</code>ing that in the <code>WasiView</code> implementations of their respective bindings, just before actually dropping it. That way, Rust's native <code>drop</code> doesn't need to actually block any executor thread. It only _appears_ so from the guest.</p>

<p>I've got something up and running: <a href="https://github.com/badeend/wasmtime/commit/6d8c4719bd79b8b04efbfa0c74ef2d7006df5638">https://github.com/badeend/wasmtime/commit/6d8c4719bd79b8b04efbfa0c74ef2d7006df5638</a></p>
<p>I added an additional <code>resource_async</code> method to the <code>component::Linker</code> which takes an async drop method.<br>
And then I badly modded the wit-bindgen to generate me an <code>async fn drop(</code> method to pass into that new  <code>resource_async</code> linker method. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>All input streams are implemented using the <code>HostInputStream</code> trait. Except files. They get special treatment. This can be seen in the definition of <code>InputStream</code>:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/ba864e987ef1ab87c439ca6b396264547d2425e1/crates/wasi/src/stream.rs#L165-L168">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/ba864e987ef1ab87c439ca6b396264547d2425e1/crates/wasi/src/stream.rs#L165-L168</a></p>
<p>The special case was introduced to work around the fact that OS'es don't actually provide any _true_ async APIs for files. A more detailed explanation can be read in the PR that introduced this setup: <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6556">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6556</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Currently, <code>FileInputStream::read</code> spawns the read syscall on a background thread and then immediately <code>await</code>s the newly created task. This is done to prevent blocking the executor, but from the WASM guest's point-of-view this doesn't provide any asynchronicity.</p>
<p>My question: Instead of directly awaiting the background task, can we store the task handle in the <code>FileInputStream</code> instance and then use that handle to wait for readiness? Subsequent calls to <code>FileInputStream::read</code> then inspect the result of the previously started background task (if any). And then let <code>FileInputStream</code> implement <code>HostInputStream</code> directly and get rid of the special case.</p>
<p>From the surface this seems like an "obvious" solution, but the PR above also mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We spent a the better part of a week trying to square this circle and this is the best we could come up to make files work</p>

<p>which makes me suspect there's more to the story than meets the eye.</p>
<p>@pchickey, what do you think?</p>
