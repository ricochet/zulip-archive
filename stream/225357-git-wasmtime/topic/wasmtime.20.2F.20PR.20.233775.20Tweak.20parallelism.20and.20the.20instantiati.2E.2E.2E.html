<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3775">PR #3775</a> from <code>update-instantiation-benchmark</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently the "sequential" and "parallel" benchmarks reports somewhat<br>
different timings. For sequential it's time-to-instantiate, but for<br>
parallel it's time-to-instantiate-10k instances. The parallelism in the<br>
parallel benchmark can also theoretically be affected by rayon's<br>
work-stealing. For example if rayon doesn't actually do any work<br>
stealing at all then this ends up being a sequential test again.<br>
Otherwise though it's possible for some threads to finish much earlier<br>
as rayon isn't guaranteed to keep threads busy.</p>
<p>This commit applies a few updates to the benchmark:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First an <code>InstancePre&lt;T&gt;</code> is now used instead of a <code>Linker&lt;T&gt;</code> to<br>
  front-load type-checking and avoid that on each instantiation (and<br>
  this is generally the fastest path to instantiate right now).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next the instantiation benchmark is changed to measure one<br>
  instantiation-per-iteration to measure per-instance instantiation to<br>
  better compare with sequential numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally rayon is removed in favor of manually creating background<br>
  threads that infinitely do work until we tell them to stop. These<br>
  background threads are guaranteed to be working for the entire time<br>
  the benchmark is executing and should theoretically exhibit what the<br>
  situation that there's N units of work all happening at once.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also applied some minor updates here such as having the parallel<br>
instantiation defined conditionally for multiple modules as well as<br>
upping the limits of the pooling allocator to handle a large module<br>
(rustpython.wasm) that I threw at it.</p>
