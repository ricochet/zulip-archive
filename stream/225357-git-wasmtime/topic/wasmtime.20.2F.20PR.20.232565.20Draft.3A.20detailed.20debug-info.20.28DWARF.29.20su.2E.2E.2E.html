<p>cfallin opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2565">PR #2565</a> from <code>debug-value-labels</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This PR is an initial attempt at propagating "value labels" all the way<br>
from CLIF to DWARF metadata on the emitted machine code. The key idea is<br>
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Translate value-label metadata on the input into "value_label"<br>
  pseudo-instructions when lowering into VCode. These<br>
  pseudo-instructions take a register as input, denote a value label,<br>
  and semantically are like a "move into value label" -- i.e., they<br>
  update the current value (as seen by debugging tools) of the given<br>
  local. These pseudo-instructions emit no machine code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform a dataflow analysis <em>at the machine-code level</em>, tracking<br>
  value-labels that propagate into registers and into [SP+constant]<br>
  stack storage. This is a forward dataflow fixpoint analysis where each<br>
  storage location can contain a <em>set</em> of value labels, and each value<br>
  label can reside in a <em>set</em> of storage locations. (Meet function is<br>
  pairwise intersection by storage location.)</p>
<p>This analysis traces value labels symbolically through loads and<br>
stores and reg-to-reg moves, so it will naturally handle spills and<br>
reloads without knowing anything special about them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When this analysis converges, we have, at each machine-code offset, a<br>
  mapping from value labels to some number of storage locations; for<br>
  each offset for each label, we choose the best location (prefer<br>
  registers). Note that we can choose any location, as the symbolic<br>
  dataflow analysis is sound and guarantees that the value at the<br>
  value_label instruction propagates to all of the named locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then we can convert this mapping into a format that the DWARF<br>
  generation code (wasmtime's debug crate) can use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't <em>quite</em> work yet with the gdb tests in<br>
tests/all/debug/gdb.rs. Strangely, these tests are marked <code>#[ignore]</code>.<br>
Needs more debugging, I'd like to publish this draft now as-is to share<br>
the design and get feedback / bringup help on the tests.</p>
