<p>Hi there, thanks for the great work on wasmtime!<br>
I saw wasmtime's <a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html#release-process">release process</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New major versions of Wasmtime will be released monthly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I understand, wasmtime is still in rapid development, but do we have plans to release some LTS (Long Term Support) releases?</p>

<p>Currently we do not have plans for an LTS channel of sorts. When the release process was designed no one needed it so we decided to wait until it was desired to help shape what it might look like. Is an LTS something that you are interested in? If so, could you detail a bit more what you're interested in? (e.g. is it "just" stability+security patches? or more?)</p>

<p>Thanks @alexcrichton! As the release process describes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patch releases of Wasmtime will only be issued for security and critical correctness issues for on-by-default behavior in the previous releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like security fixes only apply to n and n - 1 releases, so back to your question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is an LTS something that you are interested in? If so, could you detail a bit more what you're interested in? (e.g. is it "just" stability+security patches? or more?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, we may want some stable releases (for stability) with continuous security fixes on them.<br>
