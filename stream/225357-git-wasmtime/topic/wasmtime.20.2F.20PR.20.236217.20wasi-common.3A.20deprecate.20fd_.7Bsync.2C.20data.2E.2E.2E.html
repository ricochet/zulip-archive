<p>This removes features from WASI Preview 1 that were supported inconsistently across platforms.</p>
<p>We are doing so because these features never worked on windows, and can't be supported consistiently on mac and linux. They have all been removed from the WASI Preview 2 spec in progress because of these inconsistencies.</p>

<p>This operation from cloudabi is linux-specific, isn't even supported across all linux filesystems, and has no support on macos<br>
or windows. Rather than ship spotty support, it has been removed from preview 2, and this PR removes support for it in preview 1 as well.</p>

We have removed them from preview 2, so this PR drops support in preview 1 as well.</p>
