<blockquote>
<p>This fixes the case of a block branching back to itself, but this code will still infinite loop if it walks into a cycle containing multiple blocks and the entire cycle is unreachable from the entry block.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>That's true! And running the fuzzer again with this fix found a example of the situation that you were mentioning.</p>
<p>I've change the approach somewhat, we now do a sort of graph search over predecessors. It is not a full search over all blocks, because we stop searching once we find a block with multiple predecessors. This avoids the situation where we have to visit all blocks in the function for every non local var lookup, which should help a lot with performance.</p>
<p>The original algorithm can deal with these cases where we have multiple predecessors somewhere down the line of predecessors.</p>
<p>I've run the fuzzer on this for the last 2 hours, and it seems to be working as intended. </p>
