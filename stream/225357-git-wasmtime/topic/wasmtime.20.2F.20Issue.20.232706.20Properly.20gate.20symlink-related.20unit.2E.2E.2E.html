<p>cfallin opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2706">Issue #2706</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As per conversation with @sunfishcode just now, it seems that some WASI-related unit test failures I was seeing on MinGW and worked around in #2678 were due to a peculiarity of Windows symlink support: creating symlinks requires enabling Developer Mode, which is not the default setting (and was not enabled on my machine). There is some config plumbing in <code>cap-std</code> to determine if symlinks are supported; we should do the same in wasmtime so that developers can run the full test suite without non-default options.</p>
