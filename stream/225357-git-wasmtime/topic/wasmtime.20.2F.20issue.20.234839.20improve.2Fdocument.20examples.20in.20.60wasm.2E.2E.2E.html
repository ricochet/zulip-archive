<p>I had considered hooking up my experimental regex compiler (<a href="https://github.com/jameysharp/pikevm">https://github.com/jameysharp/pikevm</a>) to cranelift-jit for fun, but I hadn't really thought about making it be useful documentation. Thanks for the suggestion!</p>
<p>I'm curious: what project do you want to use a JIT compiler in?</p>
<p>One way you can help is by keeping notes on things that you find confusing or surprising about Cranelift as you work on your project. We can help turn those notes into better documentation, or even better, fix Cranelift to be easier to use.</p>
<p>Also, I encourage you to join the <code>#cranelift</code> stream at <a href="https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/">https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/</a>. There are a bunch of people hanging out there who can help answer questions.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what project do you want to use a JIT compiler in?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably building a programming language of my own (at least trying my best) but for now just learning more stuff from it to become a bit more experienced. The reason I want JIT compiled language is that I like prototyping and iteration, but interpreted languages are not as fast to be useful in areas like gamedev or heavy simulations so I'm going to use JIT. In the past I've tried Julia programming language and found that is really nice but the problem is that it has GC so gamedev is basically no go (also it is a math-oriented functional language so some things are not so convenient as in e.g. Rust where you have "normal" mutability)</p>
<p>btw currently I'm working on a note-taking app called mem, it can be used to create notes, todos, readlists, dictionaries... but notably it will allow for creating "QA" cards so you can save questions you (or someone else) have to answer later.  </p>

<p>thanks for that suggestion, not exactly sure if I'm gonna be there, but if I need some help I know where to go. </p>
