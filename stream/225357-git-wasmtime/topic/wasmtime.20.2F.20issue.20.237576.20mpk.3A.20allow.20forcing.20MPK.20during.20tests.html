<blockquote>
<p>My first reaction to this is that this isn't where I'd like to see an env var being tested. I think currently for example <code>WASMTIME_TEST_NO_HOG_MEMORY</code> is only checked in test binaries, never in Wasmtime runtime code. Ideally we'd do the same here and only change test-related code to check this env var. That being said I can see how that's not easy to do since there isn't one location where all the <code>Engine</code>s are created.</p>
<p>Perhaps just the <code>wast</code> tests and maybe a few others could get mpk force-enabled with this env var though? Get some broad coverage but not necessarily 100%. Another option would be RUSTFLAGS with <code>--cfg force_mpk</code> or something like that</p>

<p>Makes sense. The commit I just pushed, 3d2102a, limits the use of this variable to the <code>wast</code> tests and the 30 uses of <code>small_pool_config</code>. Forcing MPK in tests that use <code>small_pool_config</code> is not _too_ useful: they only really have one memory slot so we don't check the multiple slices. But it may exercise a few more of the MPK code paths. In any case, the <code>wast</code> tests _are_ useful: any time in the past I've tested an incorrect implementation of MPK, the <code>wast</code> tests have had some failures.</p>
