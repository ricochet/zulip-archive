<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2444">PR #2444</a> from <code>rm-wig</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit deletes the old <code>snapshot_0</code> implementation of wasi-common,<br>
along with the <code>wig</code> crate that was used to generate bindings for it.<br>
This then reimplements <code>snapshot_0</code> in terms of<br>
<code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code>. There were very few changes between the two<br>
snapshots:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>nlink</code> field of <code>FileStat</code> was increased from 32 to 64 bits.</li>
<li>The <code>set</code> field of <code>whence</code> was reordered.</li>
<li>Clock subscriptions in polling dropped their redundant userdata field.</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes all of the syscalls relatively straightforward to simply<br>
delegate to the next snapshot's implementation. Some trickery happens to<br>
avoid extra cost when dealing with iovecs, but since the memory layout<br>
of iovecs remained the same this should still work.</p>
<p>Now that <code>snapshot_0</code> is using wiggle we simply have a trait to<br>
implement, and that's implemented for the same <code>WasiCtx</code> that has the<br>
<code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> trait implemented for it as well. While this<br>
theoretically means that you could share the file descriptor table<br>
between the two snapshots that's not supported in the generated bindings<br>
just yet. A separate <code>WasiCtx</code> will be created for each WASI module.<br>
