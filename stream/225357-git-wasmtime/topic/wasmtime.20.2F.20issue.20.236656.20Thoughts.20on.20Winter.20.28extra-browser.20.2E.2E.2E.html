<p>Hi! No opinion on the issue itself, but regarding the public forum for the Bytecode Alliance - check out their Zulip: <a href="https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com">https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com</a></p>
<p>You might be able to get more feedback there :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@trusktr I think there can sometimes a tendency to see conflict where there isn't one.</p>
<p>We do currently have people active in both the component model work and the Winter CG. The Winter CG is not an alternative to WASI (and WASI is not monolithic; there are multiple different APIs that are being standardized by WASI). I can't speak for the Bytecode Alliance as a whole, but at Fastly we plan to support APIs from both. The one way in which WASI is special is that it forms a target on top of which other APIs can be virtualized, because it includes representations of platform primitives. This means you can have WinterCG-on-top-of-WASI (if that's what you want).</p>
<p>From the Wasmtime perspective, whether an API is Winter CG or WASI doesn't matter. Embedders can choose to provide whatever APIs they want. They can also choose <em>not</em> to include whichever APIs they <em>don't</em> want... it's completely up to what you want to do!</p>
<p>The underlying machinery for exposing the APIs is the same: the Winter CG APIs would be represented using .wit file and various collections of APIs could be brought together in wit worlds. And it would also be possible to define a world that exposes both Winter CG APIs and WASI APIs.</p>
<p>It's this underlying machinery for exposing these APIs that Wasmtime itself is concerned with. Given that the underlying machinery is the same no matter what, any further conversation about the pros and cons of different proposed APIs should probably move somewhere else.</p>

<p>I suppose a more important question is, would it be good too officially support the spec, regardless of how it is implemented? (if it is on top of WASI, but people are directly using Winter, it still seems like an alternative).</p>
<p>Leaving it to library land won't be ideal, won't really make it a standard (I think it could be a good standard!) but <em>would</em> be a way to test it out.</p>
