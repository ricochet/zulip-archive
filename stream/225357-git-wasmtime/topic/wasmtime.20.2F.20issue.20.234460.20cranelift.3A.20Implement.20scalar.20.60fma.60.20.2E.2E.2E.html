<p>jameysharp <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4460#issuecomment-1190894891">commented</a> on <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4460">issue #4460</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I keep trying to review this but finding too many things I don't understand about Cranelift yet. So I'll ask some questions instead. I think there are three main things happening in this PR:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You've moved <code>make_libcall_sig</code> from <code>isa::x64::lower</code> to <code>ir::libcall</code> and renamed it to <code>Libcall::signature</code>. This seems related to a nearby comment in the existing code: "TODO avoid recreating signatures for every single Libcall function." But in doing so you lose access to the <code>ir::Inst</code> that the libcall came from, so you have to list the input and output types for every libcall in the <code>signature</code> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You've plumbed a <code>target_lexicon::Triple</code> through a bunch of functions. I think this is because <code>libcall_3_ret_1</code> needs it to call <code>emit_vm_call</code> but only has access to the x64 <code>IsleContext</code>, so you have to thread the triple through to <code>lower_common</code> in order to stash it there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You're exposing x64's <code>emit_vm_call</code> to ISLE via a new <code>libcall_3_ret_1</code> helper, and using that to write lowering rules for <code>fma</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Does that cover everything you did in this PR?</p>
<p>I would find this easier to review without change (1), or if you pass the <code>ir::Inst</code> to <code>Libcall::signature</code> so its implementation is identical to <code>make_libcall_sig</code>. But I'm guessing the way you have it now is better because it means this function can be reused by other target backends, right?</p>
<p>I'm curious if the target triple is reachable through one of the other fields that's already in the <code>IsleContext</code>, or if there's a way to get the right libcall calling convention in <code>emit_vm_call</code> without using the triple. I'm guessing no, or you probably would have used it, but it may be worth double-checking. If it's possible to get rid of the tedious changes for (2), that would make this patch a lot more readable.</p>
<p>Step (3) seems like it's simple enough that it can't be wrong, but I haven't read up on the details of ISLE yet.</p>
<p>The other thing I'd like to know is whether anybody is using the <code>fma</code> CLIF instruction. It looks to me like wasmtime does not use it, so I assume it's here for use by one of the other frontends, but it would be nice to verify that.</p>
<p>I think @cfallin or @fitzgen will need to review this but I hope my notes can at least help guide that review.</p>

<p>Thanks for reviewing either way!</p>
<blockquote>

But in doing so you lose access to the ir::Inst that the libcall came from, so you have to list the input and output types for every libcall in the signature method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that comment still applies, we are still creating a new signature every time we lower <code>fma</code> even if we could cache (or precompute) that, since the signature isn't going to change.</p>
<p>Losing the <code>Inst</code> is a bit more deliberate, the previous code was essentially just copying the <code>Inst</code> signature into a <code>LibCall</code> signature, which doesen't seem very correct to me. I've centralized the signatures in <code>LibCall</code> since they should be pretty much equal across arches, but this may be wrong as well.</p>
<p>I think using <code>Inst</code> can also lead to a situation where we put a libcall in a rule, and use it in a different instruction lowering and then copy the wrong signature. An example would be calling <code>nearest</code> in the <code>div</code> instruction lowering and use the signature from <code>div</code> when emitting the libcall for <code>nearest</code></p>

<p>Yeah, I couldn't find it, but would appreciate a double check on that.</p>

<p>Yeah pretty much.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think so, since it is not implemented right now, but at least <code>rustc_codegen_cranelift</code> side steps the issue by calling the libcall directly both for <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/blob/11007c02f70130cdc70b98f0909e5c150a2751a6/src/intrinsics/simd.rs#L336-L337">SIMD</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/blob/a298c6908e443fc689c474750df26d82301fd74f/src/intrinsics/mod.rs#L297-L298">scalar</a> version of this instruction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@cfallin Would it be possible to review this? The Fma op isn't that important (we have a better implementation on #4539), but the libcall mechanism is something that we need to lower other i128 ops and this is sort of blocking that.</p>
<p>Changes since @jameysharp 's review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renamed <code>libcall_3_ret_1</code> to <code>libcall_3</code></li>
<li>Enabled FMA on fuzzer</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't see an actual libcall implementation here -- I guess it will result in a panic if used today in e.g. the Wasmtime embedding (but that's fine since the cranelift-wasm frontend won't use the opcode)? Or is it already implemented in cranelift-jit?</p>

<p>I guess I meant specifically for <code>fma</code> -- this PR adds two new libcalls, <code>FmaF32</code> and <code>FmaF64</code>, and I didn't see implementations of them. I was wondering if these implementations were coming later, or in general what the plan for them is? (Or perhaps I've missed them somewhere, but grepping for <code>FmaF32</code> in the existing tree isn't showing anything.)</p>

<p>OK, that seems fine to me; just want to confirm that I wasn't missing something! It is at least a loud failure if someone tries to use the lowering in their own embedding and finds that the libcall isn't provided/implemented, so this shouldn't be a problem.</p>
