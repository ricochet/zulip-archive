<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1577" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1577">PR #1577</a> from <code>segfault-no-trap</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit fixes an issue in Wasmtime where Wasmtime would accidentally<br>
"handle" non-wasm segfaults while executing host imports of wasm<br>
modules. If a host import segfaulted then Wasmtime would recognize that<br>
wasm code is on the stack, so it'd longjmp out of the wasm code. This<br>
papers over real bugs though in host code and erroneously classified<br>
segfaults as wasm traps.</p>
<p>The fix here was to add a check to our wasm signal handler for if the<br>
faulting address falls in JIT code itself. Actually threading through<br>
all the right information for that check to happen is a bit tricky,<br>
though, so this involved some refactoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A closure parameter to <code>catch_traps</code> was added. This closure is<br>
  responsible for classifying addresses as whether or not they fall in<br>
  JIT code. Anything returning <code>false</code> means that the trap won't get<br>
  handled and we'll forward to the next signal handler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To avoid passing tons of context all over the place, the start<br>
  function is now no longer automatically invoked by <code>InstanceHandle</code>.<br>
  This avoids the need for passing all sorts of trap-handling contextual<br>
  information like the maximum stack size and "is this a jit address"<br>
  closure. Instead creators of <code>InstanceHandle</code> (like wasmtime) are now<br>
  responsible for invoking the start function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To avoid excessive use of <code>transmute</code> with lifetimes since the<br>
  traphandler state now has a lifetime the per-instance custom signal<br>
  handler is now replaced with a per-store custom signal handler. I'm<br>
  not entirely certain the purpose of the custom signal handler, though,<br>
  so I'd look for feedback on this part.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A new test has been added which ensures that if a host function<br>
segfaults we don't accidentally try to handle it, and instead we<br>
correctly report the segfault.</p>
