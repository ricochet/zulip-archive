<p>Ah thanks for splitting this out, I missed this reading the other patch!</p>
<p>Unfortunately though I don't think this can be done, the <code>unsafe</code> here truly is unsafe and this is exposing a memory-vulnerabilty-in-waiting due to violating Rust's model of ownership. Or well it's not really specific to Rust per-se, but it's easiest to explain through Rust.</p>
<p>Wiggle aggressively takes advantage of an internal borrow checker and handing out slices which point raw into wasm linear memory. This means that when the host gets <code>&amp;mut [u8]</code> or <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or <code>&amp;str</code> those are all pointers into raw wasm memory. While this is valid for single-threaded instances because the contents cannot change none of these Rust-based views are valid for shared memories because the contents can change at any time.</p>
<p>All host-based processing of data stored in linear memory needs to change with shared memories. All loads/stores need to be atomic and additionally nothing can ever reside in the linear memory itself. For example if a wiggle API gives a string to the host then the host needs to copy out the string and then validate utf-8, whereas I think the opposite order happens today.</p>
<p>I believe that solving this would require a fair bit of work and design within wiggle itself. Given the cost of atomic operations we probably can't do them by default. Additionally it may be too expensive to check "is this shared memory" at all interactions with linear memory from wiggle so having a runtime flag to process this may or may not be the best option as well.</p>
<p>Overall I haven't really thought much about how to solve this problem. We've known about this for quite some time now but it's been a moot issue due to the lack of support for the <code>threads</code> proposal in Wasmtime. Also FWIW many of the same issues apply to supporting memory64 in WASI and additionally supporting either threads or memory64 in the component model support within Wasmtime.</p>

<p>One thought that I have had about this is to sequentialize host access from the WebAssembly threads, either by locking on _every_ host call. If this were done, then the Rust views to the underlying memory would be protected from concurrent modification. I looked for a way to do this <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/compare/main...abrown:wasmtime:wasi-threads">here</a> but am still struggling to figure out how to tell a <code>Linker</code> to "wrap every call with a <code>Mutex::lock</code>" while still passing the expected WASI context type through <code>get_cx</code> without dropping the lock. It seems to me like some refactoring may be needed.</p>
<p>The other idea I had was to lock calls within a WASI proposal, so that one could make concurrent calls to <code>wasi-common</code> and <code>wasi-nn</code>, e.g., but not within <code>wasi-common</code> itself. The motivation for this is that the contexts/states of each WASI proposal are distinct and there is no reason (along those lines) to lock everything. The point you raise above, however, suggests that locking is not just for protecting WASI contexts/states, but also to preserve the Rust expectations of the memory views used by host calls. So maybe I need to abandon this "lock calls within a WASI proposal." </p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't think either of those strategies would be sufficient. You would need something akin to "stop the world" semantics of GCs because threads not in hostcalls can stomp over memory that one hostcall is working with. This means that a single hostcall is all that's needed for things to go wrong, so locking hostcalls themselves won't be sufficient.</p>

<p>Sorry to barge in <span aria-label="big smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="big smile">:big_smile:</span> Is this always necessary, for example, when host call involves memory area that only the instance initiating the call is using?

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, yes, all accesses need to be atomic in Rust. They can be a <code>Relaxed</code> atomic load, for example, but they need to be tagged as "something else can racily write to this location at any time", which Rust only has the ability to do so with atomics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In JS world accesses from outside are not atomic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think that this is correct because in JS the backing memory is in a <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> and all reads/writes from that are done with an atomic ordering. If that's wrapped up in a <code>Uint32Array</code> and you read an index then it doesn't look atomic but I believe that under the hood it's implicitly doing an <code>Unordered</code> atomic ordering (at least according to my <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/memory-model.html#sec-memory-model">reading of the spec</a>)</p>

<p>Reading over this I had some lingering reservations, even with using a <code>*mut u8/usize</code> combo. Rebasing this on <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5268">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5268</a> would make me comfortable landing this, however.</p>

<p>I'd say what JS engines exactly do is relevant only to a degree, the question is what can be implemented here both in terms of Rust semantics and what the project aims to achieve. I am slightly concerned about performance if every access to shared memory becomes atomic.</p>
<p>Just as an aside, JS spec mandates three things: (a) atomics to be honored in all circumstances, (b) writes to be observed exactly once, and (c) reads to be observed exactly once. It does not require a specific ordering of non-atomic accesses or that all bits are written or read for those.</p>

<p>Sorry I don't really have anything to add over that this is the absolute bare minimum required to be safe in Rust. There's simply no other option. If you're concerned about performance then the only "fix" I know of would be to make an RFC in upstream rust-lang/rust to add LLVM's "unordered" memory ordering to Rust's <code>Ordering</code> enum for atomic operations.</p>
