<p>Looks good, thanks!</p>
<p>The ability to say that two fallible extractors are disjoint sure would be nice in a lot of these cases, it seems. For now this is fine but something to consider IMHO!</p>

<p>Yeah, I agree. I had been thinking that we could make extractors for a type that we could use to merge a bunch of common tests together, but perhaps that would end up being too big a refactoring.</p>
