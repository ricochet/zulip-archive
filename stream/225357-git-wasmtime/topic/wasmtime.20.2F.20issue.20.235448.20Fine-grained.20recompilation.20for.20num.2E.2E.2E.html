<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Fine-grained recompilation for numerical constants.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>When developing, especially in creative contexts like games or visual demos, you often want to tweak a constant integer value and then rerun the application.</p>
<p>While live-reloading the value from within the application is superior, this is often hard to setup, and application specific. Furthermore, even if your application supports live-reloading, it may not support it for arbitrary numbers buried within an internal algorithm somewhere.</p>
<p>Having super quick compile times when only tweaking an integer would be a huge improvement to the development cycle.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>I'm not familiar with how cranelift works, but in the context of the recent stencil changes (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/zmqj0g/cranelift_progress_in_2022/">https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/zmqj0g/cranelift_progress_in_2022/</a>), I imagine a way where the compiler could detect only an integer changed, and as fixed-size numericals take up constant space regardless of their value, patch in the new value either directly into the binary, or at least decreasing compile work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe you could create a global and then use the <code>global_value</code> instruction to get the integer value. This should create a relocation which you can fill with the concrete integer. While this is generally used for addresses to data objects, there is nothing that says you have to store an address in a global (I believe it does currently require it to be the same size as a pointer, but that shouldn't be too big of a deal). I don't think using stencils would work well as optimizations frequently fold and remove constants. You have to make all optimizations blind to the concrete value, which using the <code>global_value</code> instruction does.</p>

<p>We could likely do this at least for vector constants, and in most cases floating point constants, without too much trouble, as the fixups can patch over the constant pool.

<blockquote>
<p>I love @cfallin's idea of plumbing range information through to allow different architectures' encodings of constants to be updated in-place, but I think @bjorn3 is on to something here. I expect the compiler infrastructure for this is simpler if we can just tell the generated code to get constants from someplace that's easier to patch than instruction immediates.</p>
<p>A compile mode that puts all constants into the constant pool would generate slower code, but could let us treat constants as part of the stencil parameters in a backend-independent way. If you're already doing unoptimized builds because you care about rapid compile-test cycles, I think that would be a worthwhile tradeoff.</p>
<p>Neat idea, @JMS55!</p>

<p>I might be stating the obvious, but if you want to have slightly optimized code while keeping previous work, you could a pass of peephole optimizations <em>after</em> saving/retrieving the stencil.</p>
<p>So presumably you would be saving, say, the VCode buffer after register allocation, and things like "load this constant in a register or an immediate" could be handled by the ISLE lowerings. It wouldn't quite produce optimized code (register pressure would be pessimistic, because the register allocator would have to assume that you need a register per constant), but it might be a sweet spot. I don't know what the profiles for cranelift look like, but I assume that if you skip egraph transformations and regalloc you're only using a fraction of the time per function.</p>
<p>It might still be too costly if what you want is, say, hot reloading in a video game, but it might be interesting if you use the stencil to compile several monomorphizations of the same generic function.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the idea of the range of instructions to patch to get a constant, but indeed as @bjorn3 points it might be overkill for the use case. Thinking about the very specific case of Rust compiled to WASM, I think marking a global static as <code>pub</code> and <code>no_mangle</code> will expose it as a WASM global under the same name, so if there's a wasmtime API function that allowed changing the value of the global at runtime, then we could even use that _while_ the application is running (through an host function), and not have to hot-reload at all. Of course that implies an execution model where the application is _aware_ that this global value may change at any time, so it might need to poll it, but it would be quite powerful!</p>
<p>And there's another argument about magnitudes: in our large application, the time it takes to hot-reload is almost 99% in the user-side instantiation (think: calling an <code>init()</code> entrypoint function in the wasm module) rather than recompilation + wasm instantiation, so this specific embedding wouldn't benefit from such an optimization.</p>
