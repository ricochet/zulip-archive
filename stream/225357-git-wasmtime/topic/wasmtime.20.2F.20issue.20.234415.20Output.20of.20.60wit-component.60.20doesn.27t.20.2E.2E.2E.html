<blockquote>
<p>Ok I've worked with this a bit and I'm unable to come to an immediate solution. @peterhuene you're likely interested in this as well. The problem here is that Wasmtime doesn't implement type exports because I don't know what those mean (<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/12">https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/12</a>) and I don't know what the purpose of them are beyond the naming here. I naively tried to remove type exports in the <code>wit-component</code> tooling but that doesn't work because it requires types like <code>flags</code> to have a name which is currently lifted from the export name.</p>
<p>Overall I don't know what to do here. It's easy enough to simply ignore type exports in Wasmtime for now or I guess expose RTTI-style information about them. Otherwise though I'm personally uncomfortable continuing to bake in this "wouldn't it be nice to import/export types" scheme without having a clear direction for where this is going. In that sense I would prefer not to simply ignore the types in Wasmtime right now.</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts @peterhuene about how best to tackle this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While that's probably the easiest solution I'm not sure that it's the best way forward myself. I <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/12">don't understand why everything is exportable</a> in the sense of what the purpose is beyond simply naming. If all we want is to name something then I think a <code>name</code> section or equivalent is a better option. Right now there are restrictions on <code>*.wit</code> naming and there are no restrictions on the <code>export</code> names. </p>
<p>I ideally want to stick on a trajectory to this all being in a final-ish state in terms of basics, which makes me wary of ignoring type exports or something like that for now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don't really have a horse in the "how best to give types a name" debate from the proposal repo, to be honest, although I do think exporting types makes sense given its symmetry with type imports and more prescriptive than a custom section that can be stripped.</p>
<p>Indeed, the restrictions on names differing between the component model and wit could be problematic. I realize there is discussion to standardize wit as part of the component model, but I personally think that it should be just a separate representation that sits on top of the component model whereby if you name things according to wit's conventions, then you get to use wit-based bindings generators (thus _wit itself_ is specific to that _wit-based_ tooling). I don't know if that is a popular opinion or not, but I think the component model format itself must have a way to represent interfaces with full-fidelity and thus custom sections feel unsuited to that purpose.</p>
<p>That (needlessly) said, I think we should promptly come to some final conclusion on the utility of type exports in the proposal to move this forward; we shouldn't be blocking the testing of components generated with our tooling that currently uses type exports for the above stated purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My hesitation on exports is that in addition to naming something it also implies runtime support. Given a hypothetical exports iterator from an instance you need to get some sort of runtime value for the type to poke at. Additionally I would symmetrically expect to be able to import a type (which is also something that doesn't make sense to me).</p>
<p>Overall the only purpose seems to be naming, not requiring the runtime bits for exports, so I don't know why we're using the export section for that. If a custom section doesn't sit well with others then we could have a "type name" section or similar which isn't a custom section which lists the names for types. I generally want to move away from the export section itself since we only need one of the features of the export section for this feature.</p>

<p>If you're right, then I think that may make sense in the long term, but I don't want to bake in design decisions today based on a hypothetical future use case that we haven't sketched out fully. For example if resources are exported and imported then they should perhaps be a separate index space rather than part of the type index space. </p>
<p>With wit you can export the <code>string</code> type but I don't think you'll ever be able to import the <code>string</code> type (or why we'd want to allow that), which is why if all we want to do is name types then I think there should be a dedicated section for that rather than trying to wrap it all up in the import/export machinery.</p>

<p>I'm certainly not opposed to having a dedicated (non-custom) section for naming types (vs. what we had before type exports where it was inline in the type section; that way runtimes can just skip that section entirely).</p>
<p>If we do go in that direction, I'd probably favor removing type imports and exports from the MVP until we've fleshed that out more too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the meantime, I think the prudent course of action is to suppress type exports in <code>wit-component</code> and <code>cargo-component</code>, keeping them only for <code>wit2wasm</code>, until we figure out ultimately how to describe a component's interface in the binary encoding sufficient for bindings generation.</p>
<p>This should unblock running components generated with those tools in Wasmtime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Importing and exporting resource types is intended to be part of the MVP (and added to the component-model proposal just as soon as higher-priority things are out of the way).  Having all resources imported from the host via (resource) type imports is a critical part of how host interfaces are virtualizable (and how a component can virtualize a host interface by defining and exporting a resource type imported by another component).  Thus, in general, I think we definitely want imports/exports with the <code>sort</code>=<code>type</code> for <em>at least</em> resource types.  Allowing <em>all</em> type definitions, instead of just <em>resource</em> type definitions, then just sortof kills a few birds with one stone.  In addition to allowing non-resource-types to be named for bindings generation purposes, there are also some other use cases which take a bit more time to motivate and explain, but where type imports/exports serve a more substantial role; I could go into it now, but I don't want to go off on that tangent unless we all want to.</p>
