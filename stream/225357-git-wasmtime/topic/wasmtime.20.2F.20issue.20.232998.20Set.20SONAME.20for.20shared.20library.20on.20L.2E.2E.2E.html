<p>Thanks! Poking around the artifacts on the CI build it looks like <code>SONAME</code> does indeed pop up there.</p>
<p>Before merging, though, can you explain a bit more why this is necessary? (ideally in a code comment in the build script as well). Personally I don't have any experience with this aspect of a dynamic library, so I'm curious why this hasn't also come up before!</p>

<p>I think versioning will need to be done outside of the cargo build as cargo doesn't support renaming the shared library for the version. It always outputs <code>libwasmtime.so</code>. (or <code>libwasmtime-&lt;hash&gt;.so</code> if a certain (internal) unstable cargo feature is used. Maybe this feature should be stabilized? It is currently only used to give the libstd shared library a unique name. Cargo could also get an option to set the SONAME (for ELF) or install name (for Mach-O) automatically.)</p>

<p>Hi @alexcrichton,</p>
<p>As explained in the issue <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2996">2996</a> the reason for this change is that shared libraries without SONAME are not easy to use within CMake. Actually, the CMake guys consider shared libraries without an SONAME as a bug.</p>
<p>Basically, I don’t care how setting the SONAME is achieved. Using a “build.rs” script is one way of achieving this. Using “cargo-c” would also be an option.</p>
<p>In the end, what is important, is that the downloaded libs (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/download/v0.28.0/wasmtime-v0.28.0-x86_64-linux-c-api.tar.xz">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/download/v0.28.0/wasmtime-v0.28.0-x86_64-linux-c-api.tar.xz</a>) as well as the libs built via command line (e.g. <code>cargo build --release -p wasmtime-c-api</code>) have a valid SONAME.<br>
If there are better solutions, I'm happy to cancel my PR.</p>
<p>Thanks, Martin</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right yeah I understand that CMake wants SONAME, but I'm asking a possibly depeer questions which is 'why?'. What is SONAME? Why do packagers and CMake want this value set? Why isn't it set by default in linkers? Is there a reasonable default to set?</p>
<p>If we need to support different SONAME values depending on the context then the binary artifacts we distribute probably want to  use the <code>patchelf</code> method as part of a CI script rather than as part of a build script which sets it for everyone. If this SONAME works for everyone, though, then this is fine.</p>
<p>Basically I have no idea what SONAME is so I don't know how to answer these questions myself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally I'd prefer to not be in the business of versioning the ABI/API of this just yet, it's not necessarily stable enough that we track all the minutae of changing APIs over time and will remember to bump versions here and there.</p>
<p>I still don't really understand what this field does unfortunately. I don't know why linkers don't place it in there by default, why if <code>libwasmtime.so</code> is a default value it's not just inferred to be that, or what a <code>NEEDED</code> entry is and why it needs to match the filename of the library. I've never run across this in my time with Rust...</p>
<p>In any case can you add some comments to the build script as to why the value is being added? If <code>libwasmtime.so</code> is a reasonable default then we can just do that and other consumers can presumably do something different with <code>patchelf</code> if they'd like.</p>

<p>A DT_NEEDED entry in an ELF file defines that a shared library is being depended on. Without the dynamic linker has no idea that the shared library is necessary at all. It's value defines the filename of the shared library as looked up in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>

<p>Hi @alexcrichton ,</p>
<p>I’m terribly sorry that my educational skills aren’t good enough to explain this topic in enough depth.</p>
<p>The problem does not appear when staying in the Rust world. It appears when libraries created in Rust are to be used in C/C++. What the Rust build-chain produces is not in line what the C/C++ world considers as a good C-ABI citizen. The already mentioned <code>cargo-c</code> crate seems to offer that functionality for library providers.</p>
<p>My ask is to add C-ABI compatibility to the Wasmtime library, in order to enhance its acceptance and increase its usage in the C/C++ community. This could be done via <code>cargo-c</code> or by the <code>build.rs</code> trick that I suggested. I added some explanations to my PR, but if even experts like you don’t understand what I’m explaining, then I think it’s of not much use.</p>
<p>Sorry again, and best regards<br>
Martin<br>

<p>That would require the C world to rename <a href="http://libwasmtime.so">libwasmtime.so</a> in to that filename for the dynamic linker to be able to find it. If anything, cargo should be doing this rename and setting the SONAME.</p>

<p>With the caveat that I'm out of my depth here, I poked around on my own box (Fedora 34) and found that a bunch of libraries have files <code>/usr/lib64/libXXX.so.N</code> (e.g., <code>libc.so.6</code>) that are symlinks to <code>libXXX-VERSION.so</code> (e.g., <code>libc-2.33.so</code>).</p>
<p>However I'm not able to discern how <code>ld</code> finds these -- a <code>gcc --verbose</code> shows just a <code>-lc</code> on the commandline to <code>collect2</code> (which invokes the linker), but if I pick another random library on my system and try to add a <code>-l</code> option for it (e.g. <code>-ljson-c</code> for <code>libjson-c.so.5</code>), this doesn't work; I need to give the full path to the <code>.so</code>.</p>
<p>@MartinKolbAtWork perhaps you can help us out here -- would it be idiomatic to use a git-hash as a version, and if so, how might we make this work in a way that allows <code>-lwasmtime</code> to still do the right thing?</p>

<p>Hi @alexcrichton , @cfallin, et al,</p>
<p>Thanks for all the comments.<br>
I think I need to <strong>revoke my ask to consider also the versioning aspect</strong> when providing an SONAME.<br>
I think the <strong>complexity</strong> that needs to be introduced <strong>will rarely help anyone</strong> and might <strong>make the simple use-case</strong> (for consumers not caring about versioning) <strong>more complicated</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s face today’s reality: We ship our software to production (or to customers) via containers. This container contains the application along with the exact version of the shared libraries that are needed to run the application. There’s no longer a large Linux server that applications are installed on, where we need to consider other/older versions of the same library to be present.</p>
<p>My <strong>main goal is to make the simplest use-case very simple</strong>. The simplest use-case is that I use a shared library like “libwasmtime.so”, and I don’t care about versioning, I just use my current built/downloaded version of “libwasmtime.so” and link and package it with an application.<br>
For that use-case (which is IMHO probably the 99% use-case) and <strong>unversioned file-name like “libwasmtime.so” and an unversioned SONAME with “libwasmtime.so” will do a perfect job</strong>.</p>
<p>My center of expertise is C/C++, and when @alexcrichton asked me for a PR I did my best to provide a solution that fits into the Rust universe. I saw that Wasmtime already used “build.rs” files at some places, so I simply picked that approach. I know that the <strong>same can be achieved via linker settings in “rustflags”</strong> of “.cargo/config/toml”. Another approach is using <strong>creates like “cargo-c”</strong>. As my experience in Rust is far from being an expert, I leave the <strong>final decision</strong> on how to solve this <strong>to experts</strong> like @alexcrichton .</p>
<p>I added another commit to my PR, fixing some “cargo fmt” issues that I introduced with my explanatory comments.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br>
Let’s <strong>fix the simple things</strong> that helps consumers of “libwasmtime.so” in the C/C++ realm: Provide an <strong>unversioned filename and SONAME: “libwasmtime.so”</strong><br>
<strong>Refrain from tackling the versioning aspect</strong>, because it makes even simple things more complex, and is of limited use (especially in today’s container world)</p>
<p>Thanks, Martin<br>
</p>

<p>Thank you @MartinKolbAtWork </p>
<p>As the SONAME is something used for versioning and backwards-compatibility information, it is somewhat ironical to add it unversioned!</p>
<p>However, I agree that it can fix your immediate concern (CMake compatibility), even if this unversioned SONAME fails its original purpose. As a proper versioning and guaranty of API compatibility adds complexity, I understand that this PR may be a simpler "fix".</p>
<p>Regarding Fedora packaging of Wasmtime (which has to deal with ABI versioning, as any other Linux distribution), I think I'll use cargo-c, which is handy for C-ABI compatible libraries (BTW, cargo-c should support <a href="https://github.com/lu-zero/cargo-c/issues/184#issuecomment-866099540">in the near future</a> multiple pre-generated header files as used by Wasmtime).</p>
<p>I've found out that the SONAME set in <code>build.rs</code> with this PR overrides the SONAME set by cargo-c, so I'll have to patch Wasmtime in Fedora to remove the unversioned SONAME (but this is not blocker).</p>

<p>Hm so I think the best solution given all this might be for us to publish unversioned SONAME binaries from our CI, but to not apply a SONAME by default? That would involve running <code>patchelf</code> I think <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/b8c0ac72f10dc92efd94952b3dd94b43ea32d195/ci/build-tarballs.sh#L62-L67">around here</a>. It sounds like that will keep the "simple method of downloads" (our CI) simple to integrate (it has a simple SONAME) and additionally packagers and/or others adding versioning information can do so without having to patch Wasmtime.</p>

<p>Hi @alexcrichton,</p>
<p>We have not taken a final decision yet, but usually we prefer building software on our own machines, with toolchains curated to our needs. Currently we build the c-api part: <code>cargo build --release -p wasmtime-c-api</code> and use the library created as build result.</p>
<p>This means that the suggested solution <strong>will not work for us</strong>. But actually, I don’t want to push too much for a solution that might be a specific solution for our use-case only.<br>
If you feel that adding the SONAME during packaging is the right way to go, I have no objection.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and your support.<br>
Best, Martin<br>
</p>

<p>I think <code>cargo rustc --release -p wasmtime-c-api -- -Clink-arg=-Wl,-soname,libwasmtime.so</code> will work for your usecase.</p>

<p>Hi @alexcrichton  and @bjorn3 ,</p>
<p>Thanks for your hints. The statement mentioned by @bjorn3  creates indeed a <code>libwasmtime.so</code> that has an SONAME.</p>
<p>However, doing it this way is just another workaround, that is no improvement compared to the workaround that I can use on CMake side.</p>
<p>Using cargo to build the needed packages is one thing, but passing compiler/linker commands breaks encapsulation, because you need white-box knowledge to know if this works. If, in the future, there should be changes in the internal compiler/linker settings inside the builds, this setting might even interfere with these.</p>
<p>I assumed that the Wasmtime committers have the intention to make the usage of <code>libwasmtime.so</code> as easy as possible for anyone. You should just download or build <code>libwasmtime.so</code> and there you go:<br>
No need to waste hours to find out why things don’t work.<br>
No need to find out workarounds on CMake side.<br>
No need to find out about workarounds at “cargo build” side.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of Wasmtime, and I think to promote the success of Wasmtime, you have to make it as easy as possible to use it.</p>
<p>Providing the SONAME at packaging time is IMO a step in the right direction, but it does not help people who build Wasmtime on their own.</p>
<p>I assume that my PR which tries to integrate SONAME via <code>build.rs</code> is no longer needed. Therefore, I’ll close it of there are no objections from your side.</p>
<p>Thanks for the time and energy that you spent on my request and thanks for your suggestions and workarounds.</p>
<p>Best, Martin<br>

<p>Sure yeah, FWIW I still think this is worthwhile to do as part of the release build process, even if we don't necessarily do it by default, but it's fine for that to happen as a future PR.</p>
