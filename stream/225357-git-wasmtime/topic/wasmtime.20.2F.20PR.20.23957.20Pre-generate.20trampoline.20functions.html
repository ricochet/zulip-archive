<p>alexcrichton updated <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/957" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/957">PR #957</a> from <code>local-trampolines</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>wasmtime</code> crate supports calling arbitrary function signatures in<br>
wasm code, and to do this it generates "trampoline functions" which have<br>
a known ABI that then internally convert to a particular signature's ABI<br>
and call it. These trampoline functions are currently generated<br>
on-the-fly and are cached in the global <code>Store</code> structure. This,<br>
however, is suboptimal for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to how code memory is managed each trampoline resides in its own<br>
  64kb allocation of memory. This means if you have N trampolines you're<br>
  using N * 64kb of memory, which is quite a lot of overhead!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trampolines are never free'd, even if the referencing module goes<br>
  away. This is similar to #925.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trampolines are a source of shared state which prevents <code>Store</code> from<br>
  being easily thread safe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This commit refactors how trampolines are managed inside of the<br>
<code>wasmtime</code> crate and jit/runtime internals. All trampolines are now<br>
allocated in the same pass of <code>CodeMemory</code> that the main module is<br>
allocated into. A trampoline is generated per-signature in a module as<br>
well, instead of per-function. This cache of trampolines is stored<br>
directly inside of an <code>Instance</code>. Trampolines are stored based on<br>
<code>VMSharedSignatureIndex</code> so they can be looked up from the internals of<br>
the <code>ExportFunction</code> value.</p>
<p>The <code>Func</code> API has been updated with various bits and pieces to ensure<br>
the right trampolines are registered in the right places. Overall this<br>
should ensure that all trampolines necessary are generated up-front<br>
rather than lazily. This allows us to remove the trampoline cache from<br>
the <code>Compiler</code> type, and move one step closer to making <code>Compiler</code><br>
threadsafe for usage across multiple threads.</p>
<p>Note that as one small caveat the <code>Func::wrap*</code> family of functions<br>
don't need to generate a trampoline at runtime, they actually generate<br>
the trampoline at compile time which gets passed in.</p>
<p>Also in addition to shuffling a lot of code around this fixes one minor<br>
bug found in <code>code_memory.rs</code>, where <code>self.position</code> was loaded before<br>
allocation, but the allocation may push a new chunk which would cause<br>
<code>self.position</code> to be zero instead.</p>

<p>alexcrichton updated <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/957" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/957">PR #957</a> from <code>local-trampolines</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>wasmtime</code> crate supports calling arbitrary function signatures in<br>
wasm code, and to do this it generates "trampoline functions" which have<br>
a known ABI that then internally convert to a particular signature's ABI<br>
and call it. These trampoline functions are currently generated<br>
on-the-fly and are cached in the global <code>Store</code> structure. This,<br>
however, is suboptimal for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to how code memory is managed each trampoline resides in its own<br>
  64kb allocation of memory. This means if you have N trampolines you're<br>
  using N * 64kb of memory, which is quite a lot of overhead!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trampolines are never free'd, even if the referencing module goes<br>
  away. This is similar to #925.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trampolines are a source of shared state which prevents <code>Store</code> from<br>
  being easily thread safe.</p>
