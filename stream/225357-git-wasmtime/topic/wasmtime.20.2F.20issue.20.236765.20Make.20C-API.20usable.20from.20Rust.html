<p>Yes, I guess it didn't really become clear. Tree-sitter is written in C and provides Rust bindings. The C part uses wasmtime internally. The build script for the Rust bindings compiles the C code. For this, the wasmtime C library must be available because the tree-sitter C code uses it. The easiest way to have it available is to add it as a cargo dependency.</p>

<p>So the Rust crate does _not_ interface with wasmtime directly (that could be done with the normal <code>wasmtime</code> crate), but the C code it provides bindings to _does_. The safe/unsafe functions from the <code>wasmtime-c-api</code> crate still only get called from C, not from Rust.</p>

<p>Ok and to address the failing CI, this is because the C library is expected to just be called <code>wasmtime</code> (or <code>libwasmtime.a</code>), whereas with this change it is called <code>wasmtime_c_api</code> instead. That's obviously not desired, but necessary for tree-sitter to additionally depend on the normal Rust <code>wasmtime</code> crate. I think the best alternative would be to revert the name change and re-export the Rust <code>wasmtime</code> API from the <code>wasmtime-c-api</code> crate. This way, tree-sitter only needs to depend on <code>wasmtime-c-api</code> for both the normal Rust API and the C API.</p>

<p>Hm ok it might be good to better understand your use case first then. This is a recipe for things going wrong where a Rust crate depends on a C library which depends on a Rust library.

<hr>
<p>At least for me I've never found a way to strike a right balance providing a C API from a Rust crate. I've gotten requests like this historically to support the C API both when used from Rust and C and I don't know how best to organize and enable that. In the end though if this works for you (it'd be good to end-to-end test to confirm) then my concerns are pretty niche and we can go ahead and merge it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, the proposed solution only has one Rust and one C part which interoperate. The tree-sitter Rust bindings call functions from the C part, and the C part calls the wasmtime functions from the Rust part. Note that the wasmtime functions are in the same Rust binary as the tree-sitter bindings (because the wasmtime C API is used as a dependency) so there will only be one Rust stdlib and no linking issues. The use of the C API is required as tree-sitter should also be usable from C, just that there users will have to manually provide wasmtime.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Rust bindings don't interface with the wasmtime C API directly, but the C code called from the Rust bindings uses the wasmtime C API. Additionally, the Rust bindings use a small part of the native Rust API, actually just <code>Engine</code>. Due to the lib name clash between <code>wasmtime</code> and <code>wasmtime-c-api</code>, a re-export is required for the usage of both crates simultaneously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain more about why <code>pub use</code> is required? That's venturing more into the territory of this seems to situation-solve a specific use case which isn't documented and won't be guarnateed to continue working. For example that's a very easy thing to overlook and accidentally remove during a refactoring or something like that.</p>
<p>Again though I don't know if there are any widely used idioms about defining C APIs in Rust and using them from Rust as well. This is not a use case I've ever seen before work successfully, so I don't know how best to organize this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the wasmtime functions are in the same Rust binary as the tree-sitter bindings (because the wasmtime C API is used as a dependency)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll note as well that what you're describing here is a circular dependency between libraries which is not guaranteed to work with all native linkers. To get circular dependencies to always work native linkers have <code>--start-group</code> and <code>--end-group</code> options (or similar) which are required to indicate that there are circular references within that set of arguments passed. The Rust compiler would not pass these for arbitrary libraries and there's no means of doing so in general. While some platforms may work (e.g. the ones you've tested) it's unlikely to work on all platforms or into the future (e.g. in the face of future refactorings)</p>

<p>Sorry if I may be repeating myself, I've been doing a bit of travel and lost context on this...</p>

<p>I don't think there's a dependency cycle here. The dependencies between the different compilation units are as follows:</p>

<p>All of the edges in this graph are expressed directly to Cargo, except for the dependency between 2 and 3 (because 2 is a C library compiled in a build script).

<p>Can you explain more about why <code>pub use</code> is required?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>pub use</code> isn't strictly required, but we do need some way to access the items in the <code>wasmtime</code> crate, while depending on the <code>wasmtime-c-api</code> crate. Right now, we're prevented from importing anything from <code>wasmtime</code> while depending on <code>wasmtime-c-api</code>, because <code>wasmtime-c-api</code> does this in its Cargo.toml:</p>

<p>Ok thanks for coming back to this, and given how useful it is for y'all I think this is ok to land. If issues come up we can try to work with you to figure out how to fix it (if any), and otherwise can take care of things in the meantime.</p>
<p>Testing locally I don't think the <code>pub use</code> is required with a bit of a Cargo workaround:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="TOML"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[dependencies]</span>
<span class="n">wasmtime</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">"*"</span>
<span class="n">this-is-your-name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">version</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">"*"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">package</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">'wasmtime-c-api'</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>package</code> key tricks cargo into passing <code>--extern this_is_your_name=...</code>. Note that <code>this-is-your-name</code> could even be <code>wasmtime-c-api</code> which would allow Rust code to use <code>wasmtime_c_api::...</code>.</p>
<p>I'm going to go ahead and queue this up for merge and I'll send a follow-up to remove the <code>pub use</code> under the assumption that it's best to go ahead and land this somewhat-old PR rather than ask for further changes.</p>
<p>Thank you again for following up, it's appreciated!<br>
</p>

<p>Thanks so much @alexcrichton, and I really appreciate that solution of using a custom dependency name. I didn't know you could do that!</p>
