<p>Do you know how complicated that would be initially—and how much of a maintenance burden it'd be on an ongoing basis? If neither is a concern, this makes sense to me. Otherwise, I think we should let the be driven by use cases.</p>

<p>Ah, I now see the wasmtime-go issue. I guess the question is how many people will want to run Go programs on Windows, which I don't have a good handle on.</p>

<p>Oh sorry I should have clarified, but I definitely agree that we should let use cases and difficulty of implementation guide this in terms of priorities. I don't think it's clear how motivated this is right now (I don't know how often it'd be wanted on Go for Windows). I suspect this would be relatively difficult because of stack unwinding, but I might give this a go later today and see if it "trivially works" or "trivially doesn't work". Basically I think it's probably worth a little bit of effort to see how much effort it would take for us to support this.</p>

<p>Turns out that with <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1490" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1490">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1490</a> all tests pass. I think there's probably some difference in how big the stack is when a segfault comes in which causes issues today, but once <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1490" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1490">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1490</a> lands I can look into adding this to CI.
