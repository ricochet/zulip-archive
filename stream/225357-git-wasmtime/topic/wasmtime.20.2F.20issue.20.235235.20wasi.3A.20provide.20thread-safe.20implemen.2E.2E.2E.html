<blockquote>
<p>With the presence of shared memories and, eventually, with <code>wasi-threads</code> providing a way to spawn multiple Wasm threads, access to the WASI state will no longer be single-threaded. This state (e.g., <code>WasiCtx</code> for <code>wasi-common</code>) must be appropriately protected from concurrent access, e.g., by locking as @haraldh has attempted <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/compare/main...haraldh:wasi-threads-working#diff-17b05d322dd94f0dc7b1dabfed6c015c8729f0ceb2cea9939a55af7296974485R14">here</a>.</p>
<p>What complicates this issue is that I expect that not all users of Wasmtime will want to pay the performance penalty for locking access to WASI. This means that we may need two implementations for each WASI state object, ideally factored so that all the meaningful bits are kept in one place. Also, there may be some complications when wiring up either the single-threaded or thread-safe implementations of each WASI context during linking; presumably the thread-safe version should be used when the <code>threads</code> feature is enabled, but it is unclear if all of the <code>Host</code> types will be agreeable with this.</p>

<ol>
<li>_Benchmarking_: adding <code>RwLock</code>s (e.g.) to various fields of the WASI context structures could add some locking overhead for each WASI call. @alexcrichton hypothesized that this overhead would be minimal compared to the overhead already imposed by Wiggle. We decided to benchmark a locking implementation of <code>wasi-common</code> in order to decide if we can apply locking unconditionally or if we have to (undesirably) maintain two implementations of each WASI context. Now that #5274 and #5309 are merged, we can actually measure this: use <code>cargo bench wasi/</code> to run these new benchmarks first with the current <code>HEAD</code> and subsequently with a locking implementation.</li>
<li>_Async_: <code>wasi-common</code> is designed to support both asynchronous and synchronous calls; we decided when we met that we shouldn't allow async and <code>wasi-threads</code> to mix. In my mind, this involved some (perhaps major) refactoring to <code>wasi-common</code>; @haraldh had some questions along this lines IIRC. We had discussed a separate issue to discuss how the design of this refactoring to <code>wasi-common</code> might look, but now I think it could be discussed here, as a part of this issue. I would summarize this as: "wasi-threads and async cannot be enabled at the same time."

<blockquote>
<p>To clarify what I meant a bit about async/threads, my intention is to avoid the need for any large refactoring ideally. At a <code>Config</code> level we can implement a simplistic check that verifies <code>wasm_threads</code> and <code>async_support</code> are not both enabled. At the runtime layer for wiggle/wasi-common the goal would be "what's the smallest delta to support threads while not disturbing everything that's already there too much". I don't know the scale of the changes necessary, though, and I imagine that the implementation of <code>RwLock</code> and etc could have a large impact. In any case though I mostly wanted to outline that my reasoning is to avoid the need for refactorings unless necessary, I'm not trying to add undue work -- but at the same time recognizing that wiggle/wasi-common are used in production today and shouldn't regress from where they are.</p>
