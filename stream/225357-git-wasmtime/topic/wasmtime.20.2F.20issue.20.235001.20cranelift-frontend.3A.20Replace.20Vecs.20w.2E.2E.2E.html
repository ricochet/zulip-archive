<p>Thanks! I agree, that part was particularly subtle, which is why I wrote more comments there than anywhere else. :grin:</p>
<p>Also I think it's surprising how few tests fail if you iterate over the undefined variables in reverse order instead of forward order. I thought the obvious way to deal with parameters getting deleted was to iterate over them in reverse, and it took me a little while to discover that I was getting wrong answers. Apparently, most of the time, all the variables that are live between blocks have the same type, or at least their sequence of types match up when reversed, so the CLIF validator couldn't catch the problem.</p>
