<p>Now that wasmtime supports AOT I suggest you update the "about" section of this project as well as the tags.</p>
<p>For context, I didn't realize that wasmtime was supporting AOT until I went to the Lucet repo where they mentioned AOT support in wasmtime! It might be nice to mention that on the website and README, since the only mention I found was buried there: <a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/cli-options.html#compile">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/cli-options.html#compile</a> </p>
