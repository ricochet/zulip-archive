<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1928">PR #1928</a> from <code>c-api-docs</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit adds a bit of a skeleton of what it might look like to<br>
document the C API. Today the C API has virtually zero documentation<br>
because the upstream documentation does not exist and we haven't put a<br>
ton of effort into documenting our own extensions. Given that this is<br>
one of the main vectors we expect users to use Wasmtime, we should make<br>
sure it's thoroughly documented!</p>
<p>I've never really done much documentation generation of C myself before,<br>
but I did a bit of searching and Doxygen seems reasonable proficient for<br>
doing this. This commit sets up what it might look like for Doxygen to<br>
be used for the C API. One nice feature of DOxygen is that we can<br>
document the items in <code>wasm.h</code> without actually modifying <code>wasm.h</code>. For<br>
those purposes a <code>doc-wasm.h</code> file was added here which is where we can<br>
put Wasmtime-specific documentation about <code>wasm.h</code>.</p>
<p>There's quite a few functions in the C API so I didn't want to get them<br>
all done before getting consensus on this. I've started some skeletons<br>
of documentation for global types in <code>wasm.h</code> and also confirmed that<br>
documentation works for our own <code>wasmtime.h</code> and such header files. If<br>
this looks good to everyone and it runs reasonable well on CI then I can<br>
spend more time filling out the rest of the documentation.</p>

<p>It's worth pointing out that I generated this file with <code>doxygen -f doxygen.conf</code>. I've tweaked a number of settings internally but I'm hoping that most of this file can basically be ignored.</p>
