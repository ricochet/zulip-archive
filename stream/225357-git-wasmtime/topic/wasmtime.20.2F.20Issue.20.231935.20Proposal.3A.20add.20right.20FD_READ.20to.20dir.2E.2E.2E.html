<blockquote>
<p>This proposal tackles a situation where, given some directory handle, the user tries to open a subdirectory as a file, and invokes <code>fd_read</code> on the obtained WASI handle. This way, even though they obtained a valid handle from the <code>path_open</code> call (we don't have a way to tell the runtime to fail if the specified subpath is <em>not</em> a file; we can only fail if the subpath is not a directory and we specified the oflag <code>O_DIRECTORY</code>), the <code>fd_read</code> call will fail with <code>ENOTCAPABLE</code> errno since we don't include <code>FD_READ</code> right on directory handles when spawning them. In general, returning <code>ENOTCAPABLE</code> is fine, however, it doesn't match the common (expected?) behaviour of returning <code>EISDIR</code> in this case. Although, having said that, POSIX prescribes we should return <code>EPERM</code> rather than <code>EISDIR</code>. However, it seems that the Linux way of returning <code>EISDIR</code> is treated as standard. @sunfishcode please feel free to correct me here!</p>
<p>@sunfishcode and I had a discussion offline about this, and we both believe it would be reasonable to return <code>EISDIR</code> in this case in WASI as well. To achieve this, we would need to add <code>FD_READ</code> right to directory handles, and in the <code>fd_read</code> and <code>fd_pread</code> calls always return <code>EISDIR</code> errno. Having <code>FD_READ</code> right on the handle would prevent the implementation from failing with <code>ENOTCAPABLE</code> when verifying required rights on the handle.</p>
<p>I've decided to submit an issue about this first before rolling out a PR so that we can all agree if this is the right approach to the presented problem or not. The proposal if lands will introduce a breaking change to the end-user's code in that the expected errno values will change for the chain of syscalls described above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This seems like a reasonable approach to implementing the current interface. If we could kick this problem up to design changes in the WASI interfaces themselves, I would love some way to distinguish between directory handles and file handles in the type system so that doing file operations on a directory is caught as a type check rather than a capability check.</p>

<p>I agree with @pchickey; we should work towards having directories be a separate type, with separate rights, and make this a type error caught at runtime and translated by libc into <code>EISDIR</code>. But for now, using FD_READ seems a simple and unintrusive way to fix the immediate problem.</p>
