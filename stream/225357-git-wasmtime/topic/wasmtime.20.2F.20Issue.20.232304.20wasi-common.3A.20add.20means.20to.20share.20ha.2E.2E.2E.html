<blockquote>
<p>I agree there should be a facility to share handles across <code>WasiCtx</code>s. However, I'm not so sure that this is the correct approach.</p>
<p>The <code>EntryTable</code> is a map of capability handles (u32s) to capabilities (entries, which are always files at the moment, but will have lots of other types one day soon). This mapping needs to exist because wasm instances cannot yet use reference types, which can be used directly to implement capabilities. So, I think that it makes the most sense for an EntryTable to be used by only one single WasiCtx.</p>
<p>It is very desirable to share capabilities between different instances. I think we should expose the accessor, insertion, and deletion operations on a WasiCtx's entrytable as part of the WasiCtx api, so that the runtime can share a file between instances by getting it out of one wasictx and inserting it into another.</p>
<p>As an implementation note, I would prefer if entries were send and sync for multithreaded and async runtimes, so we'd want to use Arc instead of Rc, etc. A big part of my goals in #2205 is to get the scheduler abstraction modularized so it can be used in <code>async</code> rust, and I'll be adding support for async file read/write at some point soon as well.</p>

<p>I've modified the PR along those lines; would you check if this is acceptable? For testing purposes, I created a hypothetical <a href="https://github.com/ueno/wasi-shared-handles">memfd-like interface</a> based on this.</p>

<p>This looks exactly like what I was thinking, thanks.</p>
<p>Fwiw, since we had this conversation I embarked on a rewrite of wasi-common on top of <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/system-interface">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/system-interface</a> that has a similar architecture for tables. I think it will end up being compatible with what we have here, but permit the wasi table to contain directories and other sort of handles/capabilities (sockets, http, etc), instead of treating <code>Fd</code> as both file and directories. <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/pch/wasi_common_cap_std/crates/wasi-c2">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/pch/wasi_common_cap_std/crates/wasi-c2</a></p>
<p>This work is pretty incomplete, at the moment it is focused on fleshing out system-interface and cap-std to have all the facilities required to implement wasi, so that we can abandon the gnarly <code>wasi-common::sys</code> hierarchy in favor of those crates. It will eventually be merged into the wasi-common crate, but I found it easier to start from a clean slate for this sort of exploration.</p>

<p>I tried to <a href="https://github.com/ueno/wasmtime/tree/wip/dueno/wasi-c2-shared-handles">port</a> this PR to wasi-c2 and it seems to be indeed flexible; thank you for doing that! The usage <a href="https://github.com/ueno/wasi-shared-handles/commit/53bf5d1e5980caeb111fe11489ebe546f247e417">example</a> is also updated.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that before, but my motivation (for Enarx) is to allow Wasm modules to communicate through a secure connection (e.g. TLS, QUIC, VSOCK) dynamically established after WasiCtx is instantiated. Therefore I would like to see a couple of things on top of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>an abstraction of bi-directional channels, as I commented on the wasi-c2 PR</li>
<li>a way to override <code>poll_oneoff</code> behavior; I guess it would be possible through the <code>io::ReadReady</code> trait in system-interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://github.com/enarx/enarx-wasmldr/wiki/File-descriptor-setup-upon-deployment#option-34-have-the-runtime-issue-listen-and-pass-the-listening-file-descriptor-to-the-wasm-code-the-wasm-code-would-then-issue-either-poll-or-accept-on-the-listening-socket">background discussion</a> about these.</p>
<p>Having said that, is there any chance that this change to the current wasi-common will get merged, so the approach can be (partially) experimented before wasi-c2 becomes ready?</p>

<p>Thanks for investigating how everything will work in the wasi-c2 paradigm. It is very validating to hear that it is working for you :). </p>
<p>Bi-directional channels should be implementable as a crate via impls of the <code>WasiFile</code> trait. There's no reason that the existing <code>ReadPipe</code> and <code>WritePipe</code> code lives in the wasi-c2 crate at the moment besides convenience. I'll probably move it out at some point to make the boundaries clearer. And indeed even the impl of the <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits in terms of <code>cap-std::fs</code> should be possible to do in an external crate.</p>
<p>The remaining major goal I had when I started this rewrite was making the <code>poll_oneoff</code> behavior extensible by way of <code>async</code> Rust. My current plan is to land wasi-c2 (by deleting wasi-common and then renaming wasi-c2 to wasi-common) with only the existing synchronous (<code>poll_oneoff</code> implemented by <code>select(2)</code>) behavior, and work on the adaptation to optionally use <code>async</code> as a follow-up PR. The biggest stumbling block is that we don't want to make every <code>wasi-common</code> user also take a dep on <code>tokio</code>, so any async functionality we build will have to be opt-in.</p>
