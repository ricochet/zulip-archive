<p>I am trying to write my own <code>LinearMemory</code> implementation. The issue that I am facing is that it appears the <code>as_ptr</code> function is inherently incompatible with the <code>Sync</code> trait bound.</p>
<p>In essence, <code>as_ptr</code> allows interior mutability, since it's a <code>&amp;self</code> function that returns a <code>mut</code> pointer to data owned by the memory. Interior mutability is explicitly not <code>Sync</code>, though. </p>
<p>Assume <code>T: LinearMemory</code>. It must also be <code>Sync</code>, so <code>&amp;T</code> must be safely shareable between threads. However, then two threads can call <code>as_ptr</code>, _which is a safe function_, and obtain <code>*mut T</code>. At that point we're sharing mutable pointers concurrently and all bets are off. So any useful <code>T</code> cannot be <code>Sync</code> in my mind.</p>
<p>As far as I can grok what the runtime is doing with the memory, it only uses <code>LinearMemory</code> implementations from a single thread as long as wasm threading and <code>SharedMemory</code> is not involved. So it kinda seems like I am required to lie to the Rust compiler that my type is <code>Sync</code> and then trust <code>wasmtime</code> that it will not do anything nasty with it.</p>
<p>I looked at the implementation of <code>MmapMemory</code> used by the actual runtime, and underneath in <code>sys::unix::mmap::Mmap</code> you just wrap the raw pointer in <code>SendSyncPtr</code> and pretend it's <code>Sync</code>, so I am assuming that this is what would be expected from someone implementing <code>LinearMemory</code> from the outside as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First, am I even correct above or is there something I'm missing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're both correct and incorrect a bit, I can try to help clear this up a bit. I'll note that I'm no expert in <code>unsafe</code> Rust so what follows is my own personal understanding. I may have some exact specifics slightly off, but I think the high-level is right.</p>
<p>To Rust <code>*const T</code> and <code>*mut T</code> are the same in terms of semantic guarantees. You can read from both and while the compiler requires <code>*mut T</code> to write you can <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.cast_mut">safely cast <code>*const T</code> to <code>*mut T</code></a> so you can sort of write through a <code>*const T</code> as well. In that sense when you say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At that point we're sharing mutable pointers concurrently and all bets are off</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that this is incorrect. If we were talking about <code>&amp;mut T</code> then I believe your statement is correct, but <code>*mut T</code> is different in this regard.</p>
<p>The way I sort of think of it is that <code>&amp;mut T</code> is statically safe and <code>*mut T</code> must be "runtime safe". When a <code>*mut T</code> is mutated it must, at that time, be the only mutator. When <code>*mut T</code> isn't actually being accessed though you can have as many floating around as you'd like.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could we get this documented in LinearMemory to guide implementors?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely makes sense to me to improve the documentation here! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, is it correct to assume that as_ptr will never be called from different threads on the same instance if wasm threads and shared memory are not involved?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer this: probably not. The <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html#method.data"><code>Memory::data</code></a> API only requires <code>&amp;Store&lt;T&gt;</code> which means that it can be called concurrently on many threads. This exact API does not literally call <code>LinearMemory::as_ptr</code> but it theoretically could from the runtime's perspective. So you shouldn't rely on being only called on one thread at a time, even when wasm threads aren't involved.</p>
<p>Note, though, that you can create <code>*mut u8</code> from <code>&amp;[u8]</code> via <code>foo.as_ptr().cast_mut()</code> in safe Rust.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can this Sync requirement be lifted altogether?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. </p>
<p>The reasoning here is a little nuanced, but the main idea is that everything about <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> is required to make anything about <code>wasmtime::Store&lt;T&gt;</code> both <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>. Note, however, that <code>Sync</code> does not mean "no interior mutability" nor "no mutation". For example <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> is <code>Sync</code> despite allowing mutation, explicitly because all mutation requires <code>&amp;mut T</code>. Also note that types like <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>AtomicUsize</code> are both <code>Sync</code> while allowing interior mutation.</p>
<hr>
<p>That's a lot of words, but my hunch is it won't be the most satisfying answer to you. I'm more than happy to keep answering questions though! We can also chat on Zulip for something a little less async if you'd like too.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, but that is precisely my point -- the thing that makes these types safe is that they don't have an API that's just "turn a <code>&amp;self</code> into a mutable pointer". For example, <code>Mutex</code> gives you a guard whose lifetime is the same as <code>&amp;self</code> that ensures thread-safety. But doing something like that with <code>LinearMemory</code> is impossible.

<p>Let me rephrase my questions to hopefully make this discussion productive :) I'm mostly interested in being able to be reasonable sure that my implementation of <code>LinearMemory</code> isn't going to cause undefined behaviour. Here is what _I believe_ to be the complete list of things that might cause multiple threads to mutably access my <code>T: LinearMemory</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>I use <code>T</code> in my code myself and share it between threads and then do nasty stuff with it.</li>
<li>I use <code>wasmtime</code> with multi-threaded wasm code, in which case obviously thread-unsafety in the wasm being ran will result in thread-unsafety in the shared memory.</li>
<li>I misuse the <code>Memory</code> API in my own code, for example holding mutable accesses across wasm calls, or other things that are already listed in the <code>Memory</code> docs as unsafe.</li>
</ol>
<p>Crucially, note that 1. and 3. are completely "my problems", i.e. I can audit my own code to detect violations of those. Point 2. is a natural consequence of running arbitrary wasm code, but it also carries an implication that if I were to audit all wasm code that runs I would prevent violations.</p>
<p>In other words it'd be good to get some strong guarantee from <code>wasmtime</code> about how exactly the memory will be used, and put it explicitly on <code>LinearMemory</code> docs. Then I could audit my code for violations of the contract and be relatively certain there won't be UB creeping up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are good points, and if you're up for it I'd be happy to review a PR of docs for <code>LinearMemory</code>! Reviewing some code we may not actually end up using <code>LinearMemory</code> implementations for wasm shared memory with wasm threads, but that's sort of a bug in Wasmtime where the intention is that they're still used. I think this is just an oversight.</p>
<p>Otherwise though you're correct that (2) is the main Wasmtime-related thing to guarantee here, and yes custom memories when used with wasm threads can be mutated by wasm in multiple threads. It might be worth clarifying though that <code>as_ptr(&amp;self) -&gt; *mut T</code>, when called, does not represent an intent-to-mutate. It's possible to mutate with <code>unsafe</code> code but part of that contract of the <code>unsafe</code> is that it's done safely with respect to other mutations.</p>
<p>What I can say, though, is that if you're not dealing with shared memory then, yes, Wasmtime guarantees that mutations to memory will happen in at most one thread at a time. That's guaranteed by the nature of requiring <code>&amp;mut Store&lt;T&gt;</code> whenever the memory is mutated and that mutable borrow serves as proof of "I'm the thread allowed to mutate right now"</p>
