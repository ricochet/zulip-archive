<blockquote>
<p>&lt;!-- Please try to describe precisely what you would like to do in<br>
Cranelift/Wasmtime and/or expect from it. You can answer the questions below if<br>
they're relevant and delete this text before submitting. Thanks for opening an<br>
issue! --&gt;</p>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>RELRO is a security feature that makes as much sections as possible readonly after performing dynamic relocations.<br>
&lt;!-- What is the feature or code improvement you would like to do in<br>
Cranelift/Wasmtime? --&gt;</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>Improved security.<br>
&lt;!-- What is the value of adding this in Cranelift/Wasmtime? --&gt;</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>Cranelift will need to get a PIC mode that doesn't use a PLT, but only a GOT. Then cranelift-object will need to be changed to use <code>.data.rel.ro</code> instead of <code>.data</code> for relocatable readonly data objects. There may be other steps necessary. This should all be optional.</p>
<p>&lt;!-- Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>
algorithms to use? --&gt;</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>Not implementing this and thus having a bit less security.<br>
&lt;!-- Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they<br>
better or worse than your proposal? --&gt;</p>
