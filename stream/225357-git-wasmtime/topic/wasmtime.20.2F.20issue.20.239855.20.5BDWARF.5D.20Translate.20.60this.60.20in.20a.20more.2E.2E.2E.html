<blockquote>
<p>Currently, for instance methods, <code>this</code> pointers are translated like all other pointers - wrapped in the synthetic types. However, this breaks LLDB's ability to do anything with them as it expects <code>this</code> to be a proper pointer.</p>
<p>(There are still ways to inspect the underlying data, of course, but they're more clunky than just <code>p Member</code>.)</p>
<p>The proposed fix, consistent with the existing system, would be to rename <code>this</code> and effectively transform all instance methods into static ones.</p>
<p>The user experience would then be <code>p __this-&gt;Member</code> instead of <code>p Member</code>.</p>
<p>A more ambitious alternative is to translate it into a proper pointer. Unlike for a number of other cases, we _can_ do that (since we have the frame context available), but it's a bit more complicated (need to intelligently intersect ranges of <code>__vmctx</code> with those of <code>this</code>) and more importantly, it wouldn't be consistent with how the rest of the system operates.</p>
