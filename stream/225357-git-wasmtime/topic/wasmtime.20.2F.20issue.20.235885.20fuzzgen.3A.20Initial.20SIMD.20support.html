<p>I'm not entirely sure I like writing vector constants as large hexadecimal numbers, but it does seem to be the most expedient option here and is apparently rarely used anyway. So let's go with it and maybe we can figure something better out later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds good. I'm happy to iterate on this syntax as well. From what I've read of the parser we support a few different forms:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">const0</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">i32x4</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">0x0123456</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="n">const1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">i64x2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">const2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mh">0x00</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">0x01</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">0x02</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is pre-this-pr, I've only changed the <code>const2</code> syntax into big hex. Ideally we could print the <code>const1</code> format, but that one does require us knowing the type of the const data. Which I don't think we have when printing the CLIF back out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm eager to get the codegen-meta all-opcodes fuzzing stuff going, but I'd still be happy to approve PRs adding more ops to the existing table. I'd like to have as much coverage from fuzzing as possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that makes sense! I'm going to review whats already supported in the interpreter and add those ops to the fuzzer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and I expect it's going to be tricky to get the code-generated version working, so I'm assuming we won't finish that soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last I looked into it, I ran into some kind of blocker, but I don't actually remember what it was. I'll need to go look into it again.</p>
