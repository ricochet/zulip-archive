<p>kubkon opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1395" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1395">PR #1395</a> from <code>mut-cleanup</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until now, several syscalls including <code>fd_pwrite</code> etc. were relying on mutating <code>&amp;mut Entry</code> by mutating its inner file handle. This is unnecessary in almost all cases since all methods mutating <code>std::fs::File</code> in Rust's libstd are also implemented for <code>&amp;std::fs::File</code>. In part, this will prepare us to handle <code>Entry</code>s behind an <code>Rc</code> and <code>RefCell</code> combo.</p>
<p>While here, I've also modified <code>OsHandle</code> in BSD to include <code>RefCell&lt;Option&lt;Dir&gt;&gt;</code> rather than <code>Option&lt;Mutex&lt;Dir&gt;&gt;</code> as was until now. While <code>RefCell</code> could easily be replaced with <code>RefCell</code>, since going multithreading will require a lot of (probably even) conceptual changes to <code>wasi-common</code>, I thought it'd be best not to mix single- with multithreading contexts and swap all places at once when it comes to it. If y'all feel this is not the right approach, lemme know!</p>
<p>I've also had to make some modifications to virtual FS which mainly swapped mutability for interior mutability in places.</p>
