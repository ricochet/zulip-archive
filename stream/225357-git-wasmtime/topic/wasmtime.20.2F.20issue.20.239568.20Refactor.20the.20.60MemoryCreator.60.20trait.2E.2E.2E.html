<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/9568">issue #9568</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In #NNNN the <code>memory_may_move</code> configuration knob was plumbed into memories themselves to limit the growth of the memory. This knob is not surfaced in the custom <code>MemoryCreator</code> trait, however, and memories created from that trait are pessimistically assumed to always possibly move in memory. This issue is intended to track refactoring this trait to improve this situation and enable plumbing the information a bit further.</p>
<p>Ideally the <code>MemoryCreator</code> and <code>RuntimeMemoryCreator</code> traits are merged. After looking at this for a bit this'll require some deeper refactoring to keep things making sense. </p>
