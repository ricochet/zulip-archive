<blockquote>
<p>In #4163, we have an alias analysis that right now we will use to eliminate redundant loads.</p>
<p>However, in principle we could also eliminate dead stores -- stores that are not observed and that are known to be overwritten by some other store, hence completely invisible.</p>
<p>This is quite a bit more complicated in a world where traps exist and precise state must be observed at the trap point (and where the store itself can trap); so we should carefully evaluate whether this is actually worth it, and whether much opportunity exists under these constraints. But it may still be worthwhile.</p>
<p>We will at least need to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The store can be proved not to trap (e.g., another access to the same memory category dominates this store, with the same or a greater address/offset);</li>
<li>There is another store to the same address that postdominates this store (all paths from this store go through the postdominating aliasing store eventually);</li>
<li>No loads observe, or even may observe, the store (no loads in the same memory category);</li>
<li>No trapping instructions, calls, or fences/atomics between the store and the shadowing store.</li>
</ul>
