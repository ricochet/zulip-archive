<blockquote>
<p>I'm developing a plugin system for a database system in production to run untrusted user code as UDF similar to the one mentioned in [1].</p>
<p>I noticed that compared to Google's V8 js engine mentioned in the above-mentioned paper, wasmtime has a focus to be used in the environment outside of a browser. Thus, I'm more interested in embedding wasmtime than V8 in my application.</p>
<p>I noticed that there does not seem to be well-known industrial usage of wasmtime (compared to V8's use in Chromium and Cloudflare edge workers), but it seems to have experienced a fair amount of fuzzing[2], so I am wondering is wasmtime considered production-ready in the aspect of both reliability and performance?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>As a newbie of Rust, I'm also quite worried about the vast dependencies of wasmtime and the possibility of a supply chain attack.</p>
