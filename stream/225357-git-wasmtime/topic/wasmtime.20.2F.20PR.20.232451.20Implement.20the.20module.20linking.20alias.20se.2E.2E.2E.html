<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2451">PR #2451</a> from <code>alias-section</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit is intended to do almost everything necessary for processing<br>
the alias section of module linking. Most of this is internal<br>
refactoring, the highlights being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type contents are now stored separately from a <code>wasmtime_env::Module</code>.<br>
  Given that modules can freely alias types and have them used all over<br>
  the place, it seemed best to have one canonical location to type<br>
  storage which everywhere else points to (with indices). A new<br>
<code>TypeTables</code> structure is produced during compilation which is shared<br>
  amongst all member modules in a wasm blob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instantiation is heavily refactored to account for module linking. The<br>
  main gotcha here is that imports are now listed as "initializers". We<br>
  have a sort of pseudo-bytecode-interpreter which interprets the<br>
  initialization of a module. This is more complicated than just<br>
  matching imports at this point because in the module linking proposal<br>
  the module, alias, import, and instance sections may all be<br>
  interleaved. This means that imports aren't guaranteed to show up at<br>
  the beginning of the address space for modules/instances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise most of the changes here largely fell out from these two<br>
design points. Aliases are recorded as initializers in this scheme.<br>
Copying around type information and/or just knowing type information<br>
during compilation is also pretty easy since everything is just a<br>
pointer into a <code>TypeTables</code> and we don't have to actually copy any types<br>
themselves. Lots of various refactorings were necessary to accomodate<br>
these changes.</p>
<p>Tests are hoped to cover a breadth of functionality here, but not<br>
necessarily a depth. There's still one more piece of the module linking<br>
proposal missing which is exporting instances/modules, which will come<br>
in a future PR.</p>
<p>It's also worth nothing that there's one large TODO which isn't<br>
implemented in this change that I plan on opening an issue for.<br>
With module linking when a set of modules comes back from compilation<br>
each modules has all the trampolines for the entire set of modules. This<br>
is quite a lot of duplicate trampolines across module-linking modules.<br>
We'll want to refactor this at some point to instead have only one set<br>
of trampolines per set of module linking modules and have them shared<br>
from there. I figured it was best to separate out this change, however,<br>
since it's purely related to resource usage, and doesn't impact<br>
non-module-linking modules at all.</p>

<p>alexcrichton updated <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2451">PR #2451</a> from <code>alias-section</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit is intended to do almost everything necessary for processing<br>
the alias section of module linking. Most of this is internal<br>
refactoring, the highlights being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type contents are now stored separately from a <code>wasmtime_env::Module</code>.<br>
  Given that modules can freely alias types and have them used all over<br>
  the place, it seemed best to have one canonical location to type<br>
  storage which everywhere else points to (with indices). A new<br>
<code>TypeTables</code> structure is produced during compilation which is shared<br>
  amongst all member modules in a wasm blob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instantiation is heavily refactored to account for module linking. The<br>
  main gotcha here is that imports are now listed as "initializers". We<br>
  have a sort of pseudo-bytecode-interpreter which interprets the<br>
  initialization of a module. This is more complicated than just<br>
  matching imports at this point because in the module linking proposal<br>
  the module, alias, import, and instance sections may all be<br>
  interleaved. This means that imports aren't guaranteed to show up at<br>
  the beginning of the address space for modules/instances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise most of the changes here largely fell out from these two<br>
design points. Aliases are recorded as initializers in this scheme.<br>
Copying around type information and/or just knowing type information<br>
during compilation is also pretty easy since everything is just a<br>
pointer into a <code>TypeTables</code> and we don't have to actually copy any types<br>
themselves. Lots of various refactorings were necessary to accomodate<br>
these changes.</p>
<p>Tests are hoped to cover a breadth of functionality here, but not<br>
necessarily a depth. There's still one more piece of the module linking<br>
proposal missing which is exporting instances/modules, which will come<br>
in a future PR.</p>
<p>It's also worth nothing that there's one large TODO which isn't<br>
implemented in this change that I plan on opening an issue for.<br>
With module linking when a set of modules comes back from compilation<br>
each modules has all the trampolines for the entire set of modules. This<br>
is quite a lot of duplicate trampolines across module-linking modules.<br>
We'll want to refactor this at some point to instead have only one set<br>
of trampolines per set of module linking modules and have them shared<br>
from there. I figured it was best to separate out this change, however,<br>
since it's purely related to resource usage, and doesn't impact<br>
non-module-linking modules at all.</p>
