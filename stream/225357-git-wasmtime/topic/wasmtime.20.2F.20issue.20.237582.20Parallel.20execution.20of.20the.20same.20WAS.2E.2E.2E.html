<blockquote>
<p>I've made a C host for WASM reactor modules using Wasmtime, the problem that I'm trying to solve is calling <code>wasmtime_func_call()</code> for the same instance of a WASM module simultaneously from two threads. For instance on my host's main thread I'll call a function of the WASM module to generate graphics while from an audio callback I'll call a function of the same instance of the same WASM module to generate sound.</p>
<p>The problem is that Wasmtime doesn't like this and after a few seconds of working correctly I either get a panic from Wasmtime or even a <code>0xC0000005: Access violation reading location</code> from the host crashing.</p>
<p>Is there a known way to execute functions from the same WASM module instance in parallel? If not is there a way to have shared memory between two different instances of the same module using the C API?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A <code>wasmtime_store_t</code> cannot be shared across threads (although it can be sent between threads when it's not in use), so invoking two functions within the same instance/store is not safe and is undefined behavior. In theory the documentation covers this, but if it doesn't we should fix that! This would be a compile error in Rust, for example.</p>
<p>The closest approximation at this time is to use shared WebAssembly memories at this time. You'd create a single WebAssembly instance per thread (one store per thread), and all the instances would import a shared linear memory. This requires a lot of coordination in both the guest and the host at this time so it's a relatively advanced thing to do and requires a fair bit of knowledge of how everything works. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you, I didn't know this about how <code>wasmtime_store_t</code> works, but I just noticed that <code>store.h</code> says <code>A store generally cannot be concurrently used</code>. Will it always be like this?</p>
<p>It doesn't look like importing a shared memory is at all possible with the C API at the moment, that's rather limiting. However as far as I'm concerned that's ok, I can send commands to the host to fill any gap, I can create a command to do mutex-protected buffer synchronisation across instances, this is not optimal in terms of performance but at least that's foolproof and doesn't require anything sophisticated from Wasmtime nor WASI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's not planned to enable concurrent access within a <code>wasmtime_store_t</code> in the future, no. There are possible changes in upstream WebAssembly which might affect this but those are a long way away at this point.</p>
<p>Also yes the C API lags a bit behind the Rust API, so shared memories may not be exposed yet. If you'd like though a PR would be welcome to support shared memories in the C API.</p>
