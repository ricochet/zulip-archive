<p>Personally I do not want to organize the repository like this. I don't think it's useful to have this copied all over the place and even with CI checking it that just seems like it'll be more annoying than anything else.</p>
<p>IIRC Cargo does processing of a <code>license-file</code> directive and puts it into the root crate, so could that be investigated instead of copying the files around?</p>

<p>I tend to agree, but downstream packagers want this -- @decathorpe in #3761 needs LICENSE files in each crate (or at least the published ones) for packaging in Fedora (IIRC?).</p>
<p>@decathorpe, would it be acceptable instead to <em>remove</em> all LICENSE files except for the root one, and then update your packaging setup to refer to that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I understand correctly, "license-file" is only supposed to be used when using a non-standard license, i.e. the two fields in Cargo.toml are mutually exclusive:</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields">https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields</a></p>
<p>Concerning inclusion of the license text in individual crates: Lawyers / people who understand licenses better than me explained it this way: Some software licenses (including Apache-2.0 and MIT, the de-facto standard licenses for Rust projects), include a requirement that redistributed sources MUST contain a copy of the actual license text (i.e. the LICENSE file).</p>
<p>So, since you are _redistributing_ this project as individual crates on <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a> (and subsequently, Linux distributions might create and redistribute packages for those crates), they need to include license file(s) to be in compliance with the license that you yourselves have chosen for your project.</p>
<p>It also looks like you added copies of the LICENSE files in some places where they are actually not needed (for example, workspace directories that don't contain crates, or "internal" crates that are not published individually).</p>
<p>And, assuming that the operating system that "cargo publish" is run on for this project supports symbolic links, you don't actually need to include full copies of the file everywhere, but a symbolic link is sufficient for cargo to include it.</p>

<p>I understand that <code>license</code> and <code>license-file</code> are typically mutally exclusive.

<p>Our tooling for creating RPM packages <em>does</em> read the <code>package.license</code> value from Cargo.toml, and uses that value to populate the License field of packages.</p>
<p>But even if that were not the case, and the license string was determined by asking an oracle, the problem is the missing license <strong>text / file</strong>:</p>
<p>c.f. <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/">https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/</a> at 4. Redistribution, (a):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't see a distinction between redistribution via <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a> and redistribution by linux distributions here (other than the fact that in the first case, you're violating your own license terms, while in the second case, it usually prevents linux distributions from redistributing your code), so the problem is definitely not specific to Linux distribution packages.</p>

<p>@decathorpe I've modified this PR to add LICENSE files just to the six (!) crates we have added recently without LICENSE files, and to add a check to the <code>publish.rs</code> script that runs in our CI to verify publishability.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it looks like <code>wasi-nn</code> is missing a LICENSE file as well, and that's an upstream repo that would need a separate PR to fix and then a PR here to pull in a new submodule version. Would you be willing to do that legwork? If that's merged then CI here should pass and hopefully we can merge this.</p>

<p>@decathorpe could you respond to the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately it looks like wasi-nn is missing a LICENSE file as well, and that's an upstream repo that would need a separate PR to fix and then a PR here to pull in a new submodule version. Would you be willing to do that legwork? If that's merged then CI here should pass and hopefully we can merge this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I unfortunately can't spend much more time on this either but if you are willing to drive this with the above effort, then I can rebase this and merge when that's done. Thanks!</p>

<p>Sorry, I missed that one.</p>
<p>I can try, but I'm not really interested in wasi-nn as it's dependencies don't look like they'd be available to be.</p>
<p>More important is wasi-common, which also has a problem like this, and it's been ignored for a while: <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3912">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3912</a></p>

<p>I'm cleaning up old PRs and am going to go ahead and close this for now; this has become out-of-date anyway (new crates in the meantime). @decathorpe please feel free to recreate a new version of the PR as you see fit.</p>
