<p>elliottt opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4976">PR #4976</a> from <code>trevor/stable-overlap-error-output</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were finding rules with the most overlap errors by traversing the hash map, but weren't doing anything to prevent the unstable order of the hash map elements from affecting the error output order. This PR includes the rule id when looking for rules that have the largest number of overlaps, to break ties predictably.<br>
