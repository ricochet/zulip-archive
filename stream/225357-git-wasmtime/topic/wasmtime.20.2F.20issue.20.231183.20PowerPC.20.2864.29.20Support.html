<blockquote>
<p>I haven't started working on this yet, we're currently focusing on getting Libre-SOC's ISA extensions into the next version of PowerISA so I don't plan on working on this in the next few months. When we do start adding compiler support, we're working on LLVM/GCC first, so Cranelift will have to wait. I did do some experimentation with writing a register allocator (no, the current register allocator is insufficient for SVP64, though it will probably work fine for scalar PowerISA) so we can put our SVP64 vector extension into Cranelift, but that's currently on indefinite hold.</p>
<p>If you do want to implement PowerISA support in Cranelift, please be aware that POWER9/10 are not the only modern cpus that people will want to run, so don't necessarily assume VMX/VSX is supported (Libre-SOC cpus will be supporting SVP64 instead, and the <a href="https://www.powerpc-notebook.org/en/">PowerPC Open Hardware Notebook</a> doesn't support VMX/VSX in Little-Endian mode) and especially don't confuse ISA v3.0/v3.1 support as being equivalent  to POWER9/10 support, those are separate things (e.g. Libre-SOC cpus will support ISA v3.1 or probably even v3.2 but won't have the same feature set as whatever POWER cpu is released next). Thanks!</p>

<p>My understanding, correct me if I'm wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>SVP64 is an extension to POWER ISA, which includes scalar part from standard POWER, and implemented vectors using scalar registers, totally incompatible with Altivec/VSX. (this also means the regalloc would be quite different)</li>
<li>LLVM already differentiates those features. For example, <code>power9-vector</code> controls new VSX instructions introduced in POWER9, while <code>isa-v30-instructions</code> controls other scalar instructions introducec in POWER9. As I know, Linux kernel was built with Altivec disabled.</li>
<li>So, I expect Cranelift to have ability to control target features. If so, something like <code>target-cpu=xxx</code> or <code>target-features=xxx</code> can switch Altivec/VSX on or off, but enabled by default for a standard <code>powerpc64le-unknown-linux-gnu</code> target. (not sure how SVP64 will define its triple)</li>

<p>it is not totally incompatible (a cpu can implement both), but is totally independent of VSX/VMX, with what happens when you try to use SVP64 prefixing on a VSX instruction not being currently defined beyond just being an illegal instruction trap.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that's good. the reason I was mentioning this is because a lot of recent PowerPC software uses <code>#ifdef POWER9</code> (e.g. glibc iirc) to enable v3.0 instructions, not realizing that non-POWER9/10 cpus can also use them.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>iirc the plan is tentatively to be something like <code>powerpc64lesffs-unknown-linux-gnu</code> since SFFS is the name the PowerISA uses for that conformance class. the SVP64 extension(s) are enabled separately, like how AVX512F is on x86.</p>

<p>Clang does not have any macros indicating POWER ISA version now. A workaround is to check <code>defined(_ARCH_PWR9) &amp;&amp; !defined(__ALTIVEC__)</code>.</p>

<p>note that a future version of SVP64 may define what happens when combining SVP64 prefixing with VSX/VMX -- it's probably relatively straightforward but we have no funding for that work.</p>

<p>simple initial support, I do not need performance, just to have it <br>
running on this architecture.<br>
yes, PPC scalar, 64 bit, LE, linux, ELFv2 ABI seems perfect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For a few more pieces of anecdata: basic RISC-V (integer/FP only, no SIMD, not too many opts) took about three months in review and was ~21k lines of code. Back in 2020 I built the aarch64 backend to a similar level in about that time as well. For the level of completeness that we hope for with a good backend, SIMD, reasonable optimizations, reasonable confidence in correctness, etc., I'd expect around six compiler-engineer-months of fulltime work and the backend would likely be around ~30kLoC.</p>
<p>I'll note our <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/docs/stability-tiers.md">tiers</a> as well: a new backend would arrive at tier 3, which allows for some amount of "work-in-progress" or incompleteness in-tree but does expect ongoing involvement and responsiveness to issues. (E.g., tail-call support recently had architecture-specific work for each backend and some of our maintainers pitched in.) Partly this is inspired by our experience with a partial arm32 backend, which we had to delete because no one was around to maintain or finish it. In other words, we want to make sure that the ongoing maintenance is properly factored in.</p>
<p>All that is not to discourage anything -- we would absolutely love to have this! -- just to ensure that the proper level of serious commitment is there, as it's not a small undertaking.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>many thanks for more effort estimation. Exactly what needed, and well <br>
aware of what happens if underestimated. That is why I asked, will check <br>
internally what are our possibilities.</p>
<p>one question though. is it possible to use QEMU to test? I quickly <br>
tried, but none of the supported ports passed all tests.</p>
<p>regards,<br>

<blockquote>
<p>The tests are routinely run under qemu in CI and should pass on all supported platforms, but due to how qemu handles memory allocation some configurations don't work, so we have an environment variable to disable those configurations that we use when testing under qemu. If you set <code>WASMTIME_TEST_NO_HOG_MEMORY=1</code> the tests should pass.</p>

<p>Hi @matevy is there some progress on this?</p>
<p>If so, feel free to share the implementation to get public comments. (the work may be incomplete as of now but that's totally fair)</p>

<p>It looks like more or less a full copy of the aarch64 backend, with find-replace ("copy-n-rename" as @ecnelises noted above); I was curious if there were any e.g. instruction emission definitions for PPC but I didn't see anything in the diff that looked PPC-specific?</p>
<p>to both @ecnelises and @rjzak -- there's enough complexity in the fully-developed backends now that I think I might suggest a "mostly clean slate" approach instead; I'd probably develop things by:</p>
<ul>
<li>deleting all lowering rules in lower.isle, and all inst helpers in inst.isle, and all auxiliary struct/enum definitions for inst arguments etc, and strip out all ABI code so it doesn't reference the now-deleted instructions (i.e., get down to a true skeleton, rather than a full copy);</li>
<li>define the registers and the MachineEnv in <a href="http://regs.rs">regs.rs</a>;</li>
<li>define the basic instructions you know you'll need in the MInst enum in inst.isle, and write emission code and emission tests for them (things like move, load, store, add, jump);</li>
<li>write lowering rules that use these, and write some basic CLIF compile tests;</li>
<li>fill in ABI code with the appropriate register choices and stack-frame details;</li>
<li>at this point, get some really basic ISA runtests working (return x+y, fibonacci, if/else, that sort of thing);</li>
<li>then burn down the list of Wasm spec tests and existing CLIF runtests until you've got everything implemented, adding instructions as you need them. (The instruction emission code doesn't need to know the whole ISA, just the subset you use)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's probably easier than starting from a full copy of a production backend and trying to make a pass over it, or similar. We're happy to answer questions on Zulip as you have them!</p>
