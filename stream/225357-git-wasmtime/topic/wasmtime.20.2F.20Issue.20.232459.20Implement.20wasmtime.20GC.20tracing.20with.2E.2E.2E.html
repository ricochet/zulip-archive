<blockquote>
<p>In wasmtime, GC tracing of reftype pointers currently works by using <code>libunwind</code> to iterate over stack frames, fetching a stackmap for each relevant PC and finding the stack slots with live pointers.</p>
<p>This works perfectly fine, but is potentially slower than we would like, because <code>libunwind</code> relies on DWARF info to understand stack frames. It is also more complex -- it relies on DWARF generation and interpretation to be correct -- which increases risk a little because GC-tracing bugs can lead to various security issues.</p>
<p>In contrast, many other high-performance JITs use explicit data structures of some sort on the stack so that tracing stack roots boils down to walking a linked list of some sort. For example, SpiderMonkey has a strict <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/168c45a7acc44e9904cfd4eebcb9eb080e05699c/js/src/wasm/WasmFrameIter.h#50-57">JIT-frame discipline allowing fast iteration</a> (different from the system ABI), and V8 indirects object references through <code>InstanceHandle</code>s that link themselves into a list on the thread context.</p>
<p>We should look into designing a mechanism that maintains a stack of frames reachable from the <code>vmctx</code> and walkable without any metadata (aside from the stackmaps). Two options that come to mind are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain a shadow stack (with top and limit pointers in <code>vmctx</code>) of <code>(stackmap, SP)</code> tuples. On function entry, allocate a tuple. At every safepoint, ensure that the stack pointer and stackmap for that safepoint are up-to-date in the tuple. Walking the stack for GC roots then simply requires (i) looping over these tuples, and (ii) tracing references at offsets indicated by the stackmap.</li>
</ol>
<p>The advantage of this scheme is that it is a relatively small delta from today's implementation. It requires inserting code at prologue and epilogue/returns to alloc/dealloc the tuple, and at every safepoint to store the stackmap pointer and SP value.</p>
<p>Two disadvantages of this scheme are that (i) the stackmap pointer would have to be indirected somehow; we cannot bake the raw pointer value into the code if the code is cached on disk; and (ii) it will slightly increase memory traffic at every safepoint, as in addition to the spills of all references inserted by the register allocator, we have to store stackmap and SP pointers.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Maintain a shadow stack that actually stores spilled references. On function entry, bounds-check that there is enough shadow-stack space for the maximal live-set of reftyped values at any safepoint in the function (this is statically known). At any safepoint, push all live reftyped values to the shadow stack; after the safepoint, restore them (if we implement a moving GC that may edit pointers) or bulk-pop them by bumping the top pointer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The advantages of this scheme are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is independent of reftypes support in Cranelift and <code>regalloc.rs</code>; in other words, it is very simple and easy to verify. While we are pretty confident in the reftypes implementation at least in the backtracking allocator at this point, less complexity is always good; and it lowers the bar for adopting other register allocators in the future, if we choose to do that.</li>
<li>Tracing will be as fast as possible; we literally provide the GC with a <code>&amp;[PointerT]</code> (slice of contiguous live pointers). This is even better than walking a potentially sparse stackmap looking for set bits.</li>
<li>It has no additional memory traffic relative to the status quo (what we do today) unless a reftyped value was already spilled; we are simply replacing regalloc spills with stores to our shadow stack.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>One advantage of both of these schemes that I missed above is:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is zero overhead for any frame that has no reference-typed values. Such frames simply don't appear in the shadow stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus this will likely be an additional performance improvement (on top of faster stack-walking) in code that only <em>sparsely</em> uses reference types.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other purpose of dwarf-based unwinding is that we can get a full stack trace on traps, but I think most developers generally expect traps to be slow-ish and not used in performance-sensitive code. In that sense if the main concern here is gc of references and correctness we can focus on just solving that one problem rather than a more general problem of reconstructing the call stack. This is what both proposed solutions basically do (assuming in the first the push is elided if the frame has no stack map), but figured I'd point it out!</p>
<p>One possible way to optimize your first thought would be to first assign a constant number to all stack maps (perhaps function-local too, so when compiling a function we know what number a stack map gets). The linked list entry would then contain a previous pointer, the function's global number, the stack pointer (which presumably doesn't change during function execution), and a slot for the local number within a function. Then when a safepoint happens we'd update the local number slot but that's it, ideally keeping traffic pretty low? (and this would also avoid baking in pointers and it'd be up to the stack walker to translate indices to actual stack maps). This could also presumably all be skipped for functions having no reference types.</p>
<p>I would personally lean towards as little complexity as possible, though, so option 2 sounds pretty good to me as well. One extra possible cost though is that the base pointer of the shadow stack to push to would need to be recalculated after each function call in case the function call relocated it. That may be unconditional new memory traffic we can't get away from?</p>

<p>Indeed, for maximal clarity I should point out that I wouldn't expect <code>libunwind</code> usage or DWARF info to go away at all; rather, this is just decoupling GC, as you say. Though removing one dependency on the DWARF info <em>might</em> allow us to omit it if GC was the only reason it was generated (i.e., user does not care about debugging or trap callstacks), so could save some memory e.g. in production settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[guard page] ... [reload shadow-stack top after return]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Combining these two thoughts led me to: wouldn't it be nice to just build this on the regular stack, where these problems are already solved ... which I think could actually be possible (let's call this "Option 2.5"): push refs on the real stack at any safepoint, in a contiguous block; push the block size; link this chunk into a list of chunks by reading <code>vmctx.ref_chain_head</code>, pushing that, and setting <code>vmctx.ref_chain_head</code> to this chunk. In other words, give up the contiguous-slice-of-live-pointers for linked-list-of-contiguous-chunks, but essentially <code>alloca()</code> those chunks.</p>
<p>I'm indifferent on Option 2.0 vs. Option 2.5 (adds complexity in one place, removes it from another); just thought I would add this to the mix.</p>

<p>That's actually a good point that having a switch to turn off dwarf unwinding info would be quite nice!</p>
<p>Anyway back to this isssue, I like the idea of using an alloca-equivalent rather than having to manage two stacks, it should help make the prologue a bit cheaper ideally and is one less stack to manage.</p>
