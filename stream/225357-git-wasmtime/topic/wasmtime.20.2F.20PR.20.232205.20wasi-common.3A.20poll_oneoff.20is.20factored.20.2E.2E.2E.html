<p>pchickey opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2205">PR #2205</a> from <code>pch/wasi_common_sched_methods</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>based on #2201 and #2202 </p>
<p>prior to this, we would report a missing entry for an fd as an error<br>
event, but not a bad capability. why? i think because of the way the<br>
code was written.</p>
<p>Also, we'd poll rather than report subscription errors as early as<br>
possible. This is an odd choice because maybe none of the non-errored<br>
subscriptions would ever come due, leaving the user waiting forever<br>
with no error to react to. So, now poll_oneoff returns early if<br>
any of the subscriptions were parsed as an error.</p>
<p>The extraction of the <code>Event</code> type and its subordinates from sched<br>
and sys is still incomplete. That representation changes in ephemeral<br>
and working on this refactoring has made me want to make even more<br>
changes to the design of the interface (userdata isnt a good design<br>
imho!) so i'm going to hold off on that for a minute till we come<br>
up with a better consensus on the design there.</p>
