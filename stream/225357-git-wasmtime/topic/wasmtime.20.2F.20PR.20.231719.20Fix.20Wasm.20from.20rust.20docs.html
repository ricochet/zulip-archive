<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I was playing around with this and noticed the docs are a bit broken. Here are my changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update wasmtime version in docs to 0.16.0<ul>
<li>Breaking API changes from #1524 were made in the docs, but the old version was kept</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change second code <code>wat</code> example.<ul>
<li>The run function does not return anything (I guess another option would be to return some value to keep the function call the same signature as previous but I think this may help some)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expose the whole file code for the updated usage on the second example<ul>
<li>Expanding from the previous example, it is confusing how the code is setup for this, as there is the other changes needed for this to run successfully</li>
<li>Open to suggestions or reverting this, as this is more opinionated</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
