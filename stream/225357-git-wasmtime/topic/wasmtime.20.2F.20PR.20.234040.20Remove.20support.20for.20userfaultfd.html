<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4040">PR #4040</a> from <code>rm-uffd</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit removes support for the <code>userfaultfd</code> or "uffd" syscall on<br>
Linux. This support was originally added for users migrating from Lucet<br>
to Wasmtime, but the recent developments of kernel-supported<br>
copy-on-write support for memory initialization wound up being more<br>
appropriate for these use cases than usefaultfd. The main reason for<br>
moving to copy-on-write initialization are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>userfaultfd</code> feature was never necessarily intended for this<br>
  style of use case with wasm and was susceptible to subtle and rare<br>
  bugs that were extremely difficult to track down. We were never 100%<br>
  certain that there were kernel bugs related to userfaultfd but the<br>
  suspicion never went away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling faults with userfaultfd was always slow and single-threaded.<br>
  Only one thread could handle faults and traveling to user-space to<br>
  handle faults is inherently slower than handling them all in the<br>
  kernel. The single-threaded aspect in particular presented a<br>
  significant scaling bottleneck for embeddings that want to run many<br>
  wasm instances in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the major benefits of userfaultfd was lazy initialization of<br>
  wasm linear memory which is also achieved with the copy-on-write<br>
  initialization support we have right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the suspected benefits of userfaultfd was less frobbing of the<br>
  kernel vma structures when wasm modules are instantiated. Currently<br>
  the copy-on-write support has a mitigation where we attempt to reuse<br>
  the memory images where possible to avoid changing vma structures.<br>
  When comparing this to userfaultfd's performance it was found that<br>
  kernel modifications of vmas aren't a worrisome bottleneck so<br>
  copy-on-write is suitable for this as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall there are no remaining benefits that userfaultfd gives that<br>
copy-on-write doesn't, and copy-on-write solves a major downsides of<br>
userfaultfd, the scaling issue with a single faulting thread.<br>
Additionally copy-on-write support seems much more robust in terms of<br>
kernel implementation since it's only using standard memory-management<br>
syscalls which are heavily exercised. Finally copy-on-write support<br>
provides a new bonus where read-only memory in WebAssembly can be mapped<br>
directly to the same kernel cache page, even amongst many wasm instances<br>
of the same module, which was never possible with userfaultfd.</p>
<p>In light of all this it's expected that all users of userfaultfd should<br>
migrate to the copy-on-write initialization of Wasmtime (which is<br>
enabled by default).</p>
