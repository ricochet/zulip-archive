<blockquote>
<p>Thanks all for the first batch of reviews!</p>
<p>@cfallin this makes sense to me. At this point there's not much that needs those relocations, if I'm not mistaken; mostly things that weren't trivially <code>Hash</code>ables, or source locations that were absolute, or external names being embedded and copied around. I'm looking into this.</p>

<li>there's a proliferation of <code>Name</code> types that could potentially be unified, maybe?</li>
<li><code>ExternalName</code> could just become a reference into the <code>FunctionParameters</code> mapping of reference to actual name value, as (it's likely, not proven that) codegen doesn't care about the identity of the function callee. So <code>ExternalName</code> would become a new entity type, and there'd be <code>ExternalNameData</code> in the table.

<li>optimization work could be done to identify why a recompilation is, in the worst case, only 50% faster than compiling from scratch (it should be much higher in theory).</li>

<p>@cfallin This new version incorporates changes to address your review feedback during the live review session (that we organized to help going through the changes, as this is a large patch). This is now ready and passes <code>cargo test --all</code> on my machine, with no performance regression on compile times, so I would claim this is ready :-) Cheers!</p>

<p>Hmm, @bnjbvr it looks like some of the changes broke the fuzz targets -- happy to merge once that is fixed up.</p>
