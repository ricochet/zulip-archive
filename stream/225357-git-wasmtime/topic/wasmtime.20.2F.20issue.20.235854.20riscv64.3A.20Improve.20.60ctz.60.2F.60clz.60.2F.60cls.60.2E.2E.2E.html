<blockquote>
<p>I've tried to review this a couple of times and have not succeeded yet. I think it would help me if you can split this into smaller PRs. It looks like you already structured individual commits carefully, but I think the main thing I want in this case is to keep separate the movement of definitions from the actual changes in lowering.</p>
<p>I'm open to alternative suggestions, but would you mind opening a new PR that moves existing definitions without changing them first? I'm hoping that makes the overall diff for _this_ PR easier to review as it should only have the actual logic changes.</p>
<p>If that's too much trouble, I'm happy to discuss other ways to split this, or I can try to review it as-is, or we can see if @elliottt or @cfallin is up for reviewing it. My trouble is that since I'm not familiar with risc-v I have to figure that out at the same time as following the motion of existing code and finding the real changes, and together that's apparently a bit too much for my brain.</p>

<p>No worries, and thanks for looking into it (and all the other PR's)!  <span aria-label="heart" class="emoji emoji-2764" role="img" title="heart">:heart:</span>️</p>
<p>I'll split this into general RISC-V rules cleanups and move the codegen changes into separate PR's.</p>
<hr>
<p>On that note, I've been thinking about doing a pass on the entire RISCV ruleset to add helpers for generating instructions. </p>
<p>We have a lot of:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">alu_rr_imm12</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">AluOPRRI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Andi</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">val</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">imm12_const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">255</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Which I would really like for it to become something along these lines:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rv_andi</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">val</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">imm12</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">255</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I think this would improve readability somwhat, the rules on RISCV are really verbose and I think this is part of it. What do you guys think about that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've heard other people say they consider that kind of helper really important in the x86 rules, so I imagine it's a good idea for all backends. I haven't authored enough backend rules to have an opinion myself though. My first reaction had originally been that it seemed like a lot of work with an unclear benefit, but I'm coming around to the conclusion that it's worth doing after all.</p>

<p>Rebased this on top of #5984, I've also separated the commits a bit, so it should be easier to review commit-by-commit.</p>
