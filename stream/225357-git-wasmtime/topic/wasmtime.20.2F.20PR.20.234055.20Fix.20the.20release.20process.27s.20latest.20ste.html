<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4055">PR #4055</a> from <code>fix-release</code> to <code>main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The automated release of 0.36.0 was attempted last night but it failed<br>
due to a [failure on CI][bad]. This failure comes about because it was<br>
trying to change the release date of 0.35.0 which ended up not modifying<br>
any fails so <code>git</code> failed to commit as no files were changed.</p>
<p>The original bug though was that 0.35.0 was being changed instead of<br>
0.36.0. The reason for this is that the script used<br>
<code>--sort=-committerdate</code> to determine the latest branch. I forgot,<br>
though, that with backports it's possible for 0.35.0 to have a more<br>
recent commit date than 0.36.0 (as is currently the case). This commit<br>
updates the script to perform a numerical sort outside of git to get the<br>
latest release branch.</p>
<p>Additionally this adds in some <code>set -ex</code> commands for the shell which<br>
should help print out commands as they're run and assist in future<br>
debugging.</p>
