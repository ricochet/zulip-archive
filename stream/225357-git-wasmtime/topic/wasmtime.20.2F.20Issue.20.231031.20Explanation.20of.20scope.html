<blockquote>
<p>Cranelift (formerly Cretonne) is currently focusing on "backend" compilation, however if it is successful, we hope to extend it some day with high-level inter-procedural optimizations.</p>
<p>While Cranelift includes the <code>cranelift-wasm</code> crate for translating wasm, it isn't sufficient for complete wasm compilation. One needs additional support, such as the support now provided by <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/">Wasmtime</a>.</p>
<p>It is theoretically possible that Cranelift could output to wasm some day, however it is not set up to do so right now.</p>
<p>Cranelift is indeed meant to be useful in both JIT and AOT configurations. <a href="https://github.com/fastly/lucet/" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/fastly/lucet/">Lucet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">rustc_codegen_cranelift</a> are examples of using it in an AOT configuration, and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/">Wasmtime</a> is an example of using it in a JIT configuration.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions, please re-open this issue or file a new one!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The readme says that cretonne is supposed to be a code generator for WebAssembly, but it's a bit unclear what that means, seeing how there doesn't appear to be anything to actually do with wasm in the code.</p>
<ul>
<li>I heard that cretonne is meant to have inter-procedural optimizations as another layer built over top. Is this true, and always going to be the case?</li>
<li>Does another tool to translate wasm to cretonne IR need to be built in order to generate code for wasm?</li>
<li>Is it in scope for cretonne to output <em>to</em> wasm, or is it only intended to output to native code? (e.g. will I be able to use cretonne as a pure-rust binaryen alternative?)</li>
<li>Is cretonne meant to be useful in both JIT and AOT configurations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Preferably, the readme or documentation should be able to answer these questions.</p>
