<p>slightlyoutofphase opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1676" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1676">PR #1676</a> from <code>master</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey! Author of StaticVec here. Been on a bit of a break from my usual commit spree for the crate, and was pretty surprised / pleased / etc. to come back and find it being used in a crate as big as this!</p>
<p>This PR does nothing other than update your dependency from version 0.8 to version 0.9, which I've personally tested and can confirm works fine (as it should, because TBH I actively avoid real "breaking changes" and really only ever add new things to StaticVec or improve the performance of existing things, as opposed to removing them / changing their public interfaces in incompatible ways / etc).</p>
<p>At most I might change how something is implemented under the hood, but never really in a way that alters what it ultimately does in practice.</p>
