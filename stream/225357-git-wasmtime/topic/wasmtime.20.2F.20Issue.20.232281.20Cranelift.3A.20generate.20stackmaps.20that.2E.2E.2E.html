<blockquote>
<p>Currently, Cranelift (with the new backend) generates stackmaps (meaning, maps that show the ref-typeness or otherwise of each word of stack).  There is one stackmap per function.  The stackmaps cover the function's frame.  Assuming a grow-down stack, the stack map covers the address range whose upper end is the pushed return address (or thereabouts), and extends downwards to cover all of the compiler-created temporaries, down to and including the outgoing parameter area for each call (for calls that pass args in memory).</p>
<p>This is unfortunately incompatible with SpiderMonkey's stackmap conventions, and complicates interworking with SpiderMonkey-compiled code.  In the SM convention, each function's incoming parameter area is covered by its own stackmap (not the caller's), and the outgoing parameter area(s) are <em>not</em> covered by its own stackmap -- those are covered by the callee's.  For one thing, this makes it easier to implement tail calls in the presence of stackmaps.</p>
<p>Hence this bug is a placeholder, for work on changing CL to use SpiderMonkey's conventions.</p>
