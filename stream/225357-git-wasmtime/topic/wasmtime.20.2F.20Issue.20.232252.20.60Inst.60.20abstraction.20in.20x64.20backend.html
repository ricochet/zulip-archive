<p>Yeah, I think a refactoring there is overdue. In my opinion, the way forward would be to have different Inst each time we need to, that is when:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Inst format (condition codes, etc.) doesn't match any available in the Inst list</li>
<li>the given Inst is specialized for a list of given register classes inputs and outputs</li>
<li>or the given Inst has "meta" semantics (nominal SP adjustment, soon the uninitialized Xmm)</li>
</ul>
<p>If an Vcode Inst doesn't have meta semantics, and there's another inst with the same format and input/output register classes, then a new Inst is not required.</p>
<p>Re: naming. I followed the initial choices from @julian-seward1 to have the Inst be named after their operands format, but we should rethink about this, and follow aarch64's example here of naming the instructions after what they do, not how they're defined at a low-level.</p>
<p>Re: the possibility of creating impossible inst: the <code>SseOpcode</code> enum is useful but too wide; instead we should have a subset of <code>SseOpcode</code>s for each Inst ctor, so that it becomes a compile error instead of a dynamic panic (or worse, a silent runtime error) to use the wrong opcode for a given inst. We can either have different enums that convert down to <code>SseOpcode</code>, or just one enum per <code>Inst</code> that's handled down to the bottom. I think the latter is preferable, since having enums that convert to <code>SseOpcode</code> would still make it possible to miss cases when emitting the machine instructions.</p>
<p>Re: ergonomics. We should go down the road of higher level assembly instructions, like it's been done for Inst::load/store etc, and use this pattern more. Maybe not all the time, but it's immensely useful to do so when the instruction is being constructed many times in many places, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I think we still could potentially clean up / orthogonalize things -- we haven't directly addressed this yet, AFAIK.</p>
