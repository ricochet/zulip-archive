<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Currently, the wasmtime top-level crate has a <code>build.rs</code> to generate a bunch of <code>#[test]</code>-annotated functions in <code>$OUT_DIR</code>. At build-time it finds all the "wast" tests in <code>tests/misc_testuite</code> and <code>tests/spec_testsuite</code> (if the latter submodule is present), and generates a couple test functions for each.</p>
<p>Instead I think we should set <code>harness = false</code> in <code>Cargo.toml</code> for <code>tests/all/wast.rs</code>, and give it a <code>main</code> function. It should find these tests when the test runs, not when it's compiled.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>I noticed this because adding a new test in <code>tests/misc_testsuite</code> didn't cause <code>$OUT_DIR/wast_testsuite_tests.rs</code> to get regenerated. Avoiding the build step means we don't have to make cargo re-run the build step when tests are added or changed.</p>
<p>Locating the wast files during runtime also means that if somebody didn't have <code>tests/spec_testsuite</code> cloned before trying to run the tests, they just have to run the appropriate <code>git submodule update</code> command and then try running tests again.</p>
<p>This should improve build time, both because we don't have to compile and run a <code>build.rs</code> plus <code>rustfmt</code>, and also because we don't have to compile a 140kB Rust source file when running tests.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>We have a similar situation in <code>cranelift/tests/filetests.rs</code>, which switched away from the libtest harness in 54f9587569f80c5899d1e75482197d87d2406e15.</p>
<p>With the current libtest-based implementation, we can run a specific wast test by passing its name to <code>cargo test</code>. It'd be nice to keep that feature. So the new <code>main</code> function would need to interpret <code>std::env::args</code> as passed to it by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html">cargo test</a>, and ideally match <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html#filters">how libtest interprets filters</a>. Maybe some of the other libtest command-line options would be nice to have too.</p>
<p>The parts of <code>build.rs</code> that find all the tests should get moved into <code>tests/all/wast.rs</code>. (I think it's especially helpful to preserve the warning that's reported if <code>tests/spec_testsuite</code> is empty.) Otherwise a significant part of the code is just arranging to emit calls to <code>run_wast</code>, which the non-libtest version can just call directly.</p>
<p>Under libtest, tests are run in parallel by default, but there's some effort in <code>tests/all/wast.rs</code> to somewhat limit parallelism. I think a purely sequential test-runner would probably do okay here, especially for a first cut. We could use rayon to add parallelism later if we want.</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>We could keep the current implementation. For use in CI, the current approach is okay and helps us catch bugs. I think it's mostly a footgun for developers who might try to add tests. But, uh, that's kind of important too.</p>
<p>We could also stop trying to use the cargo/rustc test infrastructure entirely, and either use shell scripts or a dedicated Rust program along the lines of clif-util. But it's nice to have all tests run in the same framework.</p>

<p>The downside of this is that it would mean giving up on a lot of features libtest offers out of the box like the way it prints test results, showing failed test crash backtraces and stdout/stderr (relevant libstd api's are unstable), test filtering, ...</p>
