<blockquote>
<p>One suggestion I might have though is that instead of changing the literal identifier used in Rust code to one with a version appended I think this would be a good use for <code>#[export_name = "foo"]</code> or <code>#[link_name = "foo"]</code> (depending on context). That way the symbol in Rust wouldn't change, but only the symbol at the binary level (which is what we care about the most here)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a really great suggestion, thank you! I did not know this was possible, but it simplifies things considerably.</p>

<p>Thanks for all of your help reviewing! I attempted handling s390x in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6673/commits/ff81d020954aa1347f6189d18ca478c9789b8bf6">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6673/commits/ff81d020954aa1347f6189d18ca478c9789b8bf6</a>. I tried to pass the suffix with the <code>-DSYMBOL_APPEND=10_0_0</code> approach as you suggested but found that it didn't process it for <code>.S</code> files so I went with a manual preprocess reading the file, doing a string replace, and outputting to a new file in <code>OUT_DIR</code>. I'm definitely open to feedback if there is a better approach, maybe there's a way to define the assembly from a <code>.c</code> file to get the compiler to do the preprocessing? And I assume somewhere in CI it will test with s390x?</p>

<p>I sent <a href="https://github.com/adampetro/wasmtime/pull/1">https://github.com/adampetro/wasmtime/pull/1</a> to avoid the need to copy files around, IIRC I dealt with voodoo like that a long time ago, but I'm not sure that's the simplest it can be.</p>
<p>This reminded me though that there's one more location at <code>crates/runtime/src/helpers.c</code> which will need to be versioned as well, and I think it's the same as the <code>*.S</code> files in theory? Other than that though I think this is good to go! And yeah s390x will be tested on a full CI on merge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drive-by clarifying thought that I just worked out: I was contemplating the non-composability of POSIX signals (as one does...) and wondering how multiple runtimes in one process would fare if each is trying to handle traps from its own respective instances. It turns out that Wasmtime <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/94095723e539096b6ff4120c4523982750abe4cc/crates/runtime/src/traphandlers/unix.rs#L11-L14">chains to previous signal handlers</a> if it wasn't active (TLS slot was null).</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> this mostly works, except I haven't been able to convince myself yet that it's safe if a Wasm instance in wasmtime-1 calls to host code which then calls a Wasm instance in wasmtime-2 which traps. Then both TLS slots are active; if wasmtime-1 catches the signal (registered its handlers last), will it properly chain to wasmtime-2? If so, we should probably document somewhere how this interaction is expected to work.</p>

<p>Good questions! Ones I had forgotten to consider with this...</p>
<p>I think though we should be good in theory. If you've got wasmtime-1 and wasmtime-2 both on the stack then if one faults and the others' handler ends up running first the handler should end up determining that the signal should not be caught and defer to the next handler. This is more-or-less falling out of the "we don't catch signals not caused by wasm" and the signals from wasmtime-1 appear like non-wasm signals to wasmtime-2 because the faulting address won't be in any known region.</p>
<p>I do agree though it'd be good to document this! It'd be better yet to even test it, although that part is sort of hard. As for where to document this I'm not entirely sure other than perhaps in the code along the lines of "this should be written to work when multiple wasmtimes are in the same process"</p>

<p>In theory we <em>could</em> have a test (maybe an integration test to avoid overhead in the usual <code>cargo test</code> case) that depends on some arbitrary previous version of wasmtime, as well as the current in-repo one. </p>
<p>Or: if we wrapped some globals into a context struct (at least the signal handlers and the allocated tls-slot) we could do something like</p>

<p>and <code>Engine::new()</code> uses some default <code>ProcessContext</code> that's a lazy-static global or somesuch. I'm not sure how difficult it would be to plumb the context to all the places it's needed though -- e.g. the signal handlers themselves need some root to start from (another TLS slot that is global?).</p>

<p>In theory we _could_ have a test (maybe an integration test to avoid overhead in the usual <code>cargo test</code> case) that depends on some arbitrary previous version of wasmtime, as well as the current in-repo one.</p>

<p>I tried out this approach in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6673/commits/6312b7062660d45372b4724b31ede2c518a6471b">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6673/commits/6312b7062660d45372b4724b31ede2c518a6471b</a> and it is relatively simple and passes. Is that what you had in mind? If not, I can revert that commit. I understand if you would rather not bring in an arbitrary previous version of <code>wasmtime</code>.</p>
<p>Apologies for the force push, I had to rebase due to another merge conflict with <code>main</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally think that adding a previous copy as a dependency is going to become pretty difficult to maintain over time and isn't worth the benefit yet. One of the issues with this is that if we ever update a dependency then we'll get <code>cargo deny</code> errors about duplicate dependencies since the old version of wasmtime will still have the old dependency -- this can sort of already be seen with <code>cargo deny</code> failing in CI on this PR. This is probably fixable, but I feel like that would be somewhat the tip of the iceberg in this case.</p>
<p>Additionally Chris's suggestion would be a good way to go but I dont think we can do that because it'd use the same copy of <code>wasmtime-runtime</code>-the-compiled-rlib which means that everything is using one TLS slot. While this shouldn't cause issues in theory it does mean that it's not a "perfect" emulation of multiple versions and may accidentally miss something crucial.</p>
<p>FWIW we have had integration issues along the lines of signal handlers in the past, for example with breakpoint on macOS and not wanting to use mach exception ports but instead use unix signals. Now that I type this out I think a multi-version wasmtime on macOS may not work because there's two threads handling exceptions and it's a race as to which gets a message and there's no delegate-to-the-next handler ability like there is with signals (or at least not implemented I think,  I'm not expert on mach)</p>
<p>So it may perhaps be best to instead fix issues on an issue-by-issue basis instead of declaring "wasmtime multi-version works great". My guess is there's weird platform intricacies here and whatever we test we'll never suss them all out. In that sense @adampetro's embedding might be the best test case for this feature as opposed to testing it in the repository itself?</p>

<p>FWIW, at least originally our plan is to use multi-version for compilation, while still executing with a single version. This will enable us to have a full cache of compiled modules when cutting over to a new version for execution.</p>

<p>Oh interesting! Oddly enough none of this is necessary technically if all you're doing is compiling modules since these are all "runtime bits" as opposed to compiler bits. That being said while Wasmtime has a compiler-less build mode it doesn't have a runtime-less build mode so there's no way to build wasmtime without the runtime bits right now.</p>
<p>To assuage @cfallin's concerns then one possiblity might be to have a runtime assertion that only one wasm runtime is loaded in to the process. I'm not sure if that's possible to do, though. I think that would work for your embedding @adampetro though?</p>
<p>Otherwise though for <code>cargo vet</code> I think you'll need to run <code>cargo vet</code> locally which should make some changes to <code>supply-chain/imports.lock</code> (I think) which can be committed here.</p>

<p>@bholley you might be interested in some of the above, but I think this boils down to we're adding a new crate to this repository and I think it may not be playing well with <code>audit-as-crates-io</code> since that seems like it may require the crate to exist on <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a>? (I may be missing something as well of course). I think it worked for all our other crates since they were already published, but as a new crate this may be running into something new.</p>

<p>Hm ok sorry for the runaround here! I think in this situation let's set <code>audit-as-crates-io</code> to <code>false</code> and we can fix it up later as necessary.</p>

<p>No worries, sounds good and thanks for the help!</p>

<p>@bholley you might be interested in some of the above, but I think this boils down to we're adding a new crate to this repository and I think it may not be playing well with <code>audit-as-crates-io</code> since that seems like it may require the crate to exist on <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a>? (I may be missing something as well of course). I think it worked for all our other crates since they were already published, but as a new crate this may be running into something new.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it is required that all crates marked as <code>audit-as-crates-io = true</code> be published on <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a>. We only support audits for published crates and published crate versions (if you have a newer version in tree, we require an audit for the most recently published version), so if there's no version of the crate on <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a>, you cannot have the crate marked as <code>audit-as-crates-io = true</code>, as there is no version which it is possible to have an audit for. </p>
<p>Once there is a published version of the crate you can switch to <code>audit-as-crates-io = true</code> to check that you're publishing audits for that version.</p>

<p>@alexcrichton If this crate isn't published, it shouldn't need an <code>audit-as-crates-io</code> entry at all. That field is specifically for crates which appear first-party but whose name and metadata match a published crate.</p>
