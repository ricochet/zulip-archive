<li>The current approach, adding label ghost-instructions and doing a post-hoc analysis, is general but potentially involves slow analysis.

<blockquote>
<p>This particular workload is compiling simple-raytracer with all of of its dependencies.</p>
<p>I would prefer not allocting a stackslot for every value for three reasons: I don't think it is acceptible to regress the already poor debugmode performance of rust even more. I don't want the choice to generate debuginfo or jot to influence the generated code. Gcc also doesn't let it influence the generated code. This has the advantage that enabling debuginfo doesn't change the behaviour of a program in case of UB or miscompilations, thus making them easier to debug. Finally value debuginfo may be useful for on stack replacement in case of a tiered JIT. Regressing performance in this case is unacceptable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, perhaps not, though I'd be interested to measure how large the regression would be.</p>
<p>The "right" answer here, I think, is to rely on <a href="http://regalloc.rs">regalloc.rs</a> to provide us location info per vreg per program-point. Unfortunately without that we're forced to do an analysis of some sort to recover the info.</p>
<p>It's possible the analysis data structures could be improved: I notice that a lot of time is spent in cloning <code>HashMap</code>s for example; perhaps a delta-based scheme with some structure sharing could be designed. If someone has the time to experiment with this (I unfortunately don't at the moment, first priority is completeness for the switchover) I'd be happy to discuss or review...</p>

<p>FWIW, GCC does (or at least used to) go with the second approach suggested above of giving everything a fixed stack slot.</p>
