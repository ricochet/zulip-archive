<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>For functions that may pass sensitive information (think secrets), we should have the ability to suppress tracing of those functions.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>I have an implementation (which I'll open a PR with) which replaces the newly-added <code>tracing</code> boolean flag to the <code>from_witx!</code> macro with one called <code>suppress_tracing</code> which has a format equivalent to the existing <code>async</code> flag.  In other words, you can match everything by setting it to <code>*</code> (the equivalent to <code>tracing: false</code> now), or you can specify a list of identifiers in braces to disable logging for certain functions.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">wiggle</span>::<span class="n">from_witx</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">suppress_tracing</span>: <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">witx</span>: <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"..."</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">});</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">wiggle</span>::<span class="n">from_witx</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">suppress_tracing</span>: <span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="n">module1</span>::<span class="n">func</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="n">module2</span>::<span class="n">another_func</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">witx</span>: <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"..."</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">});</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can reuse the existing <code>AsyncConfField</code> and <code>AsyncFunctions</code> types for this, so I have renamed them to be more general in my implementation.</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>I had originally implemented this alongside the existing <code>tracing</code> flag, and we could continue to have that one if it's important for usability or backward compatibility.  But as I was implementing it it seems odd to have both since there was a lot of overlap, and the <code>async</code> implementation fit it nicely.</p>
<p>It's a bit negatory -- "suppress_tracing" -- which I don't love in an API but I think is necessary because you'll generally want to select specific sensitive functions that you don't want to trace.  In the implementation I flip the meaning so there isn't negation-of-negation.<br>
