<blockquote>
<p>Please try to describe precisely what you would like to do in Cranelift and/or<br>
expect from it. You can answer the questions below if they're relevant and<br>
delete this text before submitting. Thanks for opening an issue!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is the feature or code improvement you would like to do in Cranelift?<br>
After merging <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1169">bytecodealliance/cranelift#1169</a> (and seeing <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1168">bytecodealliance/cranelift#1168</a>), it occurred to me that we should output clippy warnings as a part of <code>test-all.sh</code>. I'm not sure we should fail the build (though this could be an option) but this would make non-clippy-approved additions more visible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the value of adding this in Cranelift?<br>
It should result in cleaner, more standard code in the long run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>
  algorithms to use?<br>
Add <code>cargo clippy</code> to <code>test-all.sh</code> and ensure <code>clippy</code> is installed for Azure pipelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they better<br>
  or worse than your proposal?<br>
No.<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Clippy is currently checked on CI although most lints are turned off. It's intended that we'll enable clippy lints on a case-by-case basis and watch them in CI.</p>
