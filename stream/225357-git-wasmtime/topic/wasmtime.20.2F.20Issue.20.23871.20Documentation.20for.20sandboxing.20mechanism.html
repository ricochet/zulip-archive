<p>Hello! I recently started adding some content to the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/security-sandboxing.html#webassembly-core" target="_blank" title="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/security-sandboxing.html#webassembly-core">security-sandboxing</a> document, and it answers this question, at least at a high level.</p>
<p>All "pointers" in C are compiled into wasm as indices into linear memory, which you can think of as just an array of bytes, with bounds checking. So while your vulnerable C code may store beyond the ends of the nominal array, it can't access any memory outside the wasm instance's memory.</p>
<p>Also, all control transfers in wasm are checked, at compile time or runtime, to ensure they go to known branch/jump destinations. Among other things, this means that even if you load a machine-code payload, you can't make the program jump to it.</p>
<p>Does this clarify things? If not, please let us know as we're interested in expanding the documentation to answer questions people have!</p>

<p>better late than never :)</p>
<p>Yes, that document clarifies things a lot. Many thanks!<br>

<p>I noticed the documentation for how the sandbox works is just a stub currently. I would really like to know more about it, so this issue is just to track progress.</p>
<ul>
<li>I read <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance">https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance</a> and am enthousiastic</li>
<li>I played around with rust / wasmpack before and tried the hello world and capabilities system in wasmtime.</li>
<li>I understand how proper wasm modules only get access to certain resources and capabilities their parent gives them</li>
<li>However, compiled(jitted) code all runs in 1 (operating system) process so it can <em>potentially</em> do system calls and access all memory in the process</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing I would really like to get clarified is how the sandbox (and possibly the just-in-time compilation of wasm to machine code) will protect against the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>I create a bit of c code that has a buffer overflow in a function</li>
<li>I compile this c code to wasm</li>
<li>I say my wasm module doesn't need any capabilities and only expose a string -&gt; string function</li>
<li>I create an additional module that will call the vulnerable module with a payload that overflows the buffer with some machine code for the target architecture</li>
<li>this machine code isn't generated by the jit, didn't come from a valid wasm module</li>
<li>so it can do things like memory access and syscalls and isn't bound to what the wasm module received as inputs</li>
<li>I somehow find a way to have the instruction pointer jump to this malicious code (as I would be able to do in c)</li>
</ul>
<p>My guess is that either the overflowing wouldn't work (how is this protected given that c is compilable into wasm), or there is no way to get the overflowed malicious code to execute (how would wasmtime protect against this?), but I would like some nice documentation explaining this.</p>
