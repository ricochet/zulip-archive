<blockquote>
<p>Currently Cranelift will emit a stack map for a trap instruction. This is frequently done with <code>.take_stack_map()</code>, however, and some "compound opcodes", such as float-to-int conversion on x64, have many traps throughout their body. Only one trap will get the stack map when they theoretically all need the stack map.</p>
<p>Additionally, though, Wasmtime doesn't actually need stack maps at trap opcodes since after a trap an instance will be terminated and all stack-based roots will become unrooted and candidates for GC. </p>
<p>Given this I think it would be best to remove all stack maps from traps since they're otherwise just taking up space in the compiled artifact and aren't getting used for anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This seems correct to me (i.e., safe to remove); and furthermore, might result in decent codegen improvements in code using reftypes. This is because in addition to the stackmap metadata itself, the safepoint-at-every-trap implies spilling all ref values to the stack. So code that (i) has refs and (ii) has other ops that trap, like divides or non-truncating float/int conversions, might see speedups.</p>
