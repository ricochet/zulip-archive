<p>We introduce <code>bounds_checked_load</code> and <code>bounds_checked_store</code> instructions that match wasm semantics.

<p>Thanks for writing this up! I think you're right here, and I agree with your ordering. 3 seems like a good approach to me, though I would mildly prefer 1 as it's not adding additional instructions. As we discussed in a DM, adding a mechanism to mark instructions as expected to be legalized would address my concerns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@fitzgen and I just talked about this at some length and I also agree that rewriting from the "wasm load" semantic unit-of-work directly to lower-level instructions is a good approach.</p>
<p>We also talked about the handling of the index+offset computation (what is currently handled by <code>uadd_overflow_trap</code> in the legalization from <code>heap_addr</code>) and came the conclusion that it probably makes sense to stick with <code>uadd_overflow_trap</code>, rather than <code>iadd_cout</code> with the carry-out feeding into a select. This is for a few reasons: (i) we'd need to feed the condition into the final select (after the addition of the heap base), not an intermediate select, and this implies reifying the carry out of the add and greater-than-or-equal condition out of the bounds check as bools and or'ing them together, which is worse codegen then we have today; and (ii) we don't actually need a Spectre-guard-style select on the result of the add-overflow check, because an overflow of index+offset (that nevertheless stays within the sandbox bounds) will not see another heap, even speculatively; it'll just see part of the current heap.</p>
<p>So basically, (i) keep what we ultimately legalize into today, but (ii) do it without <code>heap_addr</code> in the middle, by either legalizing from <code>heap_load</code> or de-facto legalizing in <code>cranelift-wasm</code>. I sort of prefer the former as long as we have a concept of <code>heap</code> entities, and removing those and moving the complexity to <code>cranelift-wasm</code> seems like a lot of unnecessary work (and we get useful checking of its implementation by having it at the CLIF level, because of the interpreter's implementation of it).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After implementing (the easy) half of (3) and talking it over with @cfallin I am now leaning towards pivoting to (1), that is removing the concept of heaps from CLIF altogether and doing the legalization immediately inside <code>cranelift-wasm</code>.</p>
<p>The reasons are that (3) involves making heap versions of a bunch of instructions we already have in CLIF: the extending loads and stores like <code>uload8</code> et al, the SIMD versions of those like <code>uload8x8</code> et al, and various atomic instructions. <code>uload8</code> et al could be replaced with backend rules for matching <code>(uextend.i64 (load.i8 ...))</code> patterns but this is a bunch of churn for little gain and also requires answering questions like "how do we generalize <code>SinkableLoad</code> to all of our backends?". It is a little bit of a rabbit hole in its own right.</p>
<p>(1) would not require removing, replacing, or duplicating any CLIF instructions other than the <code>heap_*</code> instructions which are directly related to CLIF heaps. That's nice. Furthermore, we avoid having additional "temporary" CLIF instructions that exist only momentarily at the start of compilation before being legalized away, never to be seen by a backend. Also aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Will dig into this a bit and report back.</p>
