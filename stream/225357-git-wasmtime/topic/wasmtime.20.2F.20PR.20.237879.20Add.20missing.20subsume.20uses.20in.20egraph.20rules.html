<p>elliottt opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7879">PR #7879</a> from <code>elliottt:trevor/subsume-use</code> to <code>bytecodealliance:main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a quick pass over the egraph rules to look for cases that violate our new guidelines about when <code>subsume</code> is required. There were a few cases where <code>subsume</code> was needed, and though I believe those instances were benign I think they're worth adding to make sure we're following the spirit of our new guidelines.</p>
<p>I've also added some clarifying text about constants in the test of guideline 2, to make it more obvious that cases where we discard constants are okay without <code>subsume</code>.</p>
