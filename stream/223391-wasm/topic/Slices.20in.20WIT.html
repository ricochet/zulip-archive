<p>In my current WIP wasm component to manage a wayland compositor I've been thinking of integrating wgpu under the hood but I realize some things like <code>Buffer::map</code> will require a copy between the runtime and the host. I was wondering if there was any proposal to allow WIT to describe a host owned slice (or block of memory) that the runtime can write into?</p>
<p>I'd think something like a <code>slice&lt;u8&gt;</code>. In my use case with wgpu I'd probably make the buffer resource have a function like <code>func slice() -&gt; option&lt;slice&lt;u8&gt;&gt;</code> to get the slice.</p>
<p>However I do realize that there might be a use case for the runtime owning a slice vs always having it borrowed out like in Rust.</p>

<p>Actually it might be a footgun to have a function the runtime calls to get a slice from inside the host? In rust this would probably double borrow the state?</p>

<p>Wasm does appear to have untyped memory, but I imagine that exposing that raw memory is a huge footgun</p>

<p>As you've seen WIT doesn't currently have a <code>slice</code> type and there currently isn't a design/proposal to add one. If you're interested in this though opening an issue on the component-model repository with more information might be a good next step. It's unlikely this will be added in the near future though</p>

<p>Okay I will make an issue when I can.</p>
<p>I guess for now is there an unsafe way of sorts to have the host give the runtime raw memory via the component model?</p>

<p>Wasmtime has a WasmVec type for this  but that's the closest you'll get and it's not easy to use</p>

<p>Another option is to model the buffer as a <code>resource</code>, which lets you pass around handles. That avoids the copying, but the downside is that you can't directly load/store to the buffer from the API; all accesses must go through function calls.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that this would solve the issue of copies</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="wit"><pre><span></span><code>resource buffer {
    get: func(offset: u64) -&gt; u8

    set: func(offset: u64, write: u8)
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>If a buffer looked like this, you'd be limited to single reads and writes which would definitely result in a huge amount of context switches in and out of the wasm runtime</p>
