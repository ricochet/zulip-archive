<p>I still struggle (as someone learning Rust) with being able to add WASM support to general purpose Rust crates. I compiled rs-natural with wasm-pack but realized it was unusable because I couldn't access any of the functions from js. </p>
<p>Besides the tips in <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/book/reference/add-wasm-support-to-crate.html">this</a> article, is there anything else to look out for when trying to use a general crate to target wasm?</p>

<p>in the same way as if you were trying to use a random crate from C you would need to wrap the crate and provide a C API, you will need to do the same thing for providing Wasm exports that make the crate's functionality available to JS</p>
<p>typically, this involves writing a new crate that depends on your target crate and wasm-bindgen, and uses wasm-bindgen to define an interface for working with the underlying crate</p>
