<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I just saw this post on Hacker News: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38184339">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38184339</a></p>
<p>Without context, I imagine this would actually be pretty confusing to most readers — e.g. how "official" is this, who is working on it, how far along is it, is it actually likely to end up in core Wasm, etc.</p>
<p>If anyone here is more knowledgeable about the proposal, might it be worth adding some context in the comments?</p>
<p>I only suggest this because a lot of the time I see Wasm discussed on, e.g., Hacker News, there is a lot of confusion and accidental misinformation. I see an opportunity here to get ahead of that.</p>

<p>Hey Jeff, thank you for raising this here. I was about to write a clarifying comment, but I'm honestly not sure what to add that's not front-and-center on the website itself. WasmFX is one of two proposals under consideration in the stack-switching subgroup of the WebAssembly CG, and is being prototyped/implemented in wasmtime and the tools around it by the people driving the proposal itself</p>
