<p>Hello! Me and a colleague of mine would like to tackle issue #6260, proposing a better approach for instruction scheduling using heuristics.</p>
<p>First, it would be good to know if the proposal is still relevant, given almost a year has passed since it was first published. For example, is there current work that would invalidate this, or, are you aware of someone already trying to implement it?</p>
<p>We should note that while we feel like we adequately understand the heuristics proposed in the paper, we don't have any experience in the cranelift codebase. If you deem it necessary, we would be happy to join the weekly meeting (we also don't know how to do this).</p>

<p>Yes, it's still relevant! In my opinion at least, it'd be really useful to get at least approximate answers to: (i) how much benefit do we see with <em>any</em> sort of scheduling (versus the demand-driven / implicitly-sunk-to-latest approach we have now) across a wider set of benchmarks than the examples we've seen where it matters; and (ii) how low can we push the compile-time cost, to fit with the general ethos of Cranelift's optimizations</p>

<p>in the linked issue with the example that drove this thinking, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6159#issuecomment-1498177922">here</a> I gave a possibly acceptable and very simple approach: try to preserve original ordering when one can (and maybe extend the notion of ordering to "nodes created while rewriting another node"). That addresses the "llvm/user carefully scheduled the inner loop" cases, at least, without getting into complex heuristics</p>

<p>In Issue #6260 Jamey Sharp referenced a paper that combines two greedy techniques Critical Path (CP) that "counts the maximum length of any data-dependent chain of instructions that must execute after this instruction before the end of the block". Last Used Count  (LUC) that "It counts how many live-ranges will end if we place this instruction now. Put another way, for each operand, check whether there are any other instructions that will use the same value but haven't been scheduled yet". The LUC is used first, as a tie breaker we have the CP and as a last resort tie breaker we can use the smallest instruction number to be scheduled first. Other heuristics could be applied to but I think for a first approach we can try the CP+LUC first what do you think?</p>

<p>Hello again!</p>
<p>Since this has been our first interaction with cranelift, we took some time (me and Panagiotis) to understand the codebase and the egraph concept a bit. We have some questions on where the arbitrary topo-sort selection of instructions (as described in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6260">issue #6260</a>) appears inside code. We have pinpointed three places on <code>elaborate.rs</code> you might be talking about:</p>
<ol>
<li>In <code>elaborate_domtree()</code> (although this should not concern basic blocks):</li>

<p><em>Starting note: if this seems more like something that should be posted as an issue reply, please tell us.</em></p>
<p>We started a prototype implementation <a href="https://github.com/karouzakisp/wasmtime">here</a> for the program order retention approach.</p>
<h1>Implementation steps</h1>
<ul>
<li>For each pure <code>Inst</code> removed from the function's layout, we give it a monotonically increasing sequence number using an instance of your <code>SecondaryMap</code> structure.</li>
<li>During the elaboration stack processing, instead of eagerly elaborating instructions we do the following:<ul>
<li>If the instruction was already present in the function's layout before the egraph optimizations, we insert it in a priority queue based on its sequence number, along with its <code>before</code> instruction as found in <code>process_elab_stack()</code>.</li>
<li>If the instruction was generated during egraph optimization, we eagerly elaborate the entire priority queue (respecting the stored <code>before</code> placements) in ascending sequence order (presumably respecting the original order), and then elaborate the egraph-generated one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We elaborate all instructions in our queue  (respecting the stored <code>before</code> placements) each time we finish with a skeleton instruction.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Possible mistakes</h1>
<ul>
<li>We are not confident how the optimization(?) of hoisting instructions outside loops works, so our keeping of <code>before</code> placements might be erroneous.</li>
<li>We currently eagerly elaborate all instructions coming from rematerialization through <code>maybe_remat_arg()</code>.</li>
<li>We are not certain if our process of finding if an instruction was in the original function layout is correct. The <code>SecondaryMap</code> we use takes an <code>Inst</code> and gives us a sequence number, but does a <code>Layout</code> have duplicate <code>Inst</code> entries, or are all of them unique? </li>
</ul>
<h1>Other notes</h1>
<p>With our current implementation we don't reorder among neither egraph-generated instructions, nor skeleton instructions. The latter we believe is already optimal for the non-heuristics approach, but for the former we are thinking the delta approach might give us bigger reorder-ready ranges. We are not sure how frequent are such new instruction generations from the egraph though, so it might not be worth it in the end to track their generation roots.</p>
<p>We are aware that an <code>InstNode</code> in <code>Layout</code> has a <code>seq</code> field. I think we don't have access to this field currently, so we created a <code>u32</code> sequence number to simulate this that wraps around.</p>
<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>When running <code>cargo test</code> for the entire project (on x86_64 machines), we pass 161/1183 tests. We believe most failed tests are because they expect a fixed sequence of instructions, and we indeed see from the failure outputs that our implementation reorders some of them. There were some though that concearned us, since they duplicated some instructions. One such test is <code>disas</code> / <code>load-store</code> / <code>x64</code> / <code>load_store_static_kind_i32_index_0_guard_yes_spectre_i8_access_0x1000_offset.wat</code>.</p>
<p>We tried to simply run the benchmarks from issue <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6159">#6159</a> with our release build of wasmtime, and they indeed ran without any observable problems (noted that we are extremely inexperienced here). Even concequtive runs from the same build had measurable variance, hence when comparing to the build without our commit the results were not clear. That's probably because we did them with our laptops, but still, it might be worth it to verify the stability of the results from issue <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6159">#6159</a> .</p>
<p>We had to port the <code>run.sh</code> script from the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6159">#6159</a> to the current CLI format. Also noted that we couldn't find the option to disable egraph optimization on the new wasmtime CLI.</p>

<p>Thanks for the pointers! — we didn't have time to check the contributors' documentation extensively...</p>
<p>We also just found Chris Fallin's talk on egraphs in cranelift. We couldn't find the recording from the conference, so until now we relied on the accompanying slides, which was a bit less than ideal.</p>

<p>We're trying to tackle the heuristics-approach implementation since yesterday, but if you have any comments on the proposed implementation for the program-order-retention approach tell us.</p>
<p>If you exclude some comment-notes, the diff for our prototype program-order-retention implementation is quite small — should you want to look at the actual code.</p>

<p>One high-level note: it may be the case that you’ll need to run more benchmark iterations and/or tackle system noise; instantiation time should not change at all if you’re only changing codegen (it involves only data structure + memory setup performed by the runtime, not Cranelift-compiled code) so if it has deltas on the same order as your reported results that likely indicates noise</p>

<p>Register allocation can be impacted by any mid-end change including rematerialization, just because they perturb the input to the register allocator, but I don't think there's any specific dependency between them. I'm not sure I understood the question though?</p>

<p>+1 to all of Jamey's answers above re: independence of the two bits. Regalloc should be happy with any valid VCode, and we should get valid VCode from valid CLIF (ergo, one way to find this might be to explicitly run the CLIF validator at various points).</p>
<p>Re: the assert: <code>compile.rs:76</code> is just where regalloc is invoked; this is propagating upward an error that regalloc2 detected. Specifically <code>EntryLivein</code> means that some register was used that was never defined (it was a live-in at entry, which isn't supposed to happen). Likely this means that an instruction is missing somewhere. Running the CLIF validator as above should find this at an earlier point and indicate exactly where in the CLIF the problem is.</p>
<p>Re: this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We just aren't sure where to go next if the tests in cranelift-tools pass, and we seem to have proper IR output in them...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The test suite is fine but mostly has small functions, so especially for algorithmic tweaks that start to get interesting with more substantial block sizes (see: instruction scheduling!), I'd expect one to have to expand the test suite to fully cover its behavior. So it doesn't surprise me that it currently passes the suite but fails on a real program. The way I would go about this is resolving the bug as above -- add the validator, add as many debug prints as needed, extract the CLIF -- then when the bug is fixed, turn it into a regression test (new entry in the suite). In general I think we'd consider something like this feature well-tested when it passes (i) the suite, (ii) fuzzing, and (iii) reasonable real programs like spidermonkey.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, there's a Cranelift option to enable the verifier, right? I don't remember what the option is called. Also, this reminds me that a good step in between the small CLIF filetests and a large program like Spidermonkey might be the <code>disas</code> tests, which you can run with <code>cargo test --test disas</code>, if I remember correctly. They have a little bit more interesting control flow while still being pretty small.</p>

<p>It kinda seemed logical to me that our <code>disas</code> errors might be from checks using the previous ordering, so I gave them my blessing (with <code>WASMTIME_TEST_BLESS=1</code>), and the errors disappeared. We also put the following at the end of <code>egraph_pass()</code> (after our scheduling):</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">// self.verify_if(fisa)</span>

<span class="nb">Ok</span><span class="p">(())</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We then starting tackling <code>blake3-simd</code> from Sightglass (which we can see when compiling that it gives us a familiar error), but got stuck in trying to get it to emit egraph-optimized clif.</p>
<p>We want the  optimized clif to diff it with the previous implementation, but the --emit-clif option from wasmtime probably gives us unoptimized clif (edit: we think that because it emits the same functions using our implementation, and using the previous one).</p>
<p>Do you  know of a way to get optimized clif using the wasmtime binary (or another tool), or should we print it explicitly through changes in the code?</p>

<p>You're right that <code>--emit-clif</code> prints as soon as the first CLIF is generated, before any optimization passes. I haven't been very satisfied with the options we have for getting optimized CLIF from there. What I usually do is put the unoptimized CLIF in a file and add </p>

<p>We probably fixed all the errors. The error in Spidermonkey was due to the rank pairing heap implementation. After modifying it a bit we ran Spidermonkey with no problems. Tomorrow we will have benchmarks (without the remat and licm optimizations).</p>

<p>So... we are quite bad on compilation (up to 194% worse), but out of the three default benchmarks, two have no difference in execution time, and spidermonkey has 2–4% better performance in cycles.

<p>That is what we call a, uh, "growth opportunity" :-) Worth profiling and seeing if there are simple improvements that could give quick speedups, paying attention to allocations, etc.</p>
<p>FWIW, the alternative "keep sequence numbers from original code" idea I had proposed was made with exactly this worry, that a full recomputation of an instruction order would be too expensive; maybe it's worth trying that too</p>

<p>We kinda tried that, but we got up to the point of rearranging among new egraph-generated instructions, and not across them, with mixed results if I remember correctly.

<p>After a few optimizations following flamegraph sessions, we got compilation a bit closer (but it's still probably not good enough). Surprisingly, even though we didn't change anything that should affect execution performance, we are now worse (consistent with multiple runs, unlike last time). Keep in mind though that we still haven't re-applied LICM and rematerialization (currently working a bit on LICM). </p>

<p>So, compared to cycles, the motivation for using retired instructions for compilation performance would be to get more stable results, or is there something else you have in mind?</p>

<p>For the compilation overhead, we managed to reduce it from 200% to 44% in a couple of hours using vtune. I am optimistic that we can lower it even more.<br>

<p>That's a complicated question and I think different people would answer it different ways. Personally, I'm more concerned about whether the implementation is clear and easy to maintain; I feel it's okay to have some room for improvement in compile time if we're comfortable with our ability to work on it more later. Unfortunately I still haven't had a chance to carefully review your code.</p>
<p>One thing I'm curious about is whether the heuristics are separable. Hypothetically, could you add options that allow someone to enable or disable the critical path heuristic, or the last-use count heuristic, independently of each other? If so, does one have more impact than the other on either compile time or execution time?</p>
<p>There are downsides to adding options like this (more configurations to test and more confusion for users, for example) but one option I am considering is merging your changes under an off-by-default option. I would really like to have your work upstream! We just need to be confident that we can maintain it and also manage our other goals, such as compile speed.</p>

<p>I wanted to read a bit more documentation in sightglass before I asked the question that Panagiotis mentioned...</p>
<p>But since he did, the question would be on the significance of compilation vs execution time in the Sightglass benchmarks. I remember seeing compilation taking a lot more cycles in e.g. Spidermonkey. Is that conforming with real-world expectations, or would a slightly better execution time amortize an e.g. 30% worse compilation time?</p>

<p>The reason that's a complicated question is that it depends on how people are using Cranelift, and that varies a lot. I believe originally Cranelift was intended for use in JIT compilers, so compilation time was extremely important. It's still important, especially for uses like the Rust compiler's Cranelift backend as an alternative to LLVM, where the goal is to get debug builds quickly. But then for example at Fastly where we use Cranelift via Wasmtime, we'll compile a module once and invoke it many times, so compile time is less important there than execution time. When we maintainers make decisions about Cranelift, we're trying to keep all these different uses in mind.</p>

<p>Really cool to hear about this progress!</p>
<p>I think at a high level we should consider upstreaming this under a default-off option at least -- the bar for that is much lower. "Try this option if you want to optimize further", something like an <code>-O3</code> setting (whereas by analogy today's Cranelift is something like <code>-O2</code>).</p>
<p>I was about to say more but Jamey beat me to it re: compile-time :-) The only thing I'd add is that we've had a fairly high standard of "grind on the thing for weeks/months to squeeze out more performance" (at least, I've personally done this on RA2 and the original aegraphs impl) so going back the other way with say 30% regressions in compile time feels like a huge loss :-) Ideally we'd optimize to a local maximum as much as possible and see how low we can get it before turning it on by default. Again, can definitely happen in-tree as long as it doesn't affect the default build!</p>

<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="254389">@Chris Fallin</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="504918">@Jamey Sharp</span> </p>
<p>I am afraid I have bad news to share today.</p>
<p>Me and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="709820">@Dimitris Aspetakis</span>  are a bit disappointed because since we completed the implementation,<br>
we got no speedup almost on all the benchmarks except in some of the benchmarks in XNNPACK. We ran the benchmarks many times and we verified this.<br>
We verified also that the implementation works correctly by taking a complex function out of Spidermonkey and executing separately to see the new order of instructions.</p>
<p>Also we are a bit stuck on improving the compilation time with overhead 20-25%. Seems the priority queue has too much overhead that we cannot find a way to avoid, especially the delete/pop operation that we do on every (pure) Instruction that we insert into the layout. <br>
We don't want this work to go to waste so we would like to know if our implementation is close to some other heuristic we can try. Personally, I am thinking that instruction scheduling across blocks might be more beneficial, but can be more expensive also.</p>

<p>It's always disappointing when that happens! We've certainly had plenty of other Cranelift changes we were excited about that didn't turn out to be helpful so I feel your pain here. If you're not ready to give up though then I'm not either!</p>
<p>I'm not sure from your description which things you've already tried. Did you test a version with only the LUC heuristic and not the CP heuristic? You'd previously thought that perhaps you only needed a priority queue because of the CP heuristic. It would be great to keep the critical path heuristic to improve instruction-level parallelism. But of the two I actually expect bigger wins from the last-use count heuristic reducing register pressure, and therefore reducing the number of stack spills and reloads needed.</p>

<p>In addition to Jamey's thoughts I wanted to add a bit of meta-encouragement / a snapshot of my own philosophy on these things, if it helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First off, this exploration <em>is</em> extremely valuable, even if it turns out not to have the perf characteristics that would let us put it in by default. All of the work we're doing is basically research, a kind of "hill-climbing" trying to find ways to move toward better perf (or maintainability or correctness or ...). Finding out that in a certain direction the slope is actually downward gives us a lot of information -- it means others don't spend time on it later, or perhaps we've learned which specific parts were expensive, or are inspired to think about certain aspects of the problem more, etc.</p>
<p>So in that sense I almost think of the current state of the tree -- what's in, what's out, what's on by default, which approach we've taken -- as the sum of all approaches we've tried, and whichever one "wins" for our current metrics is incidental.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, conditions change over time; maybe we find new benchmarks where good scheduling matters more, or maybe we try something more exotic with our elab pass that requires active scheduling more urgently, or ... basically it's useful to know that we <em>can</em> do this if we need to and that it addressed the one case (xnnpack) where we saw the issue. That doesn't mean we merge it now necessarily but does mean it's useful to keep the branch and notes on its final state and conclusions around.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, to echo Jamey, please feel free to keep going if you want; but we've already gotten value from this so I hope you don't feel like it "failed" in any really substantial way!</p>

<p>The best case is that we have logical errors in our implementation <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span> — something that should surface after creating explicit testfiles checking for expected instruction scheduling.</p>
<p>Other than that, the only way I can think of that might get us closer to an ideal scheduling (using the current heuristics) is using weights for the critical path metric according to how "heavy" an opcode is...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition to Jamey's thoughts I wanted to add a bit of meta-encouragement / a snapshot of my own philosophy on these things, if it helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First off, this exploration <em>is</em> extremely valuable, even if it turns out not to have the perf characteristics that would let us put it in by default. All of the work we're doing is basically research, a kind of "hill-climbing" trying to find ways to move toward better perf (or maintainability or correctness or ...). Finding out that in a certain direction the slope is actually downward gives us a lot of information -- it means others don't spend time on it later, or perhaps we've learned which specific parts were expensive, or are inspired to think about certain aspects of the problem more, etc.</p>
<p>So in that sense I almost think of the current state of the tree -- what's in, what's out, what's on by default, which approach we've taken -- as the sum of all approaches we've tried, and whichever one "wins" for our current metrics is incidental.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, conditions change over time; maybe we find new benchmarks where good scheduling matters more, or maybe we try something more exotic with our elab pass that requires active scheduling more urgently, or ... basically it's useful to know that we <em>can</em> do this if we need to and that it addressed the one case (xnnpack) where we saw the issue. That doesn't mean we merge it now necessarily but does mean it's useful to keep the branch and notes on its final state and conclusions around.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, to echo Jamey, please feel free to keep going if you want; but we've already gotten value from this so I hope you don't feel like it "failed" in any really substantial way!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please find the time to think and propose ideas. Maybe we can try something in the near future. <br>
Personally I am thinking that the heuristics don't work well because the CPU can do optimal instruction scheduling almost in every single block except inside loops, this is why some of the benchmarks in XNNPACK are better with our heuristics. <br>
Maybe moving instructions from hot paths to other basic blocks may improve performance, this my basic idea, but I don't think we have enough information to identify a hot path</p>

<p>An out-of-order CPU should be able to do well with loops too, as long as it predicts the branches well enough. It will just keep looking forward and finding more instructions to run from future loop iterations until it runs out of buffer, which may be hundreds of instructions on a modern CPU.</p>
<p>I think CPUs are less good at dealing with registers getting spilled to the stack and reloaded later. They may be able to optimize away the load if the store is still in the store buffer, but they still have to execute the store, eventually writing all the way to main memory. So anything we can do that reduces register pressure ought to be good, I think.</p>
<p>We do loop-invariant code motion (LICM) already, which is the only form of "moving instructions from hot paths" that I can think of right now, but perhaps we could do it better somehow?</p>

<p>I watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx64V74Mba0&amp;">Unison</a> video from EuroLLVM2017 that combines Instruction Selection and Register Allocation into a single combinatorial problem. Obviously that is too slow but it showcases examples where LLVM does poor job and then you can implement something better based on this observation. If we had something like this on cranelift we could do the same. Perhaps we don't need it at all, if we can use Unison and compare it with the output of Cranelift to simple test programs to identify where cranelift does poor job. This could be a good plan in my opinion.</p>

<p>Not yet, but it certainly was in the back of my mind!

<p>I think the point is to do better on out-of-order cpus, simply because those are currently in a lot of use. Probably with older in-order cpus we maybe see improvement but this isn't the objective here.</p>

<p>Well there are quite a few SBCs still in use that use in-order CPUs, and although it might not be in wasmtime's main targets, I believe cranelift itself does cast a wider net for deployment targets. It would at the very least be interesting to see if the critical path metric gives us anything in ILP. Of course, our main target should probably still be LUC for register spilling — something that (as Jamey Sharp mentioned) we expect to give more universal improvements.</p>

<p>I just looked again at the paper that proposed LUC+CP for instruction scheduling. <br>
They used SPEC2006 for their benchmarks. Most of the INT2006 benchmarks didn't show any improvement. In FP2006 they did very well in some benchmarks.</p>
<p>They said that the FP benchmarks have more workload than INT benchmarks and this is why the performance was increased there. </p>

<p>Hello, after a while!</p>
<p>While we have somewhat stagnated with progress, for our convenience I tried adding an <code>--emit-opt-clif</code> option that follows <code>--emit-clif</code>, but prints functions after a (possible?) egraph optimization. It can be currently found in the latest commits of our main branch from <a href="http://github.com/karouzakisp/wasmtime">github.com/karouzakisp/wasmtime</a>.</p>
<p>I find my solution a bit hacky in a specific place, probably due to my inexperience with the borrow checker. I didn't yet bother with possible cli checks (like whether the paths for <code>--emit-clif</code> and <code>--emit-opt-clif</code> are the same) because I'm not sure how you would like the cli to behave anyway. Also, I believe the <code>--emit-clif</code> option is supported by a wasmtime/cranelift "explorer"? — I have not done anything there...</p>

<p>Cool, and good questions! The general reason that projects like this ask people to open an issue first is so that we're aware of what people are working on and can offer advice before you get too far into a project. It can be disappointing to write a bunch of code and then find out that it might not make sense to merge it, as you know, so when we can help avoid that outcome it's nice. But when you already have code written, there's no need to open an issue, at least in my opinion. I would suggest opening a pull request that contains only your changes for <code>--emit-opt-clif</code>; it sounds like a useful bit of work by itself. If there are things you feel are important to improve before merging it, feel free to mention those in your pull request, but I wouldn't worry about integrating this mode with <code>wasmtime explore</code> or anything; that can be done in later work if necessary.</p>

<p>I believe the paper we draw from also notes an increase in spills — with an increase in execution time. Although for their spills, it might be that they compare with a more traditional scheduler as a baseline.</p>

<p>I agree, that's not intuitive to me. Sounds like you have a good plan. Also I want to note that the approximation that Chris suggested is not measuring how many values got spilled but rather how many times spilled values got moved around, which is subtly different. It's a useful measure because it probably correlates better with execution time, but it might be confusing depending on what you're trying to figure out.</p>

<p>The other thing you can try, if you come up with any guesses about specific situations where the heuristic might be making choices you don't want, is to add tracing that helps you find examples of those situations, and then run the compiler with that tracing enabled on a reasonably large input like Spidermonkey.</p>

<p>It's often helpful to write things out like this, especially when you're not sure whether you have it right, and I think it's an interesting thought! I guess the situation where the heuristics should matter is when the same value is used multiple times, so it isn't a tree, right? I don't know.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's kinda what I had in mind.<br>
Thinking prematurely ahead of time, it might be interesting to see if we could apply the heuristics depending on some summarizing descriptors for basic blocks...</p>

<p>If there exist patterns strong enough to separate basic blocks into groups that would benefit from different scheduling polices, that is.</p>

<p>That kind of approach can be great, especially if some heuristics are slow to evaluate but you can quickly prove they won't help sometimes.</p>

<p>I think we need to check how many LUC collisions we have, since LUC is supposed to help with spilling. Then one approach is to revert back to the data-driven scheduling. Another approach is employ a more sophisticated algorithm only to some blocks.</p>

<p>Following the discussion above, I drew a small example to gain stronger intuition on it:<br>

<p>Obviously, I don't really consider it a strong indication of any pattern — but it did give an idea: we probably should initialize the LUC heuristic with negative values depending on how many new values an instruction generates. Isolating the choice between (e) and (h) in the example, I believe this would result in a preference for scheduling (e) -&gt; (g) -&gt; (h), which would at least save us from an increase back to 5 live values from 4.</p>

<p>It makes sense to me intuitively. While we like removing live values by scheduling last users, we should also probably consider how many values those last users generate. The heuristic might also need a new name if we decide to make this modification...</p>
<p>I'll probably implement this and report back if we gain anything.</p>

<p>Note that the paper specifically targets an in-order CPU. IMO with a OoO CPU you're better off scheduling to minimize register pressure instead.</p>
