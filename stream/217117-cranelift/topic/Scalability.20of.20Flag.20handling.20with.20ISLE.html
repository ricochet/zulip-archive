<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I'm trying to port icmp for aarch64 over to isle and I've got to the part where I need to think about flag consumers and producers and, in our case, a consumer that is also a producer. I don't think this is currently supported? Looking at the current helpers in prelude.isle, it's slightly intimidating to think about adding another value to ProducesFlags and/or ConsumesFlags value... This appears to be a non-trivial task and I'm wondering if the complexity is really necessary?</p>
<p>In my basic view, we just want to emit a bunch of instructions together, not reorder them, and ensure the flags aren't clobbered by anything else. Can we not have a constructor that takes an arbitrary number of instructions and emits them, either producing a Reg or ValueRegs?</p>
<p>cheers!</p>
