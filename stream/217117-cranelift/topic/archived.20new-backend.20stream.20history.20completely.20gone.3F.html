<p>We archived #cranelift-new-backend just a few hours ago, but now I've discovered a possible downside to archival (vs... something else?): there's no way to view the history, as far as I can tell. That's a lot of valuable design discussion lost. Possibly we could bring it back and just rename to something else? cc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="234973">@Till Schneidereit</span></p>

<p>Hmm, actually, a bit more searching (for message content I knew should be there) shows that the stream exists at this hidden URL: <a href="#narrow/stream/fd9a1d4!DEACTIVATED.3Acranelift-new-backend">here as fd9a1d4!DEACTIVATED!cranelift-new-backend</a>. Maybe we could rename it to "cranelift-backends-2020" or something similarly date-stamped to make clear it's obsolete?</p>

<p>hum, that is indeed unfortunate—it'd be much nicer if Zulip had a way to prevent posting in a channel, but without making it so hard to find. Even more unfortunate is that currently there's no way to undo the archiving, see this help entry: <a href="https://zulip.com/help/archive-a-stream">https://zulip.com/help/archive-a-stream</a></p>

<p>could you mail support to see if they can manually undo it?</p>

<p>At least worth a try, yes. I emailed support, so we'll see if there's anything they can do</p>
