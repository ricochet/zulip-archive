<p>Hello everyone! I recently started learning Rust, and was looking to contribute to the Rust compiler. In the process, I learned that rustc also uses Cranelift as a backend for code generation. Consequently, I have studied Cranelift's code base and have gained basic familiarity with it.</p>
<p>One of the project ideas for the Rust foundation for GSoC 2024 was the implementation of a quick register allocator that would be focused on making compile times faster.</p>
<p>I am really interested in this project, and hope to start making useful contributions to both Cranelift and the Rust Compiler, so I wished to ask for advice on how I can start contributing to Cranelift, and if there are any open areas for work. Also, if anyone could provide pointers on how and what issues to pick, I would really appreciate it!<br>
I have good understanding of compiler theory, and basic understanding of Assembly so I hope I would be able to pick up things fast.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will keep looking for open issues.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!<br>
Vinayak</p>
