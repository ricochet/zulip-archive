<h1>Motion to finalize with a disposition to merge</h1>
<p>I'd like to propose that we accept this RFC by merging this PR. I'm labeling the PR with the <code>motion-to-finalize</code> and <code>disposition-merge</code> labels. As described in the RFC, I'm tagging stakeholders of affected projects, which right now are the core collaborative projects Cranelift and Wasmtime. Given the fundamental nature of this RFC, I'll go even more broad in whom I'm tagging for sign-off, by including regular contributors (very arbitrarily defined as having contributed 5+ commits with 100+ lines changed in the last 3 months), regardless of whether they're committers or not, in addition to contributors to this particular RFC, and representatives of the BA members.</p>

<p>Once the FCP has ended, or at least one member of each stakeholder group has signed off — whichever comes first — this PR can be merged and the FCP accepted.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I do think there's value in defining at least the skeleton of further process for stakeholder disagreement now, rather than the first time we need it (when tensions and stakes may be higher); evidence from other communities (such as Rust) suggests we will eventually need it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for raising this, @joshtriplett. I agree that we'll need this, but there's a tradeoff between trying to get all related processes in place and getting this core process formally instated. We should certainly not put it off indefinitely :) I filed #6 to track this.</p>

<h1>Entering Final Call Period</h1>
<p>Since we have sign-off by members of multiple stakeholder groups and no blocking concerns have been raised, I'm moving this RFC to Final Call. That means it'll be merged in 10 days from now, or once the remaining stakeholder groups have signed off on it, provided no blocking concerns are raised in the meantime.</p>
