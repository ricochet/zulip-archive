<blockquote>
<p>In principle this seems reasonable, but I'll note that this will break a number of links across the Internet -- scattered throughout GitHub comments at least, and e.g. some of my own links in recent blog posts. We should probably have a defined standard for "stable link to an RFC": do we link to the PR itself (and then keep an up-to-date link in the PR's first comment to the final markdown path)? Or something else?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My thought was that post-migration, every PR would include an update that puts the PR number in the file name. From then on the RFC name/path shouldn't need to ever change and a link to the PR or the file can be used to identify it permanently.</p>
<p>As for handling existing links to RFC files that would no longer be correct, the only way to avoid breaking them that I can think of is to make the accepted folder essentially an archive keeping all of the files therein but replacing the contents of each with a link to the actual RFC in some new folder where all of the files are numbered. The issue being that this would make the structure of the RFCs repo a awkward/confusing.</p>
<p>Is there any way to estimate the amount of these links that exist in the wild?</p>

An alternative to break old links would be to rename the files  and then to add new files with the old name which only include a link to the new place.</p>
