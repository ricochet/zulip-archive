<p>Hey folks. Hope this is the right place to ask this. Let me know if there is a better venue if not.</p>
<p>I am writing a program in Rust which has a WASM based plugin system. I am trying to figure out if wasmtime or wasmer is the best way to go in terms of a runtime.</p>
<p>One of the core requirements of this Rust application is that it needs to run both natively and in the browser (with the application itself being compiled to WASM). </p>
<p>In the wasmer crate, they have a JS feature which allows you to do this by  using the execution  javascript environments own WASM compiler instread of cranelift etc ( <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmer/latest/wasmer/#overview-of-the-features">https://docs.rs/wasmer/latest/wasmer/#overview-of-the-features</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run Wasmer in a JavaScript environment — With the js Cargo feature, it is possible to compile a Rust program using Wasmer to WebAssembly. In this context, the resulting WebAssembly module will expect to run in a JavaScript environment, like a browser, Node.js, Deno and so on. In this specific scenario, there is no engines or compilers available, it’s the one available in the JavaScript environment that will be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was wondering if wasmtime had a similar feature / ability? I think I would much rather use wasmtime but this would be a deal-breaker if not possible</p>

<p>I would recommend looking into using the <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">WebAssembly Component Model</a> instead of targeting a specific runtime. That way you get the ability to use the results in any runtime implementing the component model, instead of being at the mercy of a specific runtime's trajectory.</p>
<p>Right now, there are pretty solid implementations in wasmtime and JS (via <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco">JCO</a>), but at least WAMR and WasmEdge are working on implementations as well</p>
