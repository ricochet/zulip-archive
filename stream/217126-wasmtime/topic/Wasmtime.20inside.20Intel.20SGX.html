<p>Hi folks, I am trying to build a version of wasmtime that can run inside an SGX enclave. Wanted to understand what it takes and how I could go about it? since Wasmtime is written in rust. I found project Wamr which has a sgx option, but the project we are working on is heavily dependent  on wasmtime and making wasmtime working inside an enclave would be amazing for us.</p>

<p>Personally I don't know much about SGX myself so I don't know a good answer to this. I don't think many of the other maintainers are really all that familiar with SGX either. There's an SGX target for Rust although I'm not sure how well maintained that is.</p>

<p>you might look at the enarx project</p>
