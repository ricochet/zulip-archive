<p>I have a wasmtime embedded in a go program. I am seeing some weird things when I try to start a program.  The program's entry point is called from go and for this program:</p>
<p>func main(){</p>
<p>log.Printf("a\n")<br>
   log.Printf("b\n")</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>One would receive the output "a" but nothing else and, according to the return value returned to the go level, the program exited and returned no value.</p>
<p>Seems to me that the.problem is something in the WASM world, probably in the go/wasmtime interface.  Is there a way to turn off the JIT in crane lift?  I'm on a Mac with AARCH64 architecture.   Is there any way to get a trace from wasmtime so I can see exactly where the program exit is coming from?</p>
<p>thanks<br>
Ian</p>

<p>Could you perhaps clarify a bit? You say that Wasmtime is embedded in a Go program, does that mean you're using the <code>wasmtime-go</code> bindings? You mention another Go program, but that one doesn't mention Wasmtime. Is that a program compile to wasm and running in the aforementioned embedding? If so how did you compile the Go program here?</p>
<p>If you can run the program in the <code>wasmtime</code> CLI then you can set <code>RUST_LOG=wasi_common</code> to get a strace-sort-of-output for all syscalls. That doesn't have backtraces on it, though, which it sounds like that's what you want. Traps, which <code>proc_exit</code> in WASI corresponds to, should have backtraces on them so if you're using <code>wasmtime-go</code> you should be able to inspect a trap for its backtrace.</p>
<p>Given all that, though, I'm not sure why you're also asking about turning off the JIT? You cannot do that with the C API (which <code>wasmtime-go</code> uses), but additionally if you turn off the JIT there's no way to run wasm unless you have a precompiled module, but at that point you're not really turning anything off, hence my confusion of why turning off the JIT is mentioned here.</p>

<p>Yes, I am using <code>wasmtime-go</code> and the go program I gave is one that I compiled to WASM that I was attempted to run via getting a Func that points to the start symbol and calling it.</p>

<p>I'd recommend reproducing that in the <code>wasmtime</code> CLI then as that should be a bit more of a controlled environment</p>

<p>One option is <code>--default-values-unknown-imports</code>. Another is <code>--trap-unknown-imports</code>. If neither of those works then the CLI won't work, yes</p>

<p>Yeah, well, I'm doing some shenanigans with linking to allow go programs to run in wasmtime.  Have there been changes to the way wasi is "used" by wasmtime?  I don't actually support wasi (I have my own implementation of the functions that just print something and return.)</p>

<p>The fact that it gets to main and <em>then</em> seems to return mysteriously makes me think it's something about the fact this is running on AARCH64.  I mean I don't see how the example can get to main() and then execute ONE LINE and not the second before returning. I am wondering if wasmtime is crashing in some way that gets trapped and then it gets returned to me in the go world as a "returned with no value."<br>

<p>ah well once something executes surprisingly there's quite a lot that could be going wrong, but I think it'll be difficult to help you remotely debug without a reproduction</p>

</blockquote>
<p>FWIW, we've had good support for aarch64 for about three years now, and it's regularly fuzzed; I understand the impulse to suspect the complex codegen under the hood but I'd be very very surprised if a compiler bug were responsible for your program exiting early. Or at the very least, there's no reason to think aarch64 is any more suspect than other architectures -- it's actually a slightly older backend than our current x86 one.</p>
<p>Re: "turning off JIT", as Alex notes you'll need a precompiled module then, and the compiler that produces that precompiled module is exactly the same compiler that produces the JIT'd code. The only difference is when the compiler runs. I suspect you're wanting an interpreter instead; unfortunately Wasmtime doesn't have a Wasm interpreter, it must compile to native.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="254389">@Chris Fallin</span> I'm frankly not one to jump to the conclusion it's the infrastructure (wasmtime) because I was once told by a wise engineer, "ALWAYS assume it's YOUR code that is broken."  However, after about 3 days of studying this and experimenting with it, the fact that the first line of code runs and later ones don't is VERY hard to explain with _some_ kind of error coming in from out of band.  I'm going to do some other experiments today and if I figure it out I'll advise.</p>

<p>PS: It <em>also</em> might be a problem with wasmtime-go and its use of cgo to call into the infrastructure that is rust based.  Frankly, I think cgo is a bit rickety.</p>
