<p>Hi all - does anyone have any tips on where i can get started as a new contributor trying to get acclimated to wasmtime/cranelift's codebase (e.g. a good first issue to tackle or high-level docs on  the codebase)? I looked at issues labeled "good first issue," but the only one i saw was #1272. I don't have too strong of a compilers background, but I'm hoping to change that :)</p>

<p>Hey, I would like to start contributing to Wasmtime, but I'm not quite sure where to start. There are a few old beginner issues, but I'm not sure if they still have people working on them. I am also fairly new to rust so would probably need some mentoring, is that a thing people have time for? It's quite a lot to ask, as I can imagine maintainers "waste" quite a lot of time on mentoring new contributors that don't stick around, but at least a no would be appreciated <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>
<p>Tldr:<br>
Are there any good first issues that don't currently have someone working on them, and do you have time to deal with inexperienced contributors?</p>
