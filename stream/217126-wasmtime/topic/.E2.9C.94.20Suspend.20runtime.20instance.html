<p>To help us better document this, I'm curious if there was something you searched for or places you checked to find information on this? We've gotten questions like this a few times so I'd love to make sure this is well-documented. Most of the documentation is <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.async_support">here</a> right now but that's not necessarily discoverable</p>

<p>I looked through the <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/index.html">wasmtime docs</a> with words such as "suspend", "freeze", and eventually with "interrupt" stumbled onto <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.epoch_interruption">epoch_interruption</a> and through that the concepts of epochs and fuel but I struggled to understand them and thought they were interrupt based rather than asynchronously managed.</p>
<p>I think that the major difficulty with information on this front is that the features are changing and expanding a lot and will likely continue to change in terms of what's expected until WASI and WIT are finalized. Further while wasmtime can easily be described as a "wasm runtime" to conceptually understand all that it does is much harder as an end user and a mdBook detailing what wasmtime is and does would likely really help. I do however want to stress that I think this idea of a book should be done after WASI and WIT are finalized as it would be likely redundant to build on sand.</p>
<p>The only thing I could really recommend is example projects with an asynchronous epoch implementation as the only one that exists presently is using a trap. With a lot of these features a rudimentary example goes a long way in showing what can be done and how it works. That all having been said I'll try to make a basic example of this with tokio and submit a PR, so hopefully that could help</p>

<p>thanks for the feedback, this is quite useful! I'll try to see if I can't also help incorporate this into our docs</p>
