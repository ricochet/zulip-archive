<p>Silly Q, but my boss made me ask it anyway :)</p>
<p>If i take 2 component models, A and B, A depeneds on B, they don't have any other dependancies, and link them together into module C, where C doesn't have any WIT style exports, just regualar exports, can I convert that wasm into an old Core Wasm, I'm assuming the answer is no here, I think its because:</p>
<ol>
<li>There will be 2 core modules in C, which are A and B</li>
<li>A and B inside C have its own memorys</li>
<li>Other reasons I'd like to know about</li>
</ol>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>The terminology you're asking with is somewhat imprecise and it's making it difficult to answer from my perspective, so before I go much further answering this I want to help confirm/clarify some terminology you're using:</p>
<ul>
<li>"If i take 2 component models, A and B" - I believe you're referring to components here as opposed to "component models". A component is a <code>*.wasm</code> binary whereas the component model is the name of the whole proposal to WebAssembly.</li>
<li>"and link them together into module C, where C doesn't have any WIT style exports, just regualar exports" - if C is a core WebAssembly <code>*.wasm</code> then there's no defined way to link a component to a core wasm module. This would require engaging other possible conventions/idioms/tools, so it's not clear to me what this operation would be. I'm also assuming "regular exports" here in this case are exported functions from core wasm using integers and such.</li>
<li>"can I convert that wasm into an old Core Wasm" - if you set aside the "well core wasm is turing complete" argument then, no, there's no general way to decompile a component into core wasm at this time. That would require a relatively fancy tool which doesn't currently exist.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I think overall the answer is "no", but moreso because there's a mismatch in what you're trying to do in terms of components and core wasms</p>
