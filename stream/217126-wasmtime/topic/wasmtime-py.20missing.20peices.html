<p>Hey, so our work has a critical dependency on wasmtime-py and we were hoping to get an overview of exactly what it has missing today with respective to say, something like JCO. </p>
<p>Our usecase is a library that is available in multiple language ecosystems like Js and Python. The library has a wasm based core authored in Rust and it works well enough but we'd love to move all the custom OS integration stuff to be based on top of wasi 0.2. wasmtime-py is not there yet for this it seems and I'm trying to see if there's something we can do about this.</p>
<p>So far, I have identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support imported resources</li>
<li>preview2 shim on top of python std?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything other big missing pieces?</p>

<p>Hello! So far wasmtime-py has mostly been a side project of me (and I'm by no means a Python programmer/expert) so in that sense I may be the only to answer here. In general the wasmtime-py bindings don't really have much in the way of support for components. Bindings for WASIp2 are a major part of that but in general resource support is entirely lacking. One of the major reasons for this is that wasmtime-py leans heavily on Wasmtime's C API which does not have component support at this time. </p>
<p>There's two major routes that can be taken for work like this for wasmtime-py to support components (assuming that's mostly what you're interested in):</p>
<ul>
<li>One is the route of jco which is to flesh out support for "generate python bindings for this single component". That generally means that components can't be dynamically loaded at runtime and instead have to be statically enumerated once to have bindings generated for them. Furthermore this means that it's entirely up to wasmtime-py how to implement WASIp2 which is likely no small feat.</li>
<li>Alternatively the Wasmtime C API would be enhanced with support for components entirely, and then wasmtime-py would "just" bind to this support. That would mean that the current bindings generation might largely go away in the wasmtime-py project since there'd now be native support for components. I'll note though that this is additionally no small feat because making a C API for the component model is a big undertaking (much less mapping it all to Python)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall greatly expanding the component support of wasmtime-py is likely to be a sizable project to take on, and is generally why it hasn't happened already. Personally I've wanted to "one day" get around to the second route here, full support for components in the C API, but I haven't gotten to it yet (and don't have concrete plans to do so at this time). </p>
<p>If you're interested to help tackle this I'd be happy to chat in more depth about what might be necessary!</p>

<p>Hey, thank you, that's very enlightening. I looked around the state of the C API with regards to component support and it does indeed seem on the tricky side.</p>
<p>It does seem like investing in the first route you laid out would be misguided seeing that it'd need to be re-written the moment the C API adds support for the component model. Though I'm not clear by what you mean by the C API obsoleting the need for the binding generation. Do you mean that the <code>Val</code> and <code>get_func</code>/<code>call</code> APIs would be good enough for this need?</p>
<p>I'm also unclear how in the second route would absolve wasmtime-py from having to implement wasip2. Is the aim to provide baseline support for the standard <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> impl in the shared library?</p>
<p>Alas, I'm at a loss how to continue. One path that appears to me is to add support to <code>wasmtime-py.bindgen</code> with all it needs to generate host bindings for the wasip2 APIs. Basically, route one but instead of having a full blown wasip2 impl in Python, we'd implement the specific APIs we're interested in downstream. This is only a marginal improvement over authoring custom host interfaces for FS stuff but it'd mean we avoid this cost on targets like JCO and wasmtime-rs.</p>
<p>Concretely, this means adding support for things like resource imports though I reckon that are a few other missing things. Any thoughts on this? I'll discuss all of this with the team I guess, thanks again.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Right now the bindings generation that wasmtime-py has for components is along the lines of: given a single static component generate Python code, built on the core wasm support that wasmtime-py has, that represents the component. None of this is necessary though if wasmtime-py had native support for components because then loading a component would just look like "load this component" and then you'd interact with it as if it were an <code>Instance</code>. </p>
<p>There might still be some use in generating Python source with type annotations now that I think about it though. The major guts of the internals though would likely all go away and "just" rely on the native component support if it existed.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It's mostly that it would enable you as an embedder to instantiate components that import. Components which import wasip2 need to get that from somewhere, and currently in wasmtime-py the way it'd work is all of wasip2 would have to be implemented in Python. If wasmtime's component support were used then wasmtime's implementation of wasip2 could be used so no Python would be need in that regard.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was discussing this with some folks in the BA Summit this week as well, and I think that the C API for components might be more tractable than I originally thought. If you're interested I'd be happy to chat more in-depth about what would go into that and help set you up for contribution if you'd like?</p>

<p>Hey, thanks for more answers. I don't think the team/job would commit to the C API contribution path today but I'd personally like to contribute this in my own time. I haven't done a lot of C mind you but I'm knowledgeable in Rust and have done other manual memory stuff like Zig. </p>
<p>I've looked at the POC PRs on this item and it seems the biggest work is around the <code>Val</code> question and resource support. Where do you reckon I should start?</p>

<p>I think <code>Val</code> is the main stickler at this time, so I'd recommend creating an API around that first. Basically a C API that can navigate a Rust-based <code>Val</code> without _too_ many inefficiencies I think is reasonable. For example it might make sense to have lots of "view" structs that are opaque in C and pointer-sized in Rust so you're passing around <code>&amp;Val</code> or <code>&amp;Record</code> or similar and that might be able to work out? (I'm not entirely sure though)</p>
<p>The dual of <code>Val</code> is <code>Type</code> which will also need access to inspect and cover as well.</p>
