<p><strong>Given</strong> I take an ordinary WASM component (single threaded) and provide Python bindings to it,<br>
<strong>When</strong> I call it from <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a> by using its <a href="https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/concepts/lazy-api/">lazy api</a>,<br>
<strong>Then</strong> I can see my application crash with hints to <strong>wasmtime</strong> and different <strong>threads</strong> in the <strong>stack trace</strong>.</p>
<p>Hence, my hypothesis: wasmtime and Polars crash over some concurrency issue.<br>
Therefore my question: Is wasmtime (python) thread-safe? What do I have to consider when using it in a multi-threaded environment?</p>
<p>P.s. The error does NOT appear in case that Polars application is explicitly executed in a <strong>single threaded</strong> way.</p>
<p>P.P.s. I do not see such weird exceptions when using the same WASM component in a highly concurrent Tokio (pure Rust) application.</p>

<p>I take it you're using <code>wasmtime-py</code>?  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="253994">@Alex Crichton</span> would know more about the internals there, but yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if the API is not thread-safe.  Maybe we need to add some explicit locking and/or defer everything to a worker thread.</p>
<p>When using the Rust API for Wasmtime, the compiler catches any <code>Send</code>/<code>Sync</code> violations, so you tend to get thread safety by construction, but I imagine there are no such guardrails in the Python API (or the C API on which it is built).</p>

<p>Python itself will make it thread-safe due to the GIL if wasmtime-py isn't releasing the GIL itself. But if you're doing something outside of Python or wasmtime-py is releasing the GIL then there could be a race condition.</p>

<p><code>wasmtime-py</code> is basically a Python API on top of a C API on top of a Rust implementation, so presumably the problem is in one of the lower layers beneath Python.</p>
<p>BTW, Alex will be unavailable until October 22nd (and might not remember the details regarding this anyway), so <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="595146">@Christoph Brewing</span> if you need a quick fix I'd recommend conservatively assuming <code>wasmtime-py</code> is <em>not</em> thread safe, meaning you should refactor your app so all the Wasmtime calls happen on the same thread.</p>

<p>Assuming the C API type <code>wasmtime_store_t</code> is just a handle to a <code>wasmtime::Store</code>, then the fact that the latter is not thread-safe would imply the former isn't either.  In Rust parlance a <code>Store</code> (and handles to it) is <code>Send</code> (meaning it can be passed from one thread to another) but not <code>Sync</code> (meaning it can't safely be shared among multiple threads simultaneously).</p>

<p>The <code>wasmtime-py</code> package uses <code>ctypes</code> in Python which I believe means that the GIL is released whenever Wasmtime-native code is executing. That means that there's no protection against concurrency, and that's a known issue with <code>wasmtime-py</code>. There's <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py/issues/217#issuecomment-2035373713">some discussion in an issue</a> which I never got around to making a dedicated issue for though, so the "known" part is "well at least it's in my head" which I realize isn't the most useful...</p>
<p>In any case Joel is right in that the Store is the main part here. Without any protections in Python (which is a bug in the <code>wasmtime-py</code> library) the thread-safety story in Python is the same as that from C. That means that you can for example use a <code>Module</code> on multiple threads (and <code>Engine</code> too) but <code>Store</code> can only be used on one thread at a time. All instances/functions live within a single <code>Store</code> so you can't, for example, call two functions on an instance in parallel on two threads.</p>
<p>To directly answer your initial questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore my question: Is wasmtime (python) thread-safe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not currently. It's subject to the same requirements as the C API. This is a bug in <code>wasmtime-py</code> I'd love to see fixed one day, however. (sorry you're running into this)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do I have to consider when using it in a multi-threaded environment?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The general rule of thumb is a <code>Store</code>, and everything that works with it, should stick to a single thread. It can move around as a "unit" between threads, but can only be used on one thread at a time. The <code>Engine</code> and <code>Module</code> types are threadsafe.</p>
<p>The <code>Linker</code> type is also safe to use across threads, so long as the method isn't mutating the <code>Linker</code>. For example a linker populated with <code>define_func</code> is safe to use across threads. A <code>Linker</code> populated with <code>define</code>, however, is not.</p>
<p>Linker "accessors" such as <code>get</code> or <code>instantiate</code> should be safe to use across threads though.</p>
