<p>I wanted to know about various metering options in Wasmtime and which one seems to be performant. My aim is to get number of instructions executed (during runtime and not number of instructions in the WASM binary) when I do <code>call_async</code>. I see there is something called <code>fuel</code> but read that it might have performance concerns.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.consume_fuel">Fuel</a> was initially the only option but <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.epoch_interruption">Epoch-based interruption</a> should be more performant for most use cases especially those centered around preventing DOS/infinite-looping components.</p>
<p>I think that if you want to get the <em>exact number</em> of instructions executed you may have to use fuel, but the mapping isn't quite so easy -- <a href="https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Store.html#method.set_fuel"><code>set_fuel</code> docs note that *most* instructions consume one unit</a>, but there are some that consume 0, so not sure how pedantic you want to be in that area.</p>

<p>thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="598440">@Victor Adossi</span> for the reply. I may not want the exact number of instructions executed but a measure of it being linearly proportional to it would be fine, so for example I might be okay with 0 costed instructions using fuel. Is there a way for it in Epoch based interruptions ?</p>

<p>So epochs are time based -- they don't really work at the instruction level, so it's completely divorced. Depends on your use case of course, but if you can identify some period of time that makes sense to segment as epochs, then you <em>should</em> be able to achieve a similar result... I think also epoch-based limitation also fits quite well with a lot of scheduling theory/how various schedulers (below WASM in "the stack") work as well.</p>

<p>yeah that's a good suggestion. I was interested in this naive instruction count because of concrete number and associated pricing (for the product). for epoch I think I could do how many epochs passed in executing that wasm function and have pricing per epoch.</p>

<p>Ah so if the idea is tied to pricing I think you could definitely do better with a time-based restriction -- this is how most compute platforms will charge right, the idea of "compute seconds" or something similar</p>

<p>There is also the aspect of "noisy neighbor" interference: billing based on wallclock time gives one an unpredictable amount of work for given cost because we're timeslicing on the async executor threads. If you want deterministic and explainable billing, fuel alone is the only way to go</p>

<p>Maybe this wasn't clear --  my interpretation of the request was that while fuel is the only precise way to count the actual instructions used, setting the instruction count low and actually <em>stopping</em> frequently was probably not desired. </p>
<p>If I understood @spino17's desire right, they wanted an accurate count of of the number of instructions executed, and I responded that fuel was the way to do that (with some caveats on instruction counting) -- I don't think there was a misunderstanding there.

<p>I think we might be splitting hairs here -- I still consider a virtual/logical clock that is incremented in line with a physical one to be time-based (never mind that you still have access to the <em>actual</em> system clock during the callback), but that's neither here nor there.</p>

<p>Right, yes, I understood the proposal; my main point is that this will be slower. I studied the performance of fuel-counting mechanisms extensively when I came up with and implemented epochs; the overhead exists whether you use fuel to actually interrupt, or just to count execution steps. Additionally adding the epoch checks -- which are another set of instructions on every backedge -- will only slow down execution further.</p>
<p>So: we want to count execution precisely; so we need to flip the "fuel" switch on. We can set the fuel reserves to <code>u64::MAX</code>, never take a fuel interrupt, we're still paying the cost. Now we need a way to periodically interrupt and context-switch back to the caller. We can use fuel -- which we've already paid the instrumentation cost of -- by setting some fuel reserve less than <code>u64::MAX</code> -- or we can turn on epochs, which will add <em>another</em> set of instructions to every backedge. Both have roughly the same interuption cost (a call back into the runtime), but epochs will add yet another slowdown factor.</p>
<p>Fuel checks consist of two parts: load-decrement-store on "used fuel", and a compare-and-branch to see if that crosses zero. The latter is very cheap (almost always correctly predicted); almost all the cost is in the load-and-store traffic. In particular the latencies (three or four cycles each for ld and st) and the store-to-load forwarding is painful on modern CPUs, and hard for the instruction scheduler to predict. We need to store back to memory at least across every callsite, because we don't have a custom calling convention that pins the value in a register (doing so would be a perf tradeoff to evaluate; unclear if always a win). All that to say: the cost is in the counting, not the checking.</p>

<p>While we're here though, I'd love to hear how would you actually solve this, @Chris Fallin ? Would you go for purely fuel as a solution?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, definitely, for all the reasons above. Epochs were designed to be used only when one doesn't need the deterministic counting of fuel.</p>

<p>Fuel checks consist of two parts: load-decrement-store on "used fuel", and a compare-and-branch to see if that crosses zero.

<p>Thanks for the thorough explanation here -- this really solved misconceptions I had about where the cost was.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="254389">@Chris Fallin</span> for the complete picture. This makes much sense now and I should move forward with fuel approach only then. Thanks again <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="254389">@Chris Fallin</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="598440">@Victor Adossi</span> for the help and the above elaborate discussion.</p>
