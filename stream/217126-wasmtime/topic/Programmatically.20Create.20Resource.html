<p>Is there anyway to do this? I would like to test out my event loop and have mocked out most of the external things. One part that is catching me is I wouod like to create a programmable resource that is pollable? Is it possible? If not I will just mock that as well</p>

<p>This sort of depends to the degree to which you're mocking. Arbitrary host resources can be made at any time with <code>Resource::new_{own,borrow}</code>, all you need is a 32-bit number to put in there. If that number never ends up being used, for example the resource is never passed to <code>wasi:io/poll</code>, then it doesn't matter too much what the number is. If you want to create an arbitrary real pollable resource then you'll need to use the same pollable type as <code>wasmtime-wasi</code>, and the crate isn't 100% built for mocking but it should be possible since I think that one is trait-based.</p>
<p>For guest-defined resources there's no way to mock those out, they have to come from the guest</p>

<p>Awesome this worked out well for me thank you!</p>
