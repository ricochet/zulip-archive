<blockquote>
<p>As of today, there's a concept of constant pools in Cranelift, that works for SIMD 128-bits values. I'd like to extend it to work also for float32 and float64 values, to avoid the need for the bitcast, which I'm sure is pretty terrible performance-wise (and doesn't help register allocation either, since it requires one GPR register with a very short lifetime).</p>
<p>My current plan is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>uimm128</code> immediate could be reused to store any kind of constants, since it contains an <code>ir::Constant</code> (handle to a vector of bytes of any size); it would be renamed to <code>constant</code>.</li>
<li>a new instruction <code>load_from_constant_pool</code> would be introduced, taking an input <code>constant</code> value.</li>
<li>vconst right now can be inserted in the constant pool only from the parser. It'd be nice if this were done during codegen itself. We could recycle "expand_fconst" to do this and legalize vconst / f32const / f64const into a <code>load_from_constant_pool</code> with the right Constant.</li>
<li>we switch the encodings of vconst to work for load_from_constant_pool on the same types; and we add encodings for f32/f64.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aligning the constant pool values would be nice to have but not required at this point; it would just be a performance fault on x86.</p>
<p>@abrown Does it sound reasonable to you?</p>
