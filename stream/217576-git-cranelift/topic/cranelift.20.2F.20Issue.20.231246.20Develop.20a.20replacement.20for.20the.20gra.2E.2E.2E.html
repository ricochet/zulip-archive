<blockquote>
<p>Cranelift's existing register allocator has proven to be a limiting factor for<br>
achievable code quality.  Typically it limits the performance of compiled<br>
WebAssembly inputs to around 80% of that achieved when compiling WebAssembly<br>
via SpiderMonkey's Ion pipeline instead.</p>
<p>In particular, the allocator generates excessive spilling.  This is because it<br>
doesn't implement live range splitting.  Investigations have shown that while<br>
it would be possible to implement splitting, this would make the allocator run<br>
significantly more slowly.  But the allocator already dominates Cranelift's<br>
compilation time, and is already uncompetitively slow.  So this isn't a<br>
promising route.</p>
<p>The current plan is to implement two new allocators:</p>
<p>(1) A traditional linear-scan register allocator, in the style of Poletto and<br>
    Sarkar's paper [A], but not tune it much, at least at first.</p>
<p>(2) At the same time, implement a backtracking, top-down allocator similar to<br>
    that used by SpiderMonkey's Ion pipeline, and in LLVM 3.0's optimising<br>
    mode, as summarised at [B].  Experience with Ion indicates that this<br>
    allocator provides good quality allocation whilst being significantly<br>
    faster than graph colouring schemes.  Hence it seems like a good choice.</p>
<p>The purpose of doing (1) is threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One area of uncertainty/schedule risk with implementing a new allocator is<br>
  figuring out how to integrate it into CL's existing IR and<br>
  machine-instruction infrastructure.  Starting off by implementing a simple<br>
  core algorithm frees up time to explore the integration aspects, which are<br>
  arguably the more difficult problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may be useful for some users of CL to have the choice of a faster<br>
  allocator (hence, overall compilation) at the expense of poorer quality<br>
  code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It gives a baseline for speed comparisons, both compilation speed and speed<br>
  of generated code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether, and to what extent, it is necessary to translate out of SSA prior to<br>
doing register allocation is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>In order to avoid any interruption in service for existing CL users, the<br>
existing register allocator will be kept alive until such time as a new<br>
implementation can do better, both in code quality and compile time.</p>
