<blockquote>
<p>Cranelift uses arrays and indices extensively, rather than pointer-based data structures. This allows us to use 32-bit indices rather than 64-bit pointers on 64-bit platforms, and has some other nice properties, however these indices appear to Rust as random accesses, so they get bounds checked.</p>
<p>The following patch to disable bounds checks in <code>PrimaryMap</code> speeds up Cranelift compile times by over 8%, which is considerable:</p>

<p>Of course, this is not completely safe.</p>
<p>But, the common pattern of these indices in Cranelift is to use them relatively safely. We don't use this indices for iterating; we use custom index types that don't even permit arithmetic. Most <code>PrimaryMap</code> keys are produced by <code>PrimaryMap</code> itself when we push new entries:</p>
<p>let key = my_primary_map.push(x); // returns the key of the newly pushed element</p>
<p>These keys are in bounds from the start.</p>
<p>Yet, there are some ways things could go wrong. Besides a few minor details which a relatively easy to fix, there are a few deep problems. Nothing outright prevents keys from living across calls to <code>clear()</code>. Similarly, nothing prevents indices from living while we exit a <code>PrimaryMap</code>'s scope and then re-enter it, creating a new <code>PrimaryMap</code>. And, while we use distinct index types to catch using an index in the wrong map, and don't tend to use more than one instance of <code>PrimaryMap</code> with the same type at a time, nothing enforces that.</p>
<p>We don't tend to do the kinds of things which would lead to trouble. But all the same, disabling the bounds checks is not completely safe.</p>
<p>So I don't yet know what the best thing to do here is. Should we add a cargo feature to allow users to decide whether they want the safe or unsafe version? Is there a way to do what we're doing in Rust safely without paying for bounds checks? Should we re-architect Cranelift's core data structures to some other form?</p>
