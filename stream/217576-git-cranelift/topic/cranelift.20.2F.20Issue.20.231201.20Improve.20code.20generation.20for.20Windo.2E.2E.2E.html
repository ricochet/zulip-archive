<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the feature or code improvement you would like to do in Cranelift?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Improve the code generation for Windows x64 ABI (fastcall) to reduce function size by omitting frame pointers, using the caller-provided shadow space as spill slots (for optimized compilation), and potentially omit prologues/epilogues entirely (for "leaf" functions).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the value of adding this in Cranelift?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Reduced code generation size and improved performance on optimized compilations when targeting Windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>
  algorithms to use?**</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows x64 ABI has strict requirements for function prologues and epilogues.  This enables the OS to consistently walk and unwind the stack during exception handling.</p>
<p>Because of these strict requirements, a frame pointer is rarely needed for the purpose of unwinding and is only required for a frame doing a dynamic allocation (i.e. <code>alloca</code>).  However, keeping the frame pointer may mean <em>smaller instruction sizes</em> based on the displacement from a frame pointer vs. the current stack pointer.</p>
<p>Additionally, an explicit stack frame is not necessary at all for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention" target="_blank" title="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention">"leaf" functions</a>.  We can omit prologue, epilogue, and unwind information generation entirely for functions that don't:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have any stack allocation.</li>
<li>Call another function (i.e. "leaf").</li>
<li>Have a need to save non-volatile registers (i.e. limited only to modifying volatile registers).</li>
</ul>
<p>I therefore propose the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Favor omitting the frame pointer unless there's a call to dynamically allocate stack space (if ever supported) or such that the size cost of the function outweighs the benefit of having an additional GPR.  Note: the current implementation expects that the pushing of the previous frame pointer will realign the stack prior to the call to <code>layout_stack</code>, so omitting the frame pointer will impact this assumption.</li>
<li>For unoptimized compilation, home register-passed function arguments into the caller-provided shadow space so debuggers can find the arguments even without debug information.</li>
<li>For optimized compilation, consider the caller-provided shadow space to be scratch and treat it as "preallocated" spill slots for the current frame.  However, it looks like this may violate some layout assumptions in <code>layout_stack</code> and require more consideration.</li>
<li>Detect if the function is leaf (based on the definition above) and skip prologue and epilogue generation.</li>
<li>Skip allocation of shadow space if a function does not call.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result should be smaller function code generation on Windows, especially in the case of leaf functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they better<br>
  or worse than your proposal?**</li>
</ul>
<p>I have not considered alternative implementations.</p>
<p>This issue was motivated by #1199.</p>
