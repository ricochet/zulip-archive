<blockquote>
<p>Basic blocks have been default-enabled for a while. Speaking with @bnjbvr, the project has decided to keep moving forward on replacing Ebbs with Blocks.</p>
<p>The remaining points of work to finish that transition are:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Removing the "basic-blocks" feature-gate on the relevant code.</li>
<li>[ ] Mass-renaming "ebb" to "block", etc., throughout the code and the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I think we should keep something that is effectively Ebbs as an internal detail for the wasm IR to CLIF IR translation. They create a de-facto list of blocks that are jump targets, which is a useful optimization for the efficient algorithm we use to convert to SSA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm going write a commit to do the mass rename now. I believe the plan is to rename to <code>Block</code>.</p>
<p>So for example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Ebb -&gt; Block
EbbNode -&gt; BlockNode
EbbData -&gt; BlockData
ebb -&gt; block
</pre></div>


<p>One potential issue is that <code>ebb</code> is used extensively throughout the codebase as a short variable name, and renaming to <code>block</code> will increase the identifier length by two. In my opinion this could increase readability, but might be too verbose for some peoples taste.</p>
<p>Let me know if anyone has objections or a different proposal for naming.</p>

<p>I agree, that I prefer <code>Block</code> instead of <code>Bb</code> for the entity name. Rust's capitalization rules penalize two letter acronyms for types, and it's rare to type out the type name with inference.</p>
<p>For variable names though, I'm open to <code>bb</code>. I suppose it's kind of weird that technically expands to <code>basic_block</code> when it's referring to just a <code>Block</code>.</p>
<p>I think <code>blk</code> is a little ambiguous and I'm a bit averse to shortening names by dropping letters in the middle of an identifier, unless it's an acronym, as I think it hurts readability.</p>

<p><code>Block</code> looks good to me. The only thing that hasn't been noted is that there's a thing in the repo already called a <code>BasicBlock</code>, which is a sub-component of an <code>Ebb</code>. It would probably be confusing to have both <code>Block</code> and <code>BasicBlock</code>, so even in the interim, maybe you might rename the latter to something like <code>EbbBlock</code>? That would make it clear that it's a legacy thing.</p>

<p>I think this has been finished with #1365, is there anything else that needs to be done?</p>

<p>abrown closed <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1303" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1303">Issue #1303</a> (assigned to sstangl):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basic blocks have been default-enabled for a while. Speaking with @bnjbvr, the project has decided to keep moving forward on replacing Ebbs with Blocks.</p>
<p>The remaining points of work to finish that transition are:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Fixing <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1159" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1159">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1159</a> (thanks @bjorn3)</li>
<li>[x] Removing the "basic-blocks" feature-gate on the relevant code.</li>
<li>[ ] Mass-renaming "ebb" to "block", etc., throughout the code and the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I think we should keep something that is effectively Ebbs as an internal detail for the wasm IR to CLIF IR translation. They create a de-facto list of blocks that are jump targets, which is a useful optimization for the efficient algorithm we use to convert to SSA.</p>
