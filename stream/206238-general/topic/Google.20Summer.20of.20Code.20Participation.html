<p>Hi, sorry if this is off-topic.</p>
<p>Will the ByteCode Alliance be taking part in Google Summer of Code 2024? I would love to get involved in the WebAssembly community and start contributing. I also like the idea of a committed mentee-mentorship partnership aiming to complete a project, which is provided by the GSoC framework.</p>
<p>Kind Regards, Max :)</p>

<p>That would be really wonderful. We'd need a volunteer to head this up. I believe it involves applying as an org first and then we would also need a group willing to mentor and sponsor a project.</p>

<p>FWIW, in spring 2021 I put together an application for GSoC on behalf of BA; unfortunately we were not selected, but I can say at least that the effort on our end was ~1 working day to collect ideas and write up the application.</p>
<p>There's still an old issue with a few project ideas for Wasmtime, some of which may still be relevant (and I'd have to imagine a bunch of project ideas now exist with the component-model work): <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2667">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2667</a></p>
<p>I'm on parental leave now so I can't lead any 2024 application but personally I think it could be worthwhile re-applying, perhaps taking a bit more time to understand what they're looking for; unfortunately there was no feedback on the rejection before</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is follow up  question based on above discussion. I am trying to build a project that aims to use Wasmtime and Cranelift as dependencies. I would like to contribute more to these projects in order to understand things in deeper levels. If Bytecode Alliance is participating in GSoC 2024 then I would love to contribute and develop a healthy mentee-mentorship partnership. Is there any update regarding this? </p>
<p>Thank you,<br>
Riya</p>
