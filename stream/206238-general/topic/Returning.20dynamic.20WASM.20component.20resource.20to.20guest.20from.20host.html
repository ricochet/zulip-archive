<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="477605">@Robin Brown</span> we talked on fedi a bit about a "dynamically-typed wasm component resource."</p>
<p>I'm working on implementing WASM scripting in my game engine. The game engine has an ECS, which can store ECS Resources. Often times, these ECS resources can be kind of big, so I wouldn't want to marshal them to the guest. Instead I would want to create a WASM component resource. The issue I'm running into is that in the <code>get-resource</code> WIT function on the World interface, I must return a typed resource. Rust represents a resource with <code>Resource&lt;T&gt;</code>, so I must know the type when writing the function implementation.</p>
<p>You mentioned that I could offer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A) way to fallibly "downcast" a resource to a target type or to turn it into a variant of the possible concrete types either as a method or standalone function</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm interested in how you could represent that in WIT. I'm experienced in Rust, but still relatively new to WASM and Wit. Thanks for the help!!</p>

<p>Here's how what I was talking about maps to WIT roughly</p>
<p>Version with "downcast" (it's just a function)</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="wit"><pre><span></span><code>interface ecs {
   resource ecs-resource {

      to-camera: func() -&gt; result&lt;camera&gt;;
   }

  resource camera { ... }
}

// or a separate function for each one if they need to be added by additional interfaces
interface camera {
   use ecs.{ecs-resource};

   to-camera: func(r: ecs-resource) -&gt; result&lt;camera&gt;;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Version where you convert to a variant of concrete types</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="wit"><pre><span></span><code>interface ecs {
   resource ecs-resource {
      ...
      // have a method that turns your resource into the corresponding concrete type

  resource camera { ... }

   variant concrete {
      camera(camera),

<p>Ohh, that makes sense. I actually do similar things like that with Asset handles, not sure why I didn't think about doing it for this.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm not sure how else I would do something like this with WIT though. I do intend that the user would create a higher level api over the low level api provided through the WIT files. Right now I feel like I'm working around WIT's restrictions tbh. I felt similarly when implementing Lua though tbf.</p>
<p>It would be great to have a wit function that directly translates to <code>World:get_resource&lt;T&gt;()</code>, but I have to expose a lower level api, then the user can create higher level wrappers that expose a similar api to what the host would have. That's actually what I'm doing with a C# package.</p>

<p>The issue is that <code>get-resource&lt;T&gt;: func() -&gt; T</code> isn't a concrete type. It's a family of functions (or a "type constructor") and two components could only soundly compose if they provide and use the same concrete functions. Otherwise, what happens when I call <code>get-resource&lt;U&gt;</code> for some <code>U</code> the exporting interface hasn't implemented?</p>
<p>On the other hand, it makes a lot of sense to be able to want to write WIT generically over some types and let a given implementation fill in those types to choose its concrete type. However, this is no longer a concrete interface or world. We've taken to calling these higher-level constructs "WIT templates" and the parameters "holes" iirc.</p>
<p>There has been some discussion and experiments around what this might look like but I believe it will be quite some time (on the scale of years) before they're high enough priority compared to other work (like preview 3 async) to get fully implemented since they're very complex.</p>

<p>Yeah, "templates" or "generics" would be perfect for this. But like you said, it will take some time until that is implemented. I think the only option currently I have is to return an error, or none if <code>U</code> doesn't implement that interface. If you have any other ideas for ways I could implement this in current WIT spec, I'm open ears!</p>

<p>My colleague Brian Hardock and I started to implement WIT Templates last year, but shelved it because it was becoming a distraction from more important things.  See <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/964">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/964</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/pull/541">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/pull/541</a> (both of which are hopelessly out of date by now).</p>
<p>I'd love to pick that back up someday, but as Robin said, it's still not a high priority.</p>
