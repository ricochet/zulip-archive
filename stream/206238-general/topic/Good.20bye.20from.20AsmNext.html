<p>Greetings! I have come to bid farewell to everyone. I am the leader of AsmNext, a team that recently ended its membership with the Bytecode Alliance as of April 30th. We used WAMR in our 2022 project and sought assistance from the BA to help us apply it smoothly.</p>
<p>During the development of a new embedded application using WASM, we encountered issues with stack guard pages and JIT. As my level of hardware-related knowledge is not high, this was a challenge. It was during this time that we learned about the BA and decided to join for information sharing purposes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we did not have any business opportunities this year, so we could not extend our membership with BA. However, we are grateful for their help over the past year, which enabled us to resolve many issues. We express our appreciation to BA for actively providing us with appropriate advice.</p>
<p>We are now operating a separate channel to continue our ongoing interest in WebAssembly. If you are interested, please feel free to contact us at @asmnext@catswords.social (ActivityPub)</p>
<p>Thank you. :)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="480431">@Namhyeon Go</span> , a pleasure to have you here. Please remember that though the organization of the BCA was proud to have you and understands why you might not continue to be a formal organization member, the engineering is always here, in the open, in the repos. So don't be a stranger; if there's questions or answers we'd love it if you stay around in our community of engineers.</p>
