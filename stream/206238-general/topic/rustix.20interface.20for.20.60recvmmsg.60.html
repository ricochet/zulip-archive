<p>Hi, I'm trying to make a PR to add sendmmsg/recvmmsg (note the extra m) to rustix. <code>libc</code> has these functions in linux_like, which I gather is a hard requirement. However, I have a few questions as I go:</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks like the BSDs have sendmmsg, but it's not a syscall. Does that mean it should be only for linux?</li>
<li>The interface is shaping up to be pretty unwieldy, something like <code>msgs: &amp;[(&amp;[IoSlice&lt;'_&gt;], &amp;mut SendAncillaryBuffer)]</code>. That's not even getting into the return type. Should I go straight to a higher level interface, maybe something like a builder pattern, or just slog through with that?</li>
<li>The <code>msghdr.rs</code> interfaces are not well-suited to this (see <code>with_noaddr_msghdr</code>). Is that designed specifically to avoid allocation or something? Should I try to adapt those or just do without?</li>
<li>Should I just give up and cry?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Edit: thinking more, I think it <em>has</em> to be a builder pattern, or you can't mix sockaddr types easily. Something like:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It can go either way. rustix aims for "syscall-like APIs", and <code>sendmmsg</code> is pretty syscall-like. That said, if it's more complex, it's ok to defer for now too.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that <code>sendmmsg</code> is just an optimization, compared to making multiple <code>sendmsg</code> calls. As such, my guess is that it's better to go for the lower-level interface, since a builder would likely impose a dynamic allocation which users looking to optimize would want to avoid. That's just a guess though, and not a hard rule.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>My guess is that that existing infrastructure won't work well for you as-is, if you need to support multiple addresses in a single <code>sendmmsg</code> call.</p>
<p>As a possible alternative, I wonder if this would work: have a public type <code>MMsgHdr</code>, that contains a single private <code>mmsghdr</code> and is <code>repr(transparent)</code>. Give it constructors for constructing it with different address types and data and control messages. It probably needs lifetime parameters. And a method for reading out the <code>msg_len</code> value. And then let users do their own builder-like thing with a <code>Vec&lt;MMsgHdr&gt;``, or their own fixed-sized </code>[MMsgHdr; N], or whatever, as they see fit, and pass it into <code>sendmmsg</code> as a <code>&amp;mut [MMsgHdr]</code>. Since it's <code>repr(transparent)</code>, rustix could pass the raw slice into the <code>sendmmsg</code> syscall. Do you think something like that might work?</p>

<p>Even the lower-level interface would require allocating <code>msghdr</code> structs, so it wouldn't save any allocations. Also, the performance benefit is usually from the reduced number of syscalls, not from the allocations, but that's a fair point.</p>

<p>Yes, that seems doable! FWIW, the <code>MMsgHdr</code> is just a <code>msghdr</code> and a len, so it would be potentially usable for single-M <code>sendmsg</code> as well.</p>
<p>Also, there's the question of the return value. The syscall returns the number of messages succesfully sent, and the amount of each message sent is saved in in the <code>mmsghdr</code>'s length field. Hence <code>Vec&lt;usize&gt;</code>. One benefit of the builder pattern thing is that you could offer a <code>remaining()</code> method to filter out everything that's already been sent, but maybe that's too high-level.</p>

<p>Hm, so, I spent some time poking at this, and unfortunately I don't think <code>repr(transparent)</code> works very well.</p>
<p>The problem is that <code>msghdr</code> is just a bunch of pointers:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="C"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">msghdr</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="w">         </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">msg_name</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">       </span><span class="cm">/* Optional address */</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kt">socklen_t</span><span class="w">     </span><span class="n">msg_namelen</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">    </span><span class="cm">/* Size of address */</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">iovec</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">msg_iov</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">        </span><span class="cm">/* Scatter/gather array */</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kt">size_t</span><span class="w">        </span><span class="n">msg_iovlen</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">     </span><span class="cm">/* # elements in msg_iov */</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="w">         </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">msg_control</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">    </span><span class="cm">/* Ancillary data, see below */</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kt">size_t</span><span class="w">        </span><span class="n">msg_controllen</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="cm">/* Ancillary data buffer len */</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="w">           </span><span class="n">msg_flags</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">      </span><span class="cm">/* Flags on received message */</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If I have <code>RecvMMsgHdr</code> with a constructor like <code>new(iov: &amp;mut [IoSliceMut], control: RecvAncillaryBuffer)</code>, then I can ensure with lifetimes that the iov pointers and control buffer pointer are safe to store on the <code>msghdr</code>. But that's not true of the sockaddr. I could require a <code>&amp;mut SockAddrStorage</code>, but I don't have a way to communicate whether the memory is valid after the call (it depends on whether the kernel set <code>msg_namelen &gt;= 0</code>, I think).</p>
<p>It would be reasonable to allocate the sockaddrstorage on behalf of the user, but I don't have anywhere to store the pointer, since it's <code>repr(transparent)</code>.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Since this issue is unique to recvmmsg, I pushed a PR with just sendmmsg: <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/pull/1171">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/pull/1171</a></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not a type wizard, would you be able to sketch out an example of what you mean?</p>
<p>Another idea I had would be to make a <code>RecvMMsgBuffer</code> utility with something like <code>fn grow(&amp;mut self, len: usize, mtu: usize)</code>. It would maintain a slab of memory for contents/cmgs/sockaddrs and a <code>Vec&lt;mmsghdr&gt;</code>, and let you iterate over filled messages. The goal would be for it to be reusable, obviously.</p>
