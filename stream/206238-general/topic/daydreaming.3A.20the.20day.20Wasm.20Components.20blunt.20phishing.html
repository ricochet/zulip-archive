<p>I look forward to the day where email and link standards have evolved to know what to do with Wasm Components, or compressed components, or links to components. Apps like mail clients and messaging clients could then be configured to only accept such artifacts that can be run in a safe sandbox tool like <code>Wasmtime</code> or something derived from it, recognized as a safe vehicle for viewing what someone has sent you.</p>
<p>Of course there will always be socially engineered attacks, but it's frustrating that our OSes can't protect the common person from malicious links because, I guess, their default browsers and other default apps can't be trusted against zero-days.</p>
