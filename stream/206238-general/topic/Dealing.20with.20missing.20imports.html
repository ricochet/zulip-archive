<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Right now it is not permitted to have missing imports in a wasm module as it's considered corrupted and it will not execute. This means that for situations that for the scenario where you have in the wild various versions of a WASM host that exposes functions to be used by a binary, you need to create separate WASM files for each version that's out there.</p>
<p>Things like this aren't possible right now:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">vm_host_has_feature</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"feature_name"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">     </span><span class="n">call_function_from_vm_because_it_should_exist_here</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">else</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">     </span><span class="n">fallback_bhv</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Given this scenario is semi common (e.g. someone may want mods built for new versions of the game to work on the old version too. It's not really a good developer experience for people to maintain pipelines that output X binary versions that are guarded by <code>#[feature]</code> flags and it would be nice to allow imports to be missing.</p>
<p>The behavior for when you call a missing imported function is that you get a trap.</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions:<br>
1) Why is the standard not allowing my proposed behavior? What's the reason to ask for all imports to be there?<br>
2) Could we have a build option / feature flag on WASMTIME to allow for this?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Alex</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="298375">@Alexandru Ene</span>, this came up in a recent issue, too: <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2587">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2587</a></p>
<p>The tl;dr is that we want to avoid a proliferation of non-standard interfaces that might tie the hands of the WASI standardization effort later on. However, I agree that there's a real need to satisfy here, too. Do you think <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2587#issuecomment-765386694">my suggestion</a> in that thread would be a viable solution for you? And if so, would you be up for adding support for such a flag?</p>

<p>If that permits imports that aren't found to be replaced by a trap if called, allowing the module to run it is a great solution! Thanks <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span></p>
<p>I can start work to add it on my side.</p>
<p>What would be the best way to propose this change to the WASM standard to relax that requirement on imports?</p>

<p>Hmm, good question. I'm not sure where it best fits in, but perhaps the WASI subgroup might be the right place? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="254083">@Dan Gohman</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="254124">@Lin Clark</span>, what's your take on this?</p>

<p>Yes, the WASI Subgroup has a design for <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/design/optional-imports.md">Optional Imports</a> which does this.</p>
