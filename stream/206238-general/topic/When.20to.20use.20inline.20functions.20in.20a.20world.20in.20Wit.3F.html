<p>Besides interfaces, a world can contain inline functions. What's the use case for this?</p>
<p>The docs[^1][^2] specifically mention that such a component can't be composed with other components, only if the world contains only interfaces.</p>
<p>[^1]: "to use your component from another component, it must export an interface." <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/language-support/rust.html?highlight=must%20export#exporting-an-interface-with-cargo-component">source</a></p>
<p>[^2]: "The component's world (.wit file) must export an interface. (Do not export functions directly, only interfaces.)" <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/creating-and-consuming/running.html#running-components-with-custom-exports">source</a></p>

<p>my observation as a user was that "export and import functions" was the default about a year or so ago when I started toying with wit, but the closer we got to preview2, the more problems arose with directly exported functions and it feels like they should be deprecated soon. I don't know if that's correct, as I said that's what I experienced from the outside</p>

<p>The use case depends on the world in question, mostly the perspective from an embedding. For example it might be a good model for what the host wants to give a component or what the host would require from a component.</p>
<p>The limitations in the documentation refer to conventions around the <code>wasm-tools compose</code> subcommand. That's not a limitation of components or component runtimes in general, so it might be something worth clarifying in the documentation but I wouldn't say for sure without reading more closely</p>
