<p>When I was naming the project I knew about JAWS the screen reader, but I didn't think it would lead to any confusion as when you google for JAWS you get mostly pages about Jaws, the movie. A screen reader user mentioned that it's already sometimes hard to find information about JAWS in context of the browser (like javascript developer tools). @benmccann from SvelteKit suggested the name could be Jawsm (pronounced like awesome) and I like that, so I changed the name to avoid any confusion.</p>

<p>Given the maturity of the current WASI 0.3 prototype by Joel I feel you could take a look at it for any newly starting projects, as async becomes so much easier with 0.3. Feel free to ask questions here, I adapted the code for native compilation and found it easy to understand, given Luke's excellent presentation in Barcelona.</p>

<p>Also Joel will likely present more about it tomorrow at WasmCon.</p>

<p>Thanks for the info <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="590366">@Christof Petig</span>, that's exciting! For now I'm using few functions from WASIp2, mostly <code>subscribe-duration</code> and maybe I'll add outgoing HTTP requests at some point to test things, but a broader WASI integration will come when I get to more builtin types and especially Node.js APIs. Which makes it even better, cause by the time I'm there, I'm guessing WASI 0.3 will be used more widely.</p>
<p>The only potential issue I can see is runtimes support. The code I'm generating is already hard to run almost anywhere without host extensions. For now I added a few simple pollyfill functions to mimic WASIp2 in Node.js/Chromium, but my aim is to be able to run on top of a bare runtime without any custom code. If Wasmtime gets WASI 0.3 support anytime soon, I will definitely give it a shot.</p>
<p>At the moment another blocker for using Wasmtime is the exception handling support, but when I finish await/generators I might just have the tools to rewrite <code>try...catch</code> into WASM code that doesn't need the feature.</p>

<p>I have a small, but I think exciting update: I have a first working PoC of async/await handling in JAWSM. I think there are some edge cases that it doesn't handle yet, but it handles <code>await</code> statements in conditionals and loops, so the rest is definitely doable. When I wrote the first post in this thread, on 9th of November, I said I'm working on async/await, but I dropped the work afterwards. The project was just not ready for that in terms of stuff supported then, and most importantly because of very limited tooling. Now that I generate most of the WASM code from Rust, adding new features got easier. On top of that, I also worked on a tool to traverse and modify WASM code, which made it much easier to implement.</p>
<p>I'm very happy with it, because this is one of the last two things that I still didn't confirm are doable (the other thing is generators support).</p>
<p>For those curious on the details, I use a WASM code transformer that splits WASM code at the <code>await</code> point, saves the state and the stack and restores the state. The effect is kind of similar to asyncify, but a bit more integrated into how I translate JS code. And also rather than unwind the entire stack I do more of a CSP style transforms, ie. a function using one await statement will become two functions - first function will keep everything before the <code>await</code> keyword and the second function will be called once <code>await</code>ed promise is resolved.</p>
