<p>Im interested in the idea of using cranelift as a target for a language that can compile down to bare metal riscv for building kernels and embedded systems. Does bare metal riscv work quite well with cranelift?</p>

<p>Cranelift's riscv backend is new, so I don't think anyone has much experience using it. We have pretty good confidence in the portions that are exercised by Wasmtime (with caveats; I believe there's no SIMD support for example). I wouldn't draw any conclusions about using it on bare metal from that. Your best bet may be to try it and see! Note that there's no support for inline assembly in Cranelift, so if you need any privileged instructions, or stack switching, you'll have to wrap those in separate functions and call them from your Cranelift-generated code.</p>
