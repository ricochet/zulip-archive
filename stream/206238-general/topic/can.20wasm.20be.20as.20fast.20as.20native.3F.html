<p>A game project i am interested in ( unvanquished ) is going to switch to wasm for its scripting code, which it runs on its own process. I am wondering whether safety checks ( function pointer and bounds check among others ) could be turned off in that situation, to improve performance</p>

<p>That being said if you have test cases which perform significantly worse than native (e.g. 50%+) please feel free to open an issue and we can take a look.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="253994">@Alex Crichton</span> there are sandboxing checks that you have to make in order to guarantee safety, but if you want to give up safety for performance, a lot can be done. There are still some fundamental limitations with the WASM instruction set, but compiling let's say via LLVM (I think WasmEdge is doing that) with no runtime checks and all optimizations enabled can get quite far I think.</p>

<p>It is this point that I want some clarity. If it starts with WASM, and it runs in wasmtime, and then it runs in this "something else entirely" and produces the same answer, why is it not WASM anymore?</p>

<p>In other words, why cannot WASM be defined as "a given .wasm file runs in wasmtime and doesn't fail."? And as long as this is satisfied, we are free to create "fast runtime" that gives up safety for performance. You can always run the same wasm file in wasmtime and get all the safety guarantees.</p>

<p>In my mind the difference is the possible inputs. To be the same as wasm you have to perform the exact same as the wasm under all possible inputs, not just one. For example if one input causes wasm to report a <code>call_indirect</code> signature mismatch but an "unchecked" build went and crashed a different way, that's how they're different.</p>
<p>If <code>call_indirect</code> never crashes for a wasm build, then an "unchecked" build was applying an optimization  that the wasm compiler wasn't smart enough to do but could have done, but that's a different realm of optimization as opposed to simply turning off checks.</p>

<p>Disabling wasm checks can indeed change semantics, for example it could cause crashes to happen at different times which means that any amount of other code could run in the meantime. For example host imports could be called after what would have otherwise been a crash</p>

<p>I have a lot of experience with precisely this thing:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">huge_out_of_bounds_index</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>and in Fortran for example (and LFortran), the workflow is that you first compile in Debug mode with bounds checking on. If your code runs for a given input without any runtime errors, then you can turn the bounds checking off and run fast. Then if in production things misbehave due to out of bounds (quite rare actually in my experience for computational physics codes), you recompile and re-run in Debug mode.</p>
<p>Here is a similar example. LPython has the following guarantee / contract: if your Python code compiles in LPython and runs in Debug mode without any runtime errors (such as bounds checking), then we guarantee that exactly the same code on exactly the same input also runs in CPython and produces the same answer (as well as when recompiled with LPython in ReleaseFast mode). Would it mean that LPython is not Python? Well, it's not exactly the same as CPython, but given the contract, it definitely guarantees some subset of Python.</p>
<p>Coming back to WASM. Take our existing fast WASM-&gt;x64 (x86_64) backend. We guarantee the following (assuming no bugs in our compiler, which currently is not satisfied): if a given LFortran's code compiles and runs in Debug mode via our WASM-&gt;x64 backend and produces the right answer without any runtime errors, then the same <code>a.wasm</code> should run in wasmtime and produce the same answer (as well as running in the browser!), as well as in our WASM-&gt;x64 backend in ReleaseFast mode. For the same inputs. In  my mind we are supporting a subset of WASM, in a well defined sense of this paragraph.</p>

<p>I think the point is that your "WASM-&gt;x64 backend" <em>isn't</em> a wasm backend, its a "subset of wasm produced by certain compilers" backend. It could not (presumably) compile any arbitrary wasm input into a binary that follows the wasm execution spec. That is fine in an integrated toolchain, but you wouldn't want to use it for potentially-malicious input as many wasm runtimes expect.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="480579">@Lann Martin</span> yes, you definitely can't use it for malicious input. You can't use our ReleaseFast backend (even via LLVM) with malicious input. Only Debug and ReleaseSafe.  Yes, I think you are right: it's not a WASM backend that can accept malicious wasm file or malicious input. It's a "subset of WASM produced by certain compilers".</p>

<p>One thing that I think is missing from the above discussion: the "bounds checks" are actually <em>built into the semantics of Wasm</em>. Even a subset of Wasm -- say, Wasm modules that would not have trapped in the original execution -- <em>require</em> the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Wasm abstraction for memory is a 32-bit (for now) region and Wasm pointers are offsets into the region. The fastest way we know how to compile this is to have a 4GB+guard area of virtual memory in the host process, and compile all Wasm memory accesses to <code>heap_base + offset</code>. That <code>heap_base</code> needs to live in a register, and the extra addition makes addressing modes a little more expensive (e.g. if the original program could do <code>[base + index*4]</code> on x86, we have to compute <code>tmp = base + index*4</code> then do <code>[heap_base + tmp]</code>.)</p>
<p>Note here that the slowdown is related to the semantics, not to the checks. We could make the region much smaller, and put unrelated data within easy reach of <code>heap_base</code> with no bounds-checks at all; and we still have the slowdown, because it comes from the "hidden heap base" semantics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Wasm abstraction for indirect control flow is a <code>br_table</code> instruction that has a list of target blocks, and a "default" that we branch to if the given index is out-of-bounds. You might say: avoid the bounds-check, and never branch to the default. Except that that is not a never-expected-to-happen-in-safe-executions behavior: it's a builtin feature of the instruction, just like a <code>default:</code> label in a C switch statement, and is used all the time.</p>
<p>If you implement <code>br_table</code> in a way that executes ordinary (safe, non-trapping) Wasm programs correctly, you <em>have to</em> implement a compare-and-use-default-if-over-limit behavior. And once you have that, you have the bounds-check.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what I'm trying to say is: there is <em>no actual way</em> to turn off bounds checks, because the result wouldn't be Wasm. I don't mean that in a philosophical "it wouldn't have the guarantees we like to talk about" way, I mean that in a "it wouldn't run your program correctly because it wouldn't implement the same instruction set" way. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Yes, the "implicit" bounds checks required by the WASM instructions themselves cannot be turned off (you gave two examples: "hidden heap base", <code>br_table</code>, and there is probably more), and even "Fast/Unsafe WASM" must implement those. Consequently, these might impose some (slight) limitations on the maximum performance for "ReleaseFast" mode (fastest runtime, no checks), and so WASM might not be the best fit there. On the other hand, for ReleaseSafe (fast runtime and checks) this might be a perfect fit, using wasmtime for example. And for Debug mode (fast compilation, checks, slower runtime), having our custom fast-to-compile WASM backend might be a good fit.</p>

<p>Maybe instead of supporting a subset of wasm ( programs that will never go out of bounds or otherwise have memory errors), extra memory instructions could be added whose checking cost completely goes away when safety checks are not necessary. I imagine such instructions would be slower to implement otherwise but they could still be useful</p>
