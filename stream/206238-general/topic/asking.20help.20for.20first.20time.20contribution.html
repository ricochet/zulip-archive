<p>Hello everyone,<br>
My name is Vamshi Reddy and I’m an undergraduate student. So, recently I came across Wasmtime and it's amazing. So I want to contribute to this community. So my question is “How can I contribute to this community?”<br>
Can you suggest some non-code contributions?</p>

<p>Great question! You could try using wasmtime to accomplish a specific task, then documenting your process so that other people can learn how to use the tool — for example in a blog post. If you encounter any bugs or pain-points during that process, you can submit them as GitHub issues or tell us what we can improve. You could also clarify any of the official documentation for wasmtime, or engage with the RFCs.<br>
If you'd like to get involved in WASM or WASI more broadly, you could pick an in-progress proposal that doesn't have much documentation, research what people are saying about it e.g. on GitHub or in meetings, and write that down as a pull request to the proposal repo that clarifies the current consensus for people, or put together an external explainer that helps people understand the proposal. (And of course if you have your own great ideas, feel free to propose them to the rest of the community!)</p>

<p>Those are the ideas that come to mind for me, but people better acquainted with wasmtime might be able to give more specific suggestions for how to help wasmtime.</p>
