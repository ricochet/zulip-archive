<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been looking for an example of this behavior, and if one exists, consider this question answered.</p>
<p>I have a custom Rust runtime using wasmtime to run component model apps/plugins, all of which are so far written in Rust as well and use the same WIT file by running <code>cargo_component_bindings::generate!()</code>. What I'd like to do next is create a Rust library crate for all of these apps/plugins to deduplicate the boilerplate code that comes along with various serialization steps and trait implementations for the types defined in my WIT file.</p>
<p>When I try to do this by creating a component and <code>use</code>-ing it in another one, I run into all kinds of issues such as the target/bindings/&lt;package&gt;/target.wasm file being in the wrong place for the 'library' and the component doing the import being seemingly unable to reach code in the other component.</p>
<p>It seems like this might be the wrong strategy to do what I want to do -- is there an idiomatic way to do this kind of thing?</p>

<p>If you want to create a Rust crate that effectively is a wrapper around your bindings (either to provide a higher-level abstraction or extending the functionality of the binding types themselves), you'll probably want to use <code>wit-bindgen</code> directly from that crate to do so, and then in the component crate, you have it target an empty world and have a normal crate dependency to the bindings crate from your component itself (in theory that should work, but it doesn't have any test coverage)</p>

<p>Thank you, but could you clarify how to use <code>wit-bindgen</code> to access the functions that my WIT file exposes as "imports"? I can access the types in my interface, but can't find the functions I want to wrap around.</p>

<p>it depends on the imports, but generally they'll generate something like <code>ns::name::iface::func</code>when the world imports an interface <code>ns:name/iface</code> and something like <code>world::func</code> when the world imports a function. i forget the exact paths off the top of my head</p>

<p>Okay, I've been able to do this strategy successfully now for importing the wrapper and using it in a component. I think it's very close to working, I just have one last problem: Since my wrapper runs <code>wit_bindgen::generate!</code>, it won't compile unless I handle the exports and <code>impl Guest for Component</code>.</p>
<p>Then, even though I can impl Guest again in my component that uses the "wrapper", the impl in the wrapper gets used when I use the compiled app in my runtime. Can I set the wrapper up such that it doesn't have to create the Guest, or set up the component so that its Guest gets used in the final thing?</p>

<p>I should clarify that I'm using wasmtime as the runtime for these WASM plugins -- so the runtime is using the <code>generate!</code> macro in wasmtime::component, but the "library" is using <code>wit_bindgen::generate!</code>. This seems to be fine in the sense that I can get the library to execute just fine inside the runtime. I think I just need a way to overwrite the impl inside the "library" when I import it into a plugin.</p>

<p>I have a similar (but I think slightly different) use case: I'd like to generate code just for my common WIT types into a shared Rust crate so that I can attach behaviour to them. I'd then want to have several component crates, all with their own worlds, using that shared crate.</p>
<p>Am I right in thinking that wit-bindgen would need to learn some new tricks for this to work? Namely: filter what wit namespaces to generate code for, and also tell it where to find pre-generated code for a given namespace?</p>
<p>Is this something that is already on anyone's radar? If I wanted to have a think about what this might look like, should I open an issue on the wit-bindgen repo with some examples, or better to post it to zulip?</p>

<p>A late response, but I have solved this exact issue by making a rust library that "wraps" the native wit bindgen generated types, adding useful functions, deriving more traits, etc. The individual plugins can then depend on this library and have a much nicer API to work with than if they used the wit bindings directly.</p>
<p>The library I created for this in one of my projects is <a href="https://github.com/kajacx/LiquiSlimeBevy/tree/master/liquislime-rust-api">here</a>, although the code is a bit outdated and would require some changes to update it to the newest version of wit bindgen.</p>
