<p>Is there a recommended way to share a wit file between different projects? e.g. between the host system (rust), and the guest system?</p>

<p>Not yet. This has been a pain for all of us but took a back seat to wasi 0.2 implementation work in the recent past. I think there will be some improvements in the relatively near future.</p>

<p>I suppose I should make the simplest recommendation in case it isn't obvious: wit tooling can generally take a path to the directory holding the wit files; if your project structure allows for that kind of sharing then I recommend it <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Thanks. I hope there's a nicer solution in the future.</p>
<p>My use case requires that it be shared between users and an arbitrary number of guest systems.</p>
<p>The best solution I could come up with so far is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a separate repo to store the wit files</li>
<li>Add that repo as a sub-repo to the host system, and bindgen from that path</li>
<li>Add that repo as a sub-repo to the guest helper crate, which will do some fancy macro stuff to include_str it from path and inject it into the bindgen! macro directly. Then I can release the crate and it can be directly used by guest systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>An alternative is to fetch the file at compile time, but depending on network access to github at compile-time seems like a bad idea.</p>
