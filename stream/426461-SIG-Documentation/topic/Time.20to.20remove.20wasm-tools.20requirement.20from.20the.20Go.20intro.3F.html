<p>Hi y'all, thanks for the amazing job y'all did with the component-model book!</p>
<p>I'm trying out components with Go for the first time now, and the book <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/language-support/go.html#3-converting-a-wasm-core-module-to-a-component">instructs</a> to run some quite verbose wasm-tools command. However, there's a link to a PR that's supposed to do away with this step, and that PR has been merged a few months ago. Does that mean that this step is no longer needed?</p>

<p>Hi Mendy. To your point, we would like to remove references of <code>wasm-tools compose</code> from the repo and instead use <code>wac plug</code>. So for composition scenarios, we want to use <code>wac</code>; however, wasm-tools is still needed to convert from core module to component, which are steps in both the Go and C guides. Go tooling has improved and I believe we might be able to produce components directly from the go toolchain now and remove use of wasm-tools. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="646597">@Rajat Jindal</span> do you know if this is the case from your investigation on updating the Go docs?</p>

<p>internally go toolchain still uses wasm-tools. There have been some discussions going on around this in wasm-tools-go repository, but I am not following those very closely right now.</p>
