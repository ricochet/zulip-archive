<p>I have some components that use the <code>wasi:http</code> shim to make network calls. I initially assumed these would be totally blocking, but when looking through the <code>@bytecodealliance/preview2-shim</code> code I noticed the <code>lib/io/worker-*</code> files that seem to imply some of the <code>wasi:*</code> backed IO is happening in a <code>Worker</code> and is not blocking. </p>
<p>Curious if this is all piped in with <code>jco</code>'s functionality by default or if I would need to do some special configuration to use the <code>worker-*</code> versions of the shims? I've been exploring instantiating/calling my components in a <code>Worker</code> thread to avoid blocking, but if it is already non-blocking that would be great!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="678052">@Landon James</span> yes we have a "non-blocking" polls implementation but this is only currently supported in Node.js. Supporting the browser is the next priority now that this implementation has been completed, but that work will be a little while still.</p>

<p>Ahh great to hear, I am only looking to support Node at the moment. Do I need to do anything to enable that? I see that the <code>nodejs/http.js</code> implementation is only pulling in the <code>worker-io</code> stuff at the moment, so not sure if that is fully non-blocking yet? Happy to contribute some work here once I figure out what needs to be done since this would be more helpful than wrapping all my own stuff in <code>Worker</code>s.</p>

<p>oh, yeah it should all work out in Node.js if you use the default transpile options - http is fully supported</p>
