It is exciting as we can now start to focus on some pressing and rather interesting questions, like the topics of shared memory, and zero copy ABIs that come with this. I know the WAMR team have already implemented a form of shared memory. Anyway, looking forward to seeing you call on the call tomorrow.</p>",
