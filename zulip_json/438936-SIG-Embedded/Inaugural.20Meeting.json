It is where we will nominate and select co-chairs, and the decide upon or meeting schedule. As you know, our charter is a bit different to the charters from other SIGs. We’re specifically looking to schedule meetings in three time zones, Asia Pacific, Europe and The Americas. This is going to require co-chairs who can join these meetings. It is really important, at least for this first meeting that everyone can join. Unfortunately until we make these decisions, it means that our very first meeting will be a compromise for all time zones. But I really want to make sure that as many people as possible can attend, so to help with this I’ve created a Doodle Poll, which you can see here:<br>\n<strong>Call to Action - &gt; Please do vote!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/bqMqnJGb\">https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/bqMqnJGb</a></p>\n<p>I'm also working with David Bryant to set up a google group, if you'd like to be added to the group please do let me know, with a reply, or alternatively drop me a DM!</p>",
