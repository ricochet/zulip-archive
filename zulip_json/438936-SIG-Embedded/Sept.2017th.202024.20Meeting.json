        "content": "<p>Dear fellow embedded enthusiasts, </p>\n<p>when we internally talked about adding zero-copy IPC to WIT (shared memory) by supporting a <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-write-a-simple-application\">iceoryx2 like API</a> we found that just returning a <code>borrow&lt;list&lt;u8&gt;&gt;</code> from a subscription resource (or a <code>borrow-mut&lt;list&lt;u8&gt;&gt;</code> from a publisher resource) won't cover all of our needs.</p>\n<p>Instead at some point in time we also want to support a <code>borrow&lt;list&lt;list&lt;string&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> as well. But non-constant-size/bounded lists need a heap allocation which clashes with shared memory placement. You probably want to design a new ABI <span aria-label=\"scream\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f631\" role=\"img\" title=\"scream\">:scream:</span> for in-place creation and access of <code>list</code> and <code>string</code> objects, like <a href=\"https://flatbuffers.dev/\">flatbuf</a>, <a href=\"https://protobuf.dev/\">protobuf</a>, <a href=\"https://capnproto.org/\">capn-proto</a> or similar.</p>\n<p>This would be similar to multi-memory support as the addresses in string/vector ABI would be relative to the mounting point of the shared memory. (These addresses could also independently choose between 8, 16, 32, or 64 bit size as long as both side agree).</p>\n<p>I just realized (or was told) that this also can be used to serialize WIT based messages for network protocols, on disk storage, using pre-allocated memory pools for calls (functional safety) and similar.</p>\n<p>Do you want me to prepare a presentation on this for tomorrow's meeting?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-write-a-simple-application\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/934da35557dddaaf4d10e886d3c8dc4307daa228/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f333432343930613964376666353265386233313930656366383537646232633664396165343336306535353362656363373037346365663732363235343664642f65636c697073652d6963656f7279782f6963656f7279782d7273&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-write-a-simple-application\" title=\"GitHub - eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx-rs: Rust wrapper for Eclipse iceoryx™ - true zero-copy inter-process-communication\">GitHub - eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx-rs: Rust wrapper for Eclipse iceoryx™ - true zero-copy inter-process-communication</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Rust wrapper for Eclipse iceoryx™ - true zero-copy inter-process-communication - eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx-rs</div></div></div>",
