I'm working to get the logistics in place to support our initial set of meetings, and to allow us to select chairs. As mentioned in our charter, we'd love to have meets scheduled in each of the 3 timezones; Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas, hopefull with chairs in each time zone to support this. Lot's to do - I'll keep you all posted on progress here.</p>",
