I'm not sure if it is related to the other one mentioned above so I created a new thread for it. I have a working installation that successfully transpiles a very simple .wasm file generated from Rust. It is using 1.1.1. I tried a new installation today and was suddenly receiving an error. I realized that it was 1.2.0 and it appears to be expecting  wasm-tools.core2.wasm to be in the jco tree. It seems to be in the componentize-js tree.</p>\n<p>Here's the error:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jco transpile add.wasm -o out-dir<br>\nnode:internal/fs/promises:638<br>\n  return new FileHandle(await PromisePrototypeThen(<br>\n                       ^<br>\nError: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/brian/src/jco/node_modules/@bytecodealliance/jco/obj/wasm-tools.core2.wasm'   &lt;=============<br>\n    at async open (node:internal/fs/promises:638:25)<br>\n    at async Module.readFile (node:internal/fs/promises:1251:14)<br>\n    at async fetchCompile (file:///Users/brian/src/jco/node_modules/@bytecodealliance/jco/obj/wasm-tools.js:42:32) {<br>\n  errno: -2,<br>\n  code: 'ENOENT',<br>\n  syscall: 'open',<br>\n  path: '/Users/brian/src/jco/node_modules/@bytecodealliance/jco/obj/wasm-tools.core2.wasm'<br>\n}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Node.js v22.0.0</p>\n<p>When I search for it, I see it here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>find . -name \"wasm-tools.core2.wasm\" -print<br>\n./componentize-js/node_modules/@bytecodealliance/jco/obj/wasm-tools.core2.wasm</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I look under my working directory:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>find . -name \"wasm-tools.core2.wasm\" -print<br>\n./jco/obj/wasm-tools.core2.wasm</p>\n</blockquote>",
