Is it something we're maybe interested in supporting better later? Or is that out of scope for <code>jco</code> in its entirety?</p>\n<p>If we care abou deno, or think we might care later, I'll tag the issue with a new <code>target-deno</code> label so we can start to track it. If we don't care about supporting deno, I think we should say as much and close the issue.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/issues/167\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/688e6b912d93b86226ba6d797f59e5cef61e3f69\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f373731646534383131303135666266303136316539643230653037363462326335313766373762613838323363633830316638323935666165326638623066352f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f6a636f2f6973737565732f313637)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/issues/167\" title=\"Cache .wasm files locally · Issue #167 · bytecodealliance/jco\">Cache .wasm files locally · Issue #167 · bytecodealliance/jco</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">When using deno, most of the package files are resolved on the first run and cached.
