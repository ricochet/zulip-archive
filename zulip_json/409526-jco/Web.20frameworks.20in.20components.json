It's still early days, but ideally we could even include Node.js compatibility layers by default, this and other compat will continue to improve over time in StarlingMonkey (<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey</a>), but it should be possible to get quite far with some build configs and some monkey patching.</p>\n<p>Fission may have made some progress here I believe in this, but I haven't looked too closely at it - <a href=\"https://github.com/fission-codes/stack/blob/main/packages/homestar/src/wasmify/index.js\">https://github.com/fission-codes/stack/blob/main/packages/homestar/src/wasmify/index.js</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/73e08a0d9c37f6ec9baf7be278da23c1d2d57e9b\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f353265303962333335643262316561663439343061656264653133313264386539656661613863383734323433386663333934353635383136383763316232632f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f537461726c696e674d6f6e6b6579)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey\" title=\"GitHub - bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey: The StarlingMonkey JS runtime\">GitHub - bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey: The StarlingMonkey JS runtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">The StarlingMonkey JS runtime.

I think part of my problem is going to be that NextJS expects to be run by their CLI, and there's no clear entry point to create a component from. They have support for custom servers like express, but that configuration doesn't have support for server side functions, which is the majority of the reason for experimenting here. Vercel has their documented Build Output API (<a href=\"https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3\">https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3</a>) which is how cloudflare adapts next to run on Workers and I'm thinking this might be the next best router to investigate.</p>",
