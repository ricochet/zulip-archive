        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"707655\">@Tyler Schoppe</span> we will probably be sticking with ESM as that's the primary embedding we need to be thinking about, and supporting two different embeddings may be a bit much from a maintenance point of view. That said, applying Babel can work to convert a component JS to commonjs, both for instantiation mode and normal mode. The tricky thing mainly is more that preview2-shim for any of the WASI builtins is itself an ESM embedding which would need to be reimplemented on CommonJS. Another option might be Node's new require(esm) support under <code>--experimental-require-module</code> which is coming in the next release.</p>",
