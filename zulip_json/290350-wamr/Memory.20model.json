The app heap will be initialized when setting up the linear memory space, also the libc heap will be initialized when the wasm app starts by special wasm function, e.g. the _start function. And the initialization of the libc heap depends on the value __heap_base global, unfortunately, the wasm-sdk compiler doesn't generate the bytecode to read the __heap_base global value (e.g. global.get __heap_base), it just hardcodes the initial constant value of __heap_base in the bytecode, so the initialization of libc heap may overwritten the data in the app heap, in other words, the app heap might be corrupted. And when runtime detects the app heap is corrupted, it reports \"out of memory\" when allocating memory from app heap.</p>\n<p>So please had better use only one of them: only enable app heap, and disable libc heap, for example, hack wasi-sdk's libc.a, remove dlmalloc.o from it; or only enable libc heap by export malloc/free function for runtime, so native side can use wasm_runtime_module_malloc to allocate memory from libc heap.</p>",

Ref to wasm_runtime_full_init and RuntimeInitArgs in core/iwasm/include/wasm_export.h for more details.
