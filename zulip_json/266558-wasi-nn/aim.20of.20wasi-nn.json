Am somewhat unsure what the aim of wasi-nn is, even after reading the repo and chat: is it an abstraction layer (so existing ML frameworks would target wasi-nn instead of specific hardware, and the resulting would be portable) or a full nn framework with support for deserialising models, running inference etc wholly within wasi-nn?</p>",

I'll let <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"254110\">@Andrew Brown</span> respond more fully, but from my pov the intent was to provide an abstraction layer and the result happened to be shaped at the time like what people wanted to use. However, as LLMs exploded, there were clearly areas of the implementation to evolve. That's my take. wasi:nn is intended to provide an abstract api for people to use models portably and with a much higher degree of security.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"712312\">@Kirp</span>, yes, it is an abstraction layer but not at the level you suggest (between an ML framework and the hardware); rather, it's an abstraction layer between WebAssembly applications and ML frameworks. Why? For a WebAssembly application to do ML inference, it would either (a) have to compile an ML framework to WebAssembly (like <a href=\"https://github.com/sonos/tract\">Tract</a> does) and link to it somehow, or (b) make system calls via some interface like WASI. One problem with (a) is that the WebAssembly language is not the most efficient way to execute ML operations and it is limited to CPUs. wasi-nn takes approach (b), but instead of taking on the rather difficult role of abstracting the hardware, it abstracts the ML framework itself.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/sonos/tract\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/63a61b9f8b02452350dde0ad8968f659e51d4b87/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f353863383831343066663433666331626239643462626533353039613534323035643431303232306164376431633362626230663333653430643933656438392f736f6e6f732f7472616374&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/sonos/tract\" title=\"GitHub - sonos/tract: Tiny, no-nonsense, self-contained, Tensorflow and ONNX inference\">GitHub - sonos/tract: Tiny, no-nonsense, self-contained, Tensorflow and ONNX inference</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Tiny, no-nonsense, self-contained, Tensorflow and ONNX inference - sonos/tract</div></div></div>",

At a conceptual level, wasi-nn and Keras both target different frameworks \"underneath\" them.
