Is the idea to add polyfills for common globals that map to the standard WASI interfaces? In a JS host these would then be the counterpart to the jco/preview2-shims. Meaning a component can use a host function as follows: JS code -&gt; ComponentizeJS polyfill -&gt; JCO shim  -&gt; host implementation.<br>\nTaking console.log as an example, you would get: JS code using console.log -&gt; mapped to WASI-logging -&gt; mapped back to host console.log implementation.<br>\nTaking SubtleCrypto in the browser as an example, you would get: JS code using JS SubtleCrypto API -&gt; mapped to WASI-crypto -&gt; mapped back to host SubtleCrypto implementation.</p>",
