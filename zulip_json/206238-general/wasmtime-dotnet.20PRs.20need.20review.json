I haven't been paying attention, but it probably also needs Wasmtime version bumps and releases to NuGet (it's automated, just tag a release).</p>\n<p>If anyone is familiar enough with .NET that wants to take over maintenance, that would be fantastic; there are also two community contributors (GitHub <code>martindevans</code> and <code>kpreisser</code>) that have been invaluable to its development and I think would be great candidates for recognized contributor status and as maintainers of the repo as well.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/bcc5519dbccdf2cadd8f0d13a2415f17337d83ea/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f356662336263393038373161636534663334316337363438653365613166306264316234636637623238663262396538653039376434333163636464663233662f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652d646f746e6574&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet\" title=\"GitHub - bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet: .NET embedding of Wasmtime https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime-dotnet/\">GitHub - bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet: .NET embedding of Wasmtime https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime-dotnet/</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">.NET embedding of Wasmtime https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime-dotnet/ - bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet</div></div></div>",
