As I've been consuming content on WASM and the new component model, I've been wondering how folks would author rust libraries that target specific .wit. worlds? When compiling, is the toolchain able to enforce that no libraries / syscalls are used outside of what's imported in the world? Alternatively, is it possible to target WASI but with compile-time guarantees around the set of WASI host interfaces used?</p>",
