It is possible to run code in isolation, but it does not appear to be designed or intended for being used to import or working with modules. The challenge is obviously how to interface \"nanoprocess\" modules when they share nothing, and I was wondering if there were any examples of platforms working towards such ideas? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"254124\">@Lin Clark</span></p>",

V8 is actively working on interface types, so Node will get that support once they're done. I don't know what their current plans are around module linking, but I could see them potentially tackling that work on the same timeline. </p>\n<p>Once all that is in place, there are quite a few people in the Node community who I know are excited to start applying the model</p>",
