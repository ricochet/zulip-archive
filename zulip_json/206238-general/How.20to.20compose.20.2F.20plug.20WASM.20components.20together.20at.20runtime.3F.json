But what if for example, I'm creating a sandboxed scripting engine for game where user-created scripts? In this case, I don't necessarily want the user to have the main game binary or more importantly, have to pack it into their binary and include the entire game when it's executed at runtime where the main game WASM should already be there and it should be interacting with the memory space of the main game module, and perhaps don't even have access to system calls / io? </p>\n<p>I see that you can define imports for wasm components using Wasmtime in Rust (<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/api/wasmtime/component/bindgen_examples/index.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/api/wasmtime/component/bindgen_examples/index.html</a>), but that seems to require manually defining import bindings and calling the other module, essentially having to link it myself manually through bindings in code. Is there some way to link at runtime with Wasmtime? How do I automatically link the two and allow it to say, access resources and records from the other WASM module at runtime?</p>",

A component can't tamper with the memory space of any other component, so if two components are composed together with <code>wac</code> then the two components can't tamper with each other as they're constrained by the component model APIs they're using to communicate with each other. In that sense you wouldn't have to worry about a user script interfering with another component.</p>\n<p>When working with imports/components at runtime you don't have prior static information about you'll want to use the \"untyped\" APIs. This will involve some reflection on the component at hande and using APIs such as <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/component/struct.LinkerInstance.html#method.func_new\"><code>Linker::func_new</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/component/struct.Func.html#method.call\"><code>Func::call</code></a></p>",
