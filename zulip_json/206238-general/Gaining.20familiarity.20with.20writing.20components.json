Right now I am trying to just make an adder- I was trying to write low level as a wasm component directly rather than targeting an adder from a different language) to get familiar with making standalone components, but was having a bit of trouble understanding the documentation, especially pertaining to making/ writing a component from scratch (linked here: <a href=\"https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org\">https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org</a>).  I did read through it to try and get a better handle on syntax, types, etc.</p>\n<p>From the looks of it, it seems I need to make a command component in addition to my adder component, as the command component would contain the run export which a runtime (in my case I am using wasmtime) can actually use to run the whole system once fully composed. I was wondering if anyone might have a more step-by-step guide, example, or other literature I might be able to read, in addition to what is on the component model website, so I can better understand how I can make this component, and perhaps the process overall. Thanks!</p>",
