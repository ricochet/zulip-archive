        "content": "<p>Hello, I'm curious if there have been any attempts to build an app framework where apps compile to WASM. Android and IOS tend to be a bit boxed-in due to their choice of blessing a particular language for app development.</p>\n<p>To properly support wasm apps, these frameworks could map their APIs (probably a subset of it) onto a WIT world and ship a custom wasm host with the framework itself. Or a particularly ambitious app developer could do the same, providing an app that ships the runtime.</p>\n<p>However this begs the question: What is that WIT interface? What functionality does an app expect from the host and vice versa? How should apps declare required permissions to access host functions?</p>\n<p>Once those questions are answered, I think it's safe to forget Android/IOS entirely. With a proper reactive app framework interface defined, anyone could build a framework for their favorite OS or embedded device.</p>\n<p>I am definitely not an expert on existing app frameworks, so that's why I'm wondering if someone has attempted to answer questions like this before.</p>",
