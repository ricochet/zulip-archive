Is in rust, has a number of algorithms that you can choose, defines a way to inline fast-paths for allocation and barriers.  Also they have good ideas about what an interface between a VM and a GC should look like.  cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"254389\">@Chris Fallin</span></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/mmtk/mmtk-core\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/16c5e54369f58f27809563a7f2cd3eaefb6f3f6c\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f333164323037646437303839646639336530333632303965343035666339633664316365653335363134346263663039373363376364653535626437313539332f6d6d746b2f6d6d746b2d636f7265)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/mmtk/mmtk-core\" title=\"GitHub - mmtk/mmtk-core: Memory Management ToolKit\">GitHub - mmtk/mmtk-core: Memory Management ToolKit</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Memory Management ToolKit.

(surprising, i know.)  but that could be a starting point for testing it out, if it's of interest</p>",
