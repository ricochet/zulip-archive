You'll need to either copy data into the wasm program or otherwise have an abstract \"handle\" that the wasm program uses which the host operates on behalf of wasm. For example <code>JNIEnv</code> might be behind a handle where the guest wasm calls a function which causes the host to use the <code>JNIEnv</code> value it can access. </p>\n<p>FWIW this is all what the component model is targeted at solving -- providing abstractions for common types like resources (handles), strings, lists, etc, and all the management of that is done via bindings generation in the host and the guest</p>",

        "content": "<p>Right, you wouldn't actually carry anything like a <code>JNIEnv</code> into the guest Rust -- that type carries a lot of implications with it (actual pointer, how to use it, etc). The \"handle\" approach usually works by keeping an external (host-side) table of pointers/state, and giving indices into this table to the guest as handles. You wouldn't want to pass the raw pointer in as e.g. an <code>i64</code> because then you're trusting the guest Wasm to preserve its value, and allowing it to control raw memory accesses, which defeats the point of the sandbox</p>",
