        "content": "<p>Hello Paul, This is something we are currently trying to figure out currently at Klave. TEEs have inherent constraints (OS and host untrusted, etc.) and for good reasons. Therefore clearly all WASI interfaces would not be able to be implemented as per the ABI. I suppose naive implementation could be done for TEEs (forwarding call to host for instance) but would come at a great price in terms of security. I believe the approach that should be taken is to pick and choose WASI interface that would make sense to implement in the TEEs (Crypto for instance, etc.) and for the rest leverage on the component model to allow specific sets of APIs to be described and implemented to meet the need of the TEEs. You can find previous thoughts on that topic here <a href=\"https://blog.enarx.dev/language-support-for-wasi-2/\">https://blog.enarx.dev/language-support-for-wasi-2/</a> and if you want to know more about how we are currently tackling that at klave, here: <a href=\"https://klave.com/\">https://klave.com/</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://blog.enarx.dev/language-support-for-wasi-2/\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/4985fd82d68ae4f780e8de994ef1d7323c8568a2\\/68747470733a2f2f626c6f672e656e6172782e6465762f636f6e74656e742f696d616765732f323032322f31312f7761736d2d6c616e67732d312e706e67)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://blog.enarx.dev/language-support-for-wasi-2/\" title=\"WASI language support (part 2)\">WASI language support (part 2)</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">In the previous blog post, we analysed the popularity/desirability of various programming languages for WebAssembly/WASI among wasmtime users. The Enarx project uses wasmtime as a runtime and, in principle, if an application works on wasmtime, then it should work equally well on Enarx.\n\nGood support for WebAssembly/WASI</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://klave.com/\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/02cb867b8e511cf30b73406fbc53e613da85353d\\/68747470733a2f2f6b6c6176652e636f6d2f696d616765732f6f70656e67726170682d696d6167652e706e67)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://klave.com/\" title=\"Klave.
