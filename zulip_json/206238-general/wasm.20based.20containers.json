There have been forays into implementing something like a containerd shim on top of a wasm runtime, but i haven't seen anything active in that space lately.  I think the biggest project to supplant containers in favor of wasm is Krustlet (<a href=\"https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet\">https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet</a>) that attempts to reimplement k8s' kubelet in terms of a wasm runtime rather than a container runtime.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet\" style=\"background-image: url(https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/226983227/888d3900-2b1b-11eb-9eae-faa62e3fac25)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet\" title=\"deislabs/krustlet\">deislabs/krustlet</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Kubernetes Rust Kubelet.
