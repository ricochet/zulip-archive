        "content": "<p>Our usecase is that we create a web server (long-running worker) which creates an engine once and then uses tokio library to run incoming serverless tasks as modules in the same engine. Worker is a process, and we use wasmtime embedding API for creating one engine which is used to run all modules. We have few alternatives:<br>\n1) We add a support for profiling individual modules in a engine within wasmtime.<br>\n2) Create two engines in one worker and use second engine for profiling purpose.<br>\n3) We can create a dedicate pool of workers for profiling and gateway will intercept request with profiling and submit to those dedicated workers.</p>\n<p>I wanted to get feedback which alternative is better? Secondly, even if we go with option 2 or 3, jitdump works on a process level so within an engine if we profile all modules, only one jitdump file will be created, so how should we workaround this to get separate jitdump file for each module?</p>",
