One exports a function \"f\" that the other imports.  Using wat2wasm with --relocatable followed by wasm-ld-11 gives the error <code>wasm-ld-11: error: a.wasm: Out of order section type: 0</code>    This gist <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bcdroid/57c5cf048c585d60894b2e91c5b7119a\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/bcdroid/57c5cf048c585d60894b2e91c5b7119a\">https://gist.github.com/bcdroid/57c5cf048c585d60894b2e91c5b7119a</a> contains the wat files and commands I used.  Is this kind of static linking intended?  Do I need to create a custom section in the wasm files to control static linking?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://gist.github.com/bcdroid/57c5cf048c585d60894b2e91c5b7119a\" style=\"background-image: url(https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/gists/gist-og-image.png)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bcdroid/57c5cf048c585d60894b2e91c5b7119a\" title=\"a.wat\">a.wat</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">GitHub Gist: instantly share code, notes, and snippets.</div></div></div>",
