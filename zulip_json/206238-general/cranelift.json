I hope this is the right place to ask.<br>\nI want to do something like  this and call this from cranelift:<br>\npub extern \"C\" fn to_jitval(ptr: *mut Parameter) -&gt; (i64, i64) {<br>\n    let r = unsafe {Box::from_raw(ptr)};<br>\n    (r.value, r.value_type)<br>\n}<br>\nThis works, I successfully receive multiple return values when it is called from cranlift jit.<br>\nBut I think this return type (tuple) is unstable usage of ABI. Is it unsafe to do this? How can I return multiple values from a function?</p>",
