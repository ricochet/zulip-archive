The game engine has an ECS, which can store ECS Resources. Often times, these ECS resources can be kind of big, so I wouldn't want to marshal them to the guest. Instead I would want to create a WASM component resource. The issue I'm running into is that in the <code>get-resource</code> WIT function on the World interface, I must return a typed resource. Rust represents a resource with <code>Resource&lt;T&gt;</code>, so I must know the type when writing the function implementation.</p>\n<p>You mentioned that I could offer</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(A) way to fallibly \"downcast\" a resource to a target type or to turn it into a variant of the possible concrete types either as a method or standalone function</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm interested in how you could represent that in WIT. I'm experienced in Rust, but still relatively new to WASM and Wit. Thanks for the help!!</p>",

I do intend that the user would create a higher level api over the low level api provided through the WIT files. Right now I feel like I'm working around WIT's restrictions tbh. I felt similarly when implementing Lua though tbf.</p>\n<p>It would be great to have a wit function that directly translates to <code>World:get_resource&lt;T&gt;()</code>, but I have to expose a lower level api, then the user can create higher level wrappers that expose a similar api to what the host would have. That's actually what I'm doing with a C# package.</p>",

It's a family of functions (or a \"type constructor\") and two components could only soundly compose if they provide and use the same concrete functions. Otherwise, what happens when I call <code>get-resource&lt;U&gt;</code> for some <code>U</code> the exporting interface hasn't implemented?</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it makes a lot of sense to be able to want to write WIT generically over some types and let a given implementation fill in those types to choose its concrete type. However, this is no longer a concrete interface or world. We've taken to calling these higher-level constructs \"WIT templates\" and the parameters \"holes\" iirc.</p>\n<p>There has been some discussion and experiments around what this might look like but I believe it will be quite some time (on the scale of years) before they're high enough priority compared to other work (like preview 3 async) to get fully implemented since they're very complex.</p>",
