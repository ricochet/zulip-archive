So, if I understand you correctly, WASI <em>might</em> become <em>the</em> standard for all of WebAssembly? In other words, each platform, for example, the browser, or the PC, could implement the pieces of the WASI component model for their own runtime requirements? That makes sense, since the browser is potentially just another app running on top of WASI anyway. I'm also guessing that this will mean that browsers like Chrome and Firefox would need to be fundamentally refactored if they chooses to go this route?</p>\n<p>Anyways, was this WebAssembly's original roadmap? Or is this new \"unified\" approach a recent decision?</p>",

        "content": "<p>WASI and the component model are two different things, and browsers might implement the component model, but not any parts of WASI, or some WASI proposals that make sense in their context.</p>\n<p>One key aspect of the component model is that it's fully virtualizable: all component model APIs can be implemented in-content with other components. That means that any parts of a component-model based WASI can be polyfilled in browsers until such a time when browsers might add native support.</p>\n<p>But to get back to your initial question: as described in the rust-wasm link I shared it's possible today to use async with Wasm, but the component model has such support deeply built in</p>",
