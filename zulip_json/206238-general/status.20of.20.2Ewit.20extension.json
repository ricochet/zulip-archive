I notice that in the commit (<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types/commit/8c4cc5ee2e41d0ea06c7f3760eaa348378a46d51\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types/commit/8c4cc5ee2e41d0ea06c7f3760eaa348378a46d51\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types/commit/8c4cc5ee2e41d0ea06c7f3760eaa348378a46d51</a>) a bunch of test files in the wasm-interface-types repo were renamed from *.wit to *.wat. I couldn't find a discussion around why the change was made though. The only other documentation I see that currently mentions .wit is this (<a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-types/blob/master/proposals/module-types/Overview.md\" title=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-types/blob/master/proposals/module-types/Overview.md\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-types/blob/master/proposals/module-types/Overview.md</a>). Just wondering the status because I'm currently working on some parser tooling for webassembly text formats.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types/commit/8c4cc5ee2e41d0ea06c7f3760eaa348378a46d51\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/54038801?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types/commit/8c4cc5ee2e41d0ea06c7f3760eaa348378a46d51\" title=\"Rename files with `*.wat` extension · bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types@8c4cc5e\">Rename files with `*.wat` extension · bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types@8c4cc5e</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Don't try to co-opt the `*.wit` extension by accident.</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-types/blob/master/proposals/module-types/Overview.md\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11578470?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-types/blob/master/proposals/module-types/Overview.md\" title=\"WebAssembly/module-types\">WebAssembly/module-types</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Proposal for adding module types and their text format - WebAssembly/module-types</div></div></div>",
