I do have a somehow weird use case where having access to the store could be useful: from a signal handler I would increase the epoch. When we hit the epoch deadline, I'd like to get a backtrace. This would allow me to build a very rudimentary profiler by just using <a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/api/wasmtime/struct.WasmBacktrace.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/api/wasmtime/struct.WasmBacktrace.html</a> </p>\n<p>Would this be okay? I'm happy to make the change, but maybe it's wrong for some reason I do not understand.</p>",
