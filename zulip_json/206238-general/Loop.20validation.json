I had assumed that the conditional branch to the start of the loop would be disallowed with that i32 on the stack.  I thought I might be able to reach a stack limit by running the program with a large initial counter, but wasmtime ran it successfully.  I am still trying to decipher the spec's validation formalism.  Could anyone confirm that this program is OK, and whether the runtime optimizes away the extra i32 on the stack or something else happens?  TIA</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>(module\n (func $start (export &quot;_start&quot;) (result i32)\n   (local $counter i32)\n   (local.set $counter (i32.const 0xFFFFFFFF))\n   loop $repeat (result i32)\n     (local.get $counter)\n     (local.set $counter (i32.sub (local.get $counter) (i32.const 1)))\n     (br_if $repeat (local.get $counter))\n   end\n )\n)\n</pre></div>",
