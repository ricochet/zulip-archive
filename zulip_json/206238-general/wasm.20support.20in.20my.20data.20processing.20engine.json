        "content": "<p>Hi. I have an engine that let my users pre-process data going into a HTTP API. For example if someone <code>POST</code> an item with <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> they can write a simple snippet to concatenate this into a new <code>fullName</code> field. I use <em>deno_core</em> to run their code in a sandbox. They run in a context where <code>item</code> is a globally available variable, which they can read and write to. Something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"JavaScript\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nx\">item</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">fullName</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">item</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">firstName</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">' '</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">item</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">lastName</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This works fine, and with this I have support for both JS and TS. <br>\nBut with wasm I could in theory add support for a bunch of other languages and cool features.<br>\nI thought this would be easy, just let people send in a wasm module instead of JS and I pass in the item. But it turns out it is a bit more complicated in wasm world.<br>\nAny suggestions on how to make this as pleasant for my users as possible (the people making the modules)?<br>\nEverything I've tried so far, of wasmtime, assemblyscript, kotlin, c++ etc. is not very language agnostic, it seems there is not even an agreement on what a string should look like.<br>\nThis made me look into <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component/tree/main/example\">compoment model</a> and WIT. But I'm not sure it does what I really want.<br>\nWIT seems like what I want, but the truth is that host system doesn't actually know the item type, it just passes JSON. This made me think I could let end users bundle in JSON parser/writer in their wasm and do JSON in and out. But even that won't work if a string isn't common.<br>\nPerhaps WIT with just string in/out? And shouldn't compoment model without WIT define a string?<br>\nUsing very new features is not a problem, it is better for users to wait for proper support in their language than some home-made solution.<br>\nAny suggestions?
