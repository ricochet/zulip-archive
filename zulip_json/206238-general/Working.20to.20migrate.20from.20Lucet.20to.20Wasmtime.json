To do this, though, we'd need to incorporate a few meaty features from Lucet into Wasmtime.</p>\n<p>After discussion with the team at Fastly, I've put together a document laying out what the major issues are. We'd plan to write up RFCs (using the new <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs\">RFC process</a>!) giving more detailed proposals for each of these pieces, based on what we've done in Lucet. But meanwhile, we want to give a heads-up as to what we're thinking about, and get any very early feedback through Google doc comments.</p>\n<p>You can find the overview document <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aelDJQkKe76_6UnXqaqPBcYysSbrtnorHnn4Lr5xE_A/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a> (unfortunately I'm not able to make it world-readable, so request access if needed and I'll grant it!)</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/54038801?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs\" title=\"bytecodealliance/rfcs\">bytecodealliance/rfcs</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">RFC process for Bytecode Alliance projects.
