The library operates over VReg structures however there seems to be no way to specify a bitwidth in VReg. </p>\n<p>I want to use regalloc2 to do register allocation for me in my IR. However I can specify bitwidth of virtual registers in my IR and i want to convey that to regalloc2. </p>\n<p>How can regalloc2 do register allocation on different sized registers...?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.rs/regalloc2/0.9.3/regalloc2/struct.VReg.html\">https://docs.rs/regalloc2/0.9.3/regalloc2/struct.VReg.html</a></p>\n<p>^ docs for VReg</p>",
