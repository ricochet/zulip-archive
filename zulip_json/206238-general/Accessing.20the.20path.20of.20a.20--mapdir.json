I can open the files fine on the client side using fs:read(\"mapdir_name\"). But when I want to read those files on the Host side, I'm not clear on how to do this. More plainly, I have a web assembly example I'm running using --mapdir to specify where my files are located. I want the app to pass that mapped folder name to wasi-nn and be able to open the files on the wasi-nn side. Is this currently doable, and if so what is the best way to accomplish this? Thanks.</p>",
