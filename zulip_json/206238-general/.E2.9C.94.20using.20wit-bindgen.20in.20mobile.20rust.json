        "content": "<p>Hello, the readme said to reach out, so we're doing that. Briefly, we're looking to use Rust written WASM, interpreted in Rust runtime via something like <code>wasm3</code> or <code>wasmtime</code>. That's why we're looking to potentially depend on <code>wit-bindgen</code>. First of all, does this make sense? Secondly, what would be the community's suggestion on the interface? (if any) we're thinking of passing a <code>vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> to/from WASM like so:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">handle</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span>: <span class=\"nc\">vec</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"nc\">vec</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"c1\">// 1. parse, 2. do work, 3. return bin repre</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Some loose requirements/expectations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>both ends should know the alignment to parse the input/output of the handle function</li>\n<li>we will use the <code>vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> parser/printer in mobile context, with other languages (Kotlin/Swift), not just Rust</li>\n<li>we'd like to share Rust entities and use them in both host (rust) and guest (rust) runtime</li>\n<li>the Rust runtime itself will be relatively hollow, most of the logic should reside in Rust-written-WASM</li>\n</ol>\n<p>given the above, what resources/tech do you recommend? is wit-bindgen a good fit? it looks like the solution to us b/c interface types are not maintained now, and quite heavy (i.e. wasm-bindgen assumes a lot of JS type inter-op that we don't need). we want something fast, with small binary size, and ideally future proof (not another abandoned experiment).</p>\n<p>if something is too vague pls lmk and i can clarify</p>",
