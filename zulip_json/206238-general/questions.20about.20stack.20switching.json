Is it possible for a module to pause/yield its own execution, have its Store be written, and then have the host restart it from the point where it was in execution? The goal is just to enable async/await semantics from inside modules.</p>\n<p>Apologies if this is the wrong place to post--just feeling my way around Zulip today.</p>",
