I've managed to dig my way to something that works for the guest (my plugin) to call host functions that give and take strings, and the host can call guest functions that take no arguments, but I'm getting a \"cannot reenter component instance\" error when trying to call guest functions that take arguments from the host.<br>\nI suspect this is a case of mismatched tooling support, since i'm using wasmtime <code>main</code> to get <code>wasmtime::component::generate!</code> for my host but using the latest wasm-tools from <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> and wit-bindgen-guest-rust <code>main</code> for my guest. But there's also a large chance i'm just doing something wrong.
