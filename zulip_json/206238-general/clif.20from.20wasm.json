However, is there a way to view the IR that cranelift generates while compiling down a full <code>.wasm</code> file? For example, if I have a program, <code>test.c</code> that I compile to <code>test.wasm</code> with WASI sdk, can I intercept the IR generated when running with <code>wasmtime test.wasm</code> etc? Or, is there a way / tool to take the <code>test.wasm</code> file and get to the cranelift IR that cranelift would use?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
