I tried to build wasmtime from source with lightbeam enabled with the following command:<br>\n   cargo build --release --features lightbeam<br>\nI then tried to invoke the lightbeam compiler:<br>\n   ./wasmtime --lightbeam ~/coremark-wasi.wasm</p>\n<p>However, I get a panic at crates/lightbeam/wasmtime/src/lib.rs:224. It seems like this function is newly added, so I tried to checkout and build a few older versions of wasmtime. But it still doesn't work: I just get panics at different places. </p>\n<p>Can anyone offer me help on testing the performance of the Lightbeam compiler? Thanks!</p>",

Its main author (Vurich) has not contributed for about a year by now so I also would not expect a lot of momentum for it. Technically the backend can be compared with the Wasmer singlepass backend.</p>",
