For some context, here are some gists with C, Rust and desired WAT sources: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/kubkon/56ee4359fceeef469c9c0e58bf648292\">https://gist.github.com/kubkon/56ee4359fceeef469c9c0e58bf648292</a>. Both Rust and C which AFAIK utilise <code>wasm-ld</code> behind the scenes don't seem to play ball here with me. I wanted to double check here before asking/submitting a potential bug in upstream LLVM.
