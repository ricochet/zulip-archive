I'm looking for functionality similar to <code>fork</code> or thread creation as seen in traditional operating systems. Specifically, I'm interested in:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thread Creation</strong>: How can I create and manage threads within a Wasmtime instance? Is there a standard API or library that provides threading support?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Concurrency</strong>: What are the best practices for handling concurrent execution in Wasmtime? Are there any examples or documentation on how to implement concurrency effectively?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shared State</strong>: How can I share state between threads? Are there any built-in mechanisms or patterns recommended for shared memory or message passing between threads in Wasmtime?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Synchronization</strong>: What synchronization primitives are available (e.g., mutexes, semaphores) for managing access to shared resources?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any guidance, examples, or references to relevant documentation would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",
