        "content": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>I have been looking into WebAssembly, the new component model and  WIT this week for the first time. It's all a little bit overwhelming, and I am always trying to figure out how all the things work together.</p>\n<p>Today I had a look into the brand new <a href=\"https://github.com/sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http\">hello-wasi-http</a>. Works fine, concept is clear. But what I found a little bit annoying when trying to figure things out, understanding the used types,  is the code generation. As I always value feedbacks from newbies in my projects, I thought I just share my view.</p>\n<p>The magic <code>cargo_component_bindings::generate!()</code> macro generates the code from the wit files (here the wasi http types). I can expand the macro and see the code, but rust analyzer support is limited. If I want to go to the definition of let's say the <code>IncomingRequest</code>, I just jump to the line with the macro. There is as far as I know no possiblitiy to jump to e.g. the generated type. So I keep searching manually in the expanded macro code for the things I am interested in.</p>\n<p>I can still rely on code suggestions to see what the types offer for methods and fields, which is all nice and fine. But all generated code is missing documentation. The wit files are currently only using the <code>//</code> comments, but even if I add <a href=\"https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#documentation\">documentation</a> to the wit file using <code>///</code>, the macro generation seems not to use them to generate documentation style comments  on the generated code.</p>\n<p>The alternative for code generation using a proc-macro would be to generate the code up front with a <code>build.rs</code>. For the  usecase \"generation rust code from some wit files\", I would have opted for this solution, as it makes the developer experience IMHO a little bit nicer. Idealy with a lot of documentation being taken over from the wit file. </p>\n<p>For the standardized wasi interfaces I wonder if it also makes sense to offer e.g. for wasi-http a crate which contains the rust-code generated from the wit files. Currently, the hello-wasi-http project has a dependency to cargo-component-bindings only to be able to generate the rust code from wit. It a crate with this code would exist, the need for code generation would cease to exist. </p>\n<p>Are there any plans of going into this direction?</p>\n<p>Anyway: Thanks for the great work, I am looking forward to see  WebAssembly and wasmtime evolving in the future!</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/25cf3f5dc74dad0ecc920e15118ffac7e947b7c2\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f323064353630663738666233303064386532656633353435303134396230373065313763373135656231623336666563383332323737333934323137393038652f73756e66697368636f64652f68656c6c6f2d776173692d68747470)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http\" title=\"GitHub - sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http\">GitHub - sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Contribute to sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http development by creating an account on GitHub.</div></div></div>",
