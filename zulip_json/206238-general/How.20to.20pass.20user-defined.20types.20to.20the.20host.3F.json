However  it looks like this trait cannot be defined outside of the core <code>wasmtime</code> crate because that trait's method signatures use <code>StoreOpaque</code> which is not an exported type.</p>\n<p>Another way would be to convert <code>MyType</code> to a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> or  less conveniently a<code>[u8; MYTYPE_SIZE]</code>. However again neither <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> nor <code>[u8]</code> implement <code>WasmTy</code>.</p>\n<p>The last way is using <code>ExternRef</code>, which seems like the way things are \"meant\" to be done for passing opaque data that the runtime would then validate and cast into the appropriate type. However the docs aren't clear about the best practices for producing <code>ExternRef</code> in the WASM module and consuming it from the host, so I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding how this should be used.</p>",

To access a value in the module's memory segment, I would allocate that value in the module and pass a pointer to runtime via an <code>extern fn</code> called by the module. The runtime would then access the value by adding the pointer to the offset of the module's memory in the runtime's memory.</p>\n<p>For passing a value to the module, the runtime doesn't know about the module's allocator. Therefore the module needs to allocate memory for the value, pass a pointer to the runtime as above, and have the runtime put that value in the module's memory, again using the start of the module's memory + pointer.</p>\n<p>Am I thinking about this at too low of a level?
