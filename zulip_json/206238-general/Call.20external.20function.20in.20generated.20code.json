I am wondering how to call an external function (say <code>sin</code> from libmath) from the generated code when emitting <code>.o</code> files with <code>cranelift-object</code>. Is it as simple as declaring a function with <code>module.declare_function(\"sin\", Linkdage::Import, proper_signature)</code> and then the linker would be able to link correctly?</p>",
