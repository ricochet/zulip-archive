For networking tasks, this is a really good solution because each of these tasks is run on a separated so-called process that has its own heap &amp; stack (this is not a system process though). The concurrency is therefore really safe and fast. If you have two processes (tasks) that are dependent, then you can pass async messages between them and also define what happens if one of the processes got killed.  This is a very short description of what Lunatic does under the hood, is nothing new, but rather an implementation of Erlang OTP ideas into the world of WASM.  And if you look at why OTP was invented, then you'll understand that when you need high concurrency, OTP might be one of the best concurrency models out there.</p>",
