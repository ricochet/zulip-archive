I notice as well that you're enabling tail-call and if <code>ack</code> stands for \"ackermann\" then it's known that tail-call historically has had a perf hit with function calls in wasmtime (even non-tail-call ones). That was fixed recently (I believe at least) so recent versions of wasmtime should perform better. Locally with what I think was a development build I saw only very small differences between v8 and wasmtime. </p>\n<p>Do you know what version of wasmtime-py you're using?</p>\n<p>Also, I'll note that with the <code>--preload</code> argument you can get <code>write_{int,char}</code> working with the <code>wasmtime</code> CLI, although you're only able to invoke one function so you can't implement the driver script you've got as part of the wasmtime CLI.</p>\n<p>And finally, are there other benchmarks you're particularly interested in? For example is there another one that you see a large discrepancy on for wasmtime and v8?</p>",
