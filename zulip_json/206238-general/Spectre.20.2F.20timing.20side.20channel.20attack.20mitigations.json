However this can be circunvented if malicious code can communicate without delay to a backround thread dedicated to keeping track of the time.</p>\n<p>Blocking shared data from being read for some time after it is updated could be used to prevent that, however that could cost performance ?<br>\nMany functional languages share almost exclusively ( or exclusively ) inmutable data.  I am wondering whether wasm could take advantage of that : Different threads could pass each other inmutable references, and only the message that sends the reference would have to be delayed, memory regions or inner objects would not need to be individually locked</p>",

The bounds-checking may be explicit or not, but doing anything more than a cmp-and-branch (or Spectre-mitigation cmove) is going to be too costly to be practical. There isn't a place to put logic like \"hide shared memory updates for some time\" because loads and stores go directly to hardware; only the MMU is in that path, and updates to MMU mappings (aka TLB shootdowns) are relatively very slow.</p>\n<p>Said more bluntly: if the cost of mitigation is a 10x or more penalty in execution speed, why do multithreading at all (unless one has &gt;&gt;10 cores willing to burn)?</p>",
