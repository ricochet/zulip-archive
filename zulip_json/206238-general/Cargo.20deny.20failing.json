I'm creating a PR for the wasi-nn crate which updates the Cargo.toml to include the tensorflow rust binding crate. So basically I'm adding `tensorflow = \"0.17.0\" to the wasi-nn/Cargo.toml. However, this causes the Run cargo deny check bans licenses test to fail because it adds several duplicate lock entries.  Anyone know how I can prevent the sub crates tensorflow uses from pulling in older versions of crates Wasmtime allready is using?</p>",
