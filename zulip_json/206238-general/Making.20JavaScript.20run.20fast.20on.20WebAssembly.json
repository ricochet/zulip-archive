However there is some thinking in how to go further; there's actually a good amount that one can do ahead-of-time, i.e. without type information, if one has reasonable primitives for handling dynamism (specifically, something like ICs) at runtime. E.g. one could in theory translate JS bytecode to Wasm bytecode that is mostly IC-chain invocations. One could imagine further optimizations from there. Anyway, doing even better here is something I've spent a lot of time thinking about and hopefully at some point we'll have something more :-)</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"268444\">@Julian Seward</span> yes, funnily enough, I actually drafted a (very rough) idea for such a feature a few months ago! We discussed some internally, and it didn't go too far (it was suggested that in theory, function refs + GC structs + tail calls + the right optimizations could cause the same thing to fall out), but maybe I'll see if I can socialize the ideas a bit more to see if there is any interest.</p>\n<p>The basic idea was to define a particular kind of function that is a \"stub\", and to define a new kind of global that can carry a chain of stubs with attached data (as parameters). So basically the runtime is aware of IC chains; making it a first-class Wasm concept could allow for other tools to do interesting things, e.g. inline some IC stubs after freezing (Wizer-style) execution. We would have opcodes to invoke an IC chain, prepend a new stub to a chain, and clear a chain. Every chain would always have a normal-function fallback. I was careful to define conditions so that the engine could (i) do all this without dynamic allocation, (ii) codegen the stubs in a way that would allow for \"naked\" function bodies, with no frames or stack checks, etc., just as IC stubs work in native engines today.</p>\n<p>All of this relies on the fact that the AOT-vs-JIT dimension is orthogonal to the IC-chain kind of dynamism; we can know all of our stub bodies ahead of time and include them in our .wasm, so none of this is a \"JIT\". That said, if we eventually freeze execution and inspect the chains, we <em>could</em> inline some stubs and further optimize, and then we might start to see this as a JIT -- it's kind of like Warp (SM's new JS tier) in its approach.</p>\n<p>I like the idea of a first-class IC-chains feature in particular because it's more \"Wasm-like\" than special optimizations that rely on particular combinations of features used in a certain way -- it avoids performance cliffs and just expresses a concept directly so no reverse-engineering is necessary.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if there's interest in that, I can see about dusting things off and sharing :-)</p>",

The experiment convinced me that we'd probably need a lower-cost form of control flow to make ICs work well; either a first-class Wasm feature for ICs (I had a draft writeup of something for this at one point but never shared it publicly) or use of e.g. tail calls plus funcrefs and some wasm engine opts to remove as much of the function call overhead as possible</p>",
