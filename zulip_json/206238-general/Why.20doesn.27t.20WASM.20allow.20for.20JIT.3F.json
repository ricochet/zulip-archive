But!</p>\n<p>The point of import and export control across the native host is a real one, but of course we can also protect the host with other means. Hosts <em>always</em> must be secured -- obviously in any compute the initiating process must be trusted and protected. That goes without saying. The typical scenario for wasm is protection <em>for the host and other modules</em> and not from within the module -- the assumption is that this is something you produced, so you control it. And the imports and exports should be tightly created and strongly typed -- no \"here's a byte[] for fun\". </p>\n<p>So to your question about submodules: in reality, you CAN do dynamically created code, if you're strongly motivated. :-) <a href=\"https://wingolog.org/archives/2022/08/18/just-in-time-code-generation-within-webassembly\">https://wingolog.org/archives/2022/08/18/just-in-time-code-generation-within-webassembly</a> is one approach. :-)</p>",

There are ways to do AOT compilation of dynamic languages.</p>\n<p>One important key insight is that we can contain all the dynamism of types and resulting behavior dispatch in ICs / inline-caches, and we can compile those ahead-of-time, putting the runtime choice in just an indirect call, for example. This gets us to a \"baseline compiler\" (in SpiderMonkey terms) level.</p>\n<p>In general I think there is a deeply embedded implicit assumption in a lot of folks' thinking here that we must have an online compiler (JIT) but IMHO we just need to think a bit harder about the phasing separation (compile time vs. run time) and rearchitect things a bit.</p>",

For example with \"short-lived instances\", where a Wasm module is instantiated to perform one function execution (HTTP request, custom database function, ...), we really don't have a chance to \"warm up\", even if we did have a JIT primitive. In such cases, we need the toolchain to decide ahead of time; and maybe we can have a slower feedback loop (PGO-style rebuild after observation/profiling). Note again in my talk above I discuss this and outline how once we do ICs with indirect calls for pure AOT, we can do PGO-guided inlining alone (and no language-specific code!) to get much of the way toward a type-optimizing compiler</p>",
