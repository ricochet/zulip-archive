As <a href=\"https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/1-year-update#the-lucet-and-wasmtime-teams-join-forces\">announced in Monday's 1-year update on the Bytecode Alliance</a>, most of the Wasmtime team moved over to Fastly. That's what I was alluding to in expressing confidence about the resourcing, but I wasn't able to talk about it yet. The article includes a few more details about what all this means for our team and for Mozilla, so I highly recommend reading it.
