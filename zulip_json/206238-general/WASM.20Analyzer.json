It allows you to inspect wasm files by uploading them (it's only client side so no wasm files are ever stored or sent to a server) or by exploring and inspecting components on the WARG registry: <a href=\"https://wa2.dev/\">https://wa2.dev/</a></p>\n<p>Give it a try and share any feedback you might have. We are working on publishing it open-source in the coming days.<br>\nDocumentation will soon be published as well.</p>",
