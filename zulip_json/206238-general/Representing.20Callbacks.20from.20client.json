I'm using the component model to define API functions and figuring out a way so that client applications can pass a callback to host functions, which the host can store the callback somewhere and invoke the callback when an event is triggered, which can be after the host function call returns. I am considering two approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using an address (function pointer) as the handle to the callback function: I tried to define the interface like:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">world</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">api</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"c1\">// might not be the correct syntax</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"k\">type</span> <span class=\"nc\">listener</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">import</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">register</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">listener</span>: <span class=\"nc\">func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">listener</span>: <span class=\"nc\">listener</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">export</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">call</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">listener</span>: <span class=\"nc\">func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">listener</span>: <span class=\"nc\">listener</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">arg</span>: <span class=\"nc\">string</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">export</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">drop</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">listener</span>: <span class=\"nc\">func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">listener</span>: <span class=\"nc\">listener</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>And the client will implement it like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\">// export this as call-listener</span>\n<span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">call_listener</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">listener</span>: <span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">arg</span>: <span class=\"nb\">String</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">listener</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">as</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">Fn</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">String</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">arg</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>What is not clear to me is that:</p>\n<p>1. How will function pointers be converted to integer in WASM? I think it will just be the offset of WASM's linear address. If this is the case, because all WASM instance has their own linear address, to specify a function I'll need a pair of instance ID and address, is that correct? In short, do I also need the instance ID to uniquely determine a client callback?<br>\n  2. If the answer to 1. is yes, then I'll need to figure out a way to get the instance that is calling the host function. How do I do it with component model? For \"vanilla\" WASM without component model in wasmtime, the function given to <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Func.html#method.wrap\"><code>wrap</code></a> can take an extra <code>Caller</code> argument, but it does not seems to give information about the calling instance. Not to mention that if I use the component model, I can only implement the member functions in the trait generated by bindgen, which does not include the <code>Caller</code> argument.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using resource: Resource is not fully implemented so I guess I'll have to wait a bit. And I don't think I have a clear picture how it will work. I imagine that in this case the host will defined the resource type in WIT:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">world</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">api</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"c1\">// might not be the correct syntax</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">import</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">register</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">listener</span>: <span class=\"nc\">func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">listener</span>: <span class=\"nc\">listener</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">export</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">resource</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">listener</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">call</span>: <span class=\"nc\">func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">arg</span>: <span class=\"nc\">string</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>And the client can then expose a type, say a wrapper of <code>Rc&lt;dyn FnMut(String)&gt;</code>, as the type of the callback. Some questions:</p>\n<p>1. Similarly, do I need the instance ID that owns the callback function to correctly resolve it? If wasmtime can convert the resource type <code>listener</code> into some typed-handle that I call just do <code>listener.call(42)</code> I won't need to know which instance is calling the <code>register-listener</code> function, but if not I still need to known which instance does this callback belong to and manually pass the correct function implemented by the module.</p>",

This then needs to be stored on the host, and a when a new file is created, the host needs to call all the listeners <em>in their respective instances</em>.</p>\n<p>So it's kind of important to know which instance registered which listener. You could of course, as I already mention, save the current instance id before every exported function call in the store's data, and then read that instance id in the imported function.
