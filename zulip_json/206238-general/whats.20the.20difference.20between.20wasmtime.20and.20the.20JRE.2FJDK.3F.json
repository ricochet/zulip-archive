        "content": "<p>in addition to linear memory vs. GC object model, there are significant differences in the complexity of the underlying VM. The JVM has a class loader mechanism, virtual method dispatch, interfaces, and all of that baked into the VM; the idea was to build a VM close to the semantic level of the source language. Wasm on the other hand has memory load/store and indirect call, and expects the guest to build everything from those; the idea was to build a VM close to the semantic level of machine code. (The one key departure is in first-class functions / a \"protected stack\", as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"254083\">@Dan Gohman</span> likes to say, which has a bunch of implications for things like coroutines and exceptions.) The key corollaries from that are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It's easier to build and secure an implementation of a low-level VM than a high-level VM. We see this in the fact that there are many independent Wasm implementations (and a motivated person can write a basic interpreter for Wasm in maybe a few days), but historically only a few practical JVMs, and really basically one today (OpenJDK). And, as others touched on above, Wasm's sandboxing has become a relatively validated trust boundary, used in practice in browsers and other untrusted-code scenarios (like function-as-a-service server-side code or like plugin systems), whereas no one relies on JVM-based security; the JVM is always stuffed in a container or machine VM.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It's a much more universal compilation target. Because it has one linear address space, it works perfectly fine without any tricks for C/C++/Rust/Zig/...; any systems language works just fine. First-class functions also give the Wasm environment a nailed-down C ABI, so interop between these systems languages is pretty easy. As others noted above, one can emulate a single address space on the JVM but aside from the emulation overhead, it will be very difficult to FFI to JVM-native languages in that design.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
