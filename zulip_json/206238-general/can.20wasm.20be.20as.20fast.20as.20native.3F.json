LPython has the following guarantee / contract: if your Python code compiles in LPython and runs in Debug mode without any runtime errors (such as bounds checking), then we guarantee that exactly the same code on exactly the same input also runs in CPython and produces the same answer (as well as when recompiled with LPython in ReleaseFast mode).

Take our existing fast WASM-&gt;x64 (x86_64) backend. We guarantee the following (assuming no bugs in our compiler, which currently is not satisfied): if a given LFortran's code compiles and runs in Debug mode via our WASM-&gt;x64 backend and produces the right answer without any runtime errors, then the same <code>a.wasm</code> should run in wasmtime and produce the same answer (as well as running in the browser!), as well as in our WASM-&gt;x64 backend in ReleaseFast mode.

Even a subset of Wasm -- say, Wasm modules that would not have trapped in the original execution -- <em>require</em> the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Wasm abstraction for memory is a 32-bit (for now) region and Wasm pointers are offsets into the region. The fastest way we know how to compile this is to have a 4GB+guard area of virtual memory in the host process, and compile all Wasm memory accesses to <code>heap_base + offset</code>. That <code>heap_base</code> needs to live in a register, and the extra addition makes addressing modes a little more expensive (e.g. if the original program could do <code>[base + index*4]</code> on x86, we have to compute <code>tmp = base + index*4</code> then do <code>[heap_base + tmp]</code>.)</p>\n<p>Note here that the slowdown is related to the semantics, not to the checks. We could make the region much smaller, and put unrelated data within easy reach of <code>heap_base</code> with no bounds-checks at all; and we still have the slowdown, because it comes from the \"hidden heap base\" semantics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Wasm abstraction for indirect control flow is a <code>br_table</code> instruction that has a list of target blocks, and a \"default\" that we branch to if the given index is out-of-bounds. You might say: avoid the bounds-check, and never branch to the default. Except that that is not a never-expected-to-happen-in-safe-executions behavior: it's a builtin feature of the instruction, just like a <code>default:</code> label in a C switch statement, and is used all the time.</p>\n<p>If you implement <code>br_table</code> in a way that executes ordinary (safe, non-trapping) Wasm programs correctly, you <em>have to</em> implement a compare-and-use-default-if-over-limit behavior. And once you have that, you have the bounds-check.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what I'm trying to say is: there is <em>no actual way</em> to turn off bounds checks, because the result wouldn't be Wasm. I don't mean that in a philosophical \"it wouldn't have the guarantees we like to talk about\" way, I mean that in a \"it wouldn't run your program correctly because it wouldn't implement the same instruction set\" way.

Consequently, these might impose some (slight) limitations on the maximum performance for \"ReleaseFast\" mode (fastest runtime, no checks), and so WASM might not be the best fit there. On the other hand, for ReleaseSafe (fast runtime and checks) this might be a perfect fit, using wasmtime for example.
