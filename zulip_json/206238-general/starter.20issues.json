I've been getting really into language programming in general - mainly from reading \"Crafting an Interpreter\" and following rust-analyzer's development (+ making a very small contribution!). I'd love to help the development of the project and learn at the same time. Don't really get many opportunities for this kind of cool stuff at my day job <span aria-label=\"big smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"big smile\">:big_smile:</span></p>",
