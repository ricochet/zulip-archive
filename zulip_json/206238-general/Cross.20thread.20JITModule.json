This requires me to hold onto JITModule in my type so that I'm able to call free_memory in the Drop impl when everything is done. From what I can tell it shouldn't be a problem to make this type compatible with such a use-case.</p>\n<p>A few fields such as <code>libcall_names: Box&lt;dyn Fn(ir::LibCall) -&gt; String&gt;</code> are <code>!Send</code>, which is stopping this type from being used in this way, but it should be able to be easily added.</p>\n<p>I'm also fine with a different way that allows me to free the memory, even if it doesn't involve holding onto JITModule. All I need is to free memory without being restricted to the same thread. I don't care that much how it's done as long as it works.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts on this?</p>",
