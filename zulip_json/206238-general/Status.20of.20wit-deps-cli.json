It would serve a short term need for my team to avoid manually managing <code>wasi:*</code> wit dependencies until <code>cargo-component</code> is further along (and the licensing headaches that might come with vendoring those wit files). But it seems infrequently updated and downloaded. Is it a reasonable tool to use or is it likely slated for deprecation?</p>",
