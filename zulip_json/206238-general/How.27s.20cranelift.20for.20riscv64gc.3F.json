We have pretty good confidence in the portions that are exercised by Wasmtime (with caveats; I believe there's no SIMD support for example). I wouldn't draw any conclusions about using it on bare metal from that. Your best bet may be to try it and see! Note that there's no support for inline assembly in Cranelift, so if you need any privileged instructions, or stack switching, you'll have to wrap those in separate functions and call them from your Cranelift-generated code.</p>",
