It seems like Wasmtime mostly targets server OSes like Linux and Windows? Is this the focus for now? Is iOS not going to be a target for the Wasmtime runtime until/unless Apple joins the Bytecode Alliance? Or, is Wasmtime only going to be a runtime for any OS only after the WASI standard is official?</p>",

I found these links about the \"Hardened Runtime capability\" of iOS. I'm not sure how this relates to Wasmtime exactly, but I thought it would be interesting to post it anyway:<br>\n<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/porting-just-in-time-compilers-to-apple-silicon\">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/porting-just-in-time-compilers-to-apple-silicon</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime\">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime</a></p>",

It's for \"server-side\" applications, but I want to use the same App for server-side and client-side. \"Server-side\" would be a node that's always online (never logs out). I would guess that in many App use cases, a JIT would not be a requirement as the App would be precompiled? Also, saying that Wasmtime runs everywhere would be good marketing ;) I know Wasmer claims to compile to iOS... Maybe they use some sort of hack or run their own JIT library.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"http://lunatic.solutions\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/a6fda02c1f2c2d43fd9a5a9846c8ea93f66eaaf2\\/68747470733a2f2f6c756e617469632e736f6c7574696f6e732f7374617469632f6c756e617469632d6c6f676f2d31353266366131363334663763643264333035613066343264643137323435352e706e67)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"http://lunatic.solutions\" title=\"Lunatic - An Erlang-inspired runtime for WebAssembly\">Lunatic - An Erlang-inspired runtime for WebAssembly</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Lunatic is an open-source WebAssembly runtime and platform for running server-side applications</div></div></div>",
