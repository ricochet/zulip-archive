But now to run the wasmtime tests, I need a wasm32-unknown-unknown target built and to build with cargo-component, I need a wasm32-wasi target built. How do I do that from the rustc source?

By anything else? I assume it is crucial they are built for the architecture, hardware and OS and LLVM version, where the llvm portion of rustc will be running.</p>\n<p>On a platform like OpenBSD that is Tier 3, but is a little odd because their changing libraries and ABI mean cross compiling to OpenBSD isn't really a thing, and there are a few patches applied to the rustc source before calling x.py, and there is a distribution of rustc and cargo that is three versions old now (1.76.0), and rustc usually (or always?) require bootstrapping with the immediately previous version of the compiler, it gets complicated. There is a maintained shell script for building beta on OpenBSD, but I had to invoke it multiple times to get from 1.76 to 1.79. And the script patches build files and creates its own config.toml without using the configure script.</p>\n<p>But the build shell script that builds the config.toml doesn't allow for additional targets like wasm32-unknown-unknown and wasm32-wasi to be built. So I'm still trying different incarnations of the script or from building from stable source, applying the same patches, and my own versions of a config.toml that are a combination of what was used to compile the beta on OpenBSD with what is created when running ./configure with arguments as shown in the wasi-sockets-tests instructions that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"509936\">@Joel Dice</span> provided above.</p>\n<p>I don't know if I should be able to reuse the source and build directories that created the latest rustc beta to build just the two wasm targets if I use a new config.toml and run x.py again or is it designed to only build all necessary targets at once. I think I tried building just the wasm targets before and ran into some stage0 config or json issue but I can try that again too after my current attempt at a combination build fails.</p>",
