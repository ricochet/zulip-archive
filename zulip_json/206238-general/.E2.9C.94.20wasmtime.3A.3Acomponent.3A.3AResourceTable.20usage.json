Using <code>push&lt;MyResource&gt;</code> on the table would get a <code>Resource&lt;MyResource&gt;</code> that only stores that zero sized enum.  I'm then left with manging a seperate table of resources to store the actual implementation.</p>\n<p>Assuming the resource actually needs a state, should I not be letting bindgen generate the resource type for me or am I overlooking something?</p>",
