It also means that you can't see the list of suggested reviewers.</p>\n<p>Is it fine to just open a PR without any reviewer and wait for someone to take a look at it? That seems better than pinging someone semi-randomly in the comments.</p>",

And yes, at least a few of us monitor the stream of PRs that come in, and someone should pick it up even if it doesn't have a reviewer requested. I'm not sure about the permissions issues / ability to request reviews; we should at least take a look at that policy and consider whether it makes sense. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"234973\">@Till Schneidereit</span> might have more thoughts on this?</p>",
