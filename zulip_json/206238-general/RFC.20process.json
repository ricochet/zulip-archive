I just added a <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/1#issuecomment-731168377\">comment to the pull request</a> introducing that process (by using the process itself <span aria-label=\"stuck out tongue\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f61b\" role=\"img\" title=\"stuck out tongue\">:stuck_out_tongue:</span>). That comment kicks off the steps required to get the RFC merged, and thus instate the RFC process itself for the BA.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to chime in on the PR if you have any concerns! To set expectations, I'll note that we might not be able to address any and all concerns people might have, and intend to merge the PR once the requirements as described in the RFC itself are met. But I'd very much expect that if relevant issues are surfaced, key stakeholders would support addressing those, and holding up acceptance of the RFC until that has happened.</p>\n<p>(Sincere apologies for the @\\all mention! I thought long and hard about whether it's justified quite a bit, and came to the conclusion that yes, this is one of the rare situations where it is!)</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/aturon/ba-rfcs/blob/rfc-process/accepted/rfc-process.md\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/709807?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/aturon/ba-rfcs/blob/rfc-process/accepted/rfc-process.md\" title=\"aturon/ba-rfcs\">aturon/ba-rfcs</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">RFC process for Bytecode Alliance projects.
