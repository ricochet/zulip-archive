We all would like zero bugs here, but if your use-case has a special dependence on it today, perhaps it would make sense to build a fuzz target that (for example) looks for non-canonical NaN values at any observable point, and contribute that to the project. It might also be worth getting in touch with the person who filed the recent NaN-canonicalization-related bugs to see if there's a way to support their work</p>",
