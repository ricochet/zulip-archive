Thanks for sharing the links! It was on our long term wishlist to make it run in the browser too, so it's awesome to see you're already doing the work. It would be interesting to see if we could rebase on wasm-bridge, but would have to check if there are any other non-web dependencies that would need to be adapted as well.</p>\n<p>We'd like to focus on fleshing out the Portal API and app first though, before we consider \"web embed\" (really bringing back the Flash era now...)</p>",

The CLI also has a dynamic linking mode where you can create a very small WebAssembly module that links against a provider module containing the QuickJS interpreter compiled to Wasm.</p>\n<p>There are a few library crates that are part of Javy that are published to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> for building your own WebAssembly modules that can use the QuickJS interpreter to execute JavaScript source code and adding support for some JavaScript APIs to Javy (for example, <code>TextDecoder</code>/<code>TextEncoder</code>).</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"http://crates.io\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/75f8c66509c680a2345cca9b6adaf7e2cdb6f41b\\/68747470733a2f2f6372617465732e696f2f6173736574732f6f672d696d6167652e706e67)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"http://crates.io\" title=\"crates.io: Rust Package Registry\">crates.io: Rust Package Registry</a></div></div></div>",
