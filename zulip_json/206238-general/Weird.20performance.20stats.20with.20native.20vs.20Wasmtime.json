Since recently the Wasm interpreter is running faster via Wasmtime than native for some test cases which is very weird since usually the overhead is between 50-100% of native. Note that on other machines native performance is far superior. So this mostly affects our benchmark infra and also my MBP M2 machine. After lots of thinking and experimenting I am kinda out of ideas for what could cause this and would really love if someone is willing to throw in a hint, a wild guess or their thoughts. Thanks. :)</p>\n<p>Example benchmark CI run: <a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi/pull/863#issuecomment-1867846070\">https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi/pull/863#issuecomment-1867846070</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi/pull/863#issuecomment-1867846070\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/4470d66b64927d0ae028d09602d9fed07662a195\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f303863643566376334643139656334366664613334353932306639306638356231663130616530643661633863306536623931363731643234353933383731302f706172697479746563682f7761736d692f70756c6c2f383633)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi/pull/863#issuecomment-1867846070\" title=\"Prepare release of `v0.32.0-beta.2` by Robbepop 路 Pull Request #863 路 paritytech/wasmi\">Prepare release of `v0.32.0-beta.2` by Robbepop 路 Pull Request #863 路 paritytech/wasmi</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">WebAssembly (Wasm) interpreter.
