        "content": "<p>I recently ran into a toolchain issue, I believe with <code>wasm-ld</code>, where the <code>name</code> custom section was not emitted in the linked WebAssembly module. My current understanding is that the <code>name</code> custom section is added by the LLVM toolchain so that one can easily identify which function is which, instead of getting Wasm backtraces containing uninformative lines like <code>&lt;unknown&gt;!&lt;wasm function 23&gt;</code>.  I believe <code>wasm2wat</code> also uses the <code>name</code> custom section to use named IDs (e.g., <code>$foo</code>) for the function names in the translated WAT. In a small example where I <code>-c</code> compile two Wasm object files, I can see that they contain <code>linking</code> custom sections with name information and, when I link these files together, I do see the expected <code>name</code> custom section. But in a larger project, the <code>name</code> section is missing--does anyone know why this would be the case?</p>",
