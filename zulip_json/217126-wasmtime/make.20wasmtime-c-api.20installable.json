I've found <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/cargo-c\">https://crates.io/crates/cargo-c</a> but it looks like the project has to be specially configured to consume that (and it wants to generate the headers for you...). I don't really want to resort to just manually copying the libs to the right locations in my brew formula, but it looks like that's the only supported method right now..?</p>\n<p>Note that I'm not a rust developer (I'm rarely even a c developer) so most of this tooling is a little outside of my wheelhouse ;)</p>",
