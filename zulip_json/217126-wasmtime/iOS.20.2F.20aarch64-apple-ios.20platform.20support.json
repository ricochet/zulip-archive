The Swift wrapper Package runs on macOS when wasmtime is built for the aarch64-apple-darwin and x86_64-apple-darwin targets, however wasmtime doesn't <em>yet</em> appear to compile to iOS / aarch64-apple-ios. Would there be any interest in patches to get wasmtime building on aarch64-apple-ios, and is there a sense of how involved this task would be and if there would be any major barriers to getting this working?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/b5293a0c5216dad42542950b43f88eab995c3986\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f373061613761393332646632313063623337363936353534623162643361343334643234653431386162656339633439393331333937376132313531643138322f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652d7079)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py\" title=\"GitHub - bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py: Python WebAssembly runtime powered by Wasmtime\">GitHub - bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py: Python WebAssembly runtime powered by Wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Python WebAssembly runtime powered by Wasmtime.

It sounds like building <code>wasmtime</code> on iOS wouldn't be sufficient to be able to publish apps using <code>*.cwasm</code>, and we would need to fully implement the <code>*.cwasm</code> postprocessing to make this more broadly useful. For now I'm going to start looking into the build issues for the <code>aarch64-apple-ios</code> target as a first step. It would be good to understand in more detail what work is needed on the postprocessing front and how much of a lift this would be, and if there is interest from the wasmtime team in getting this integrated.</p>",
