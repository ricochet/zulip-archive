The project currently depends on wasmtime-9, wasi_common(preview 1) and bunch of other \"old\" stuff, I wonder should I upgraded it to wasmtime-24. My concern is that the preview2 doesn't seem to be supported yet as of rust-1.80, and does it make sense to use wasmtime-24::preview1 instead? Thanks.</p>",
