The last part that's fuzzy for me is around how the component model will work with WASI. Is WASI optional? The way I understand things, it should be optional. Earlier versions of this host created a module and inspected for WASI imports and then built up a wasi store if the module was wasi enabled. This is a little awkward with the component-model feature enabled. I want this host to work with wasm32-unknown-unknown ABI, wasm32-wasi-unknown, and wasm32-&lt;to be decided component triple&gt;.  Right now I'm building out the API to compile and instantiate a module or component (even if the API is just stubs). I have a component OR module working, just not WASI enabled.
