I don't think it would be terribly difficult to update it to support resource types (and anything else that's missing), but someone would need to volunteer to do the work.  I'd be happy to provide guidance, if needed.  Also, the C# generator has full resource support, so that could be useful as a reference.</p>",

Most of the code piggy backs of the csharp code and still needs a bit of testing but it generates and builds for now. I was wondering if you could tell me about RET_AREA if you don't mind. For wit bindgen is there an allocated memory space used to store return values? If that's true do you know how large it is and is there another area for complex objects? Thank you again!</p>",
