Module linking is mentioned there as a potential way to lower the memory usage of JS interpreters. The module linking repo is inactive, though, as per the note in <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-linking/blob/main/proposals/module-linking/Explainer.md\">the proposal</a>, which mentions the focus shifted towards the component model.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks I've been experimenting with running JavaScript code as WASM modules and memory is one of the limits for many use cases. As an example 5000 of SpiderMonkey WASM instances takes about 20-25GBs of RAM and even a smaller interpreter like QuickJS is at 2GBs.</p>\n<p>It would be a game changer if an interpreter could be loaded to memory as a component and shared between a number of instances running other components with memory being copied on write as needed. Is anything like that planned? Is it even feasible? Unfortunately I don't know much about WASM internals (I'm learning, though!), so I'm not sure if it's not a silly question.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/making-javascript-run-fast-on-webassembly\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/b0cea62b89ccf6d34ec3a4a8d45332741ed2f3f8/68747470733a2f2f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652e6f72672f61727469636c65732f696d672f323032312d30362d30322d6a732d6f6e2d7761736d2f66656174757265645f696d6167652e706e67&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/making-javascript-run-fast-on-webassembly\" title=\"Making JavaScript run fast on WebAssembly\">Making JavaScript run fast on WebAssembly</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">JavaScript in the browser runs many times faster than it did two decades ago.

There are two aspects to this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code reuse, e.g. compiling <code>libstarlingmonkey.so</code>, a JS interpreter, to a .cwasm file once and reusing it.  Code is immutable, so reuse is pretty trivial -- no CoW needed.</li>\n<li>Instance reuse, i.e. reusing the linear memory, globals, etc. of a live interpreter across multiple component instances</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The latter raises questions about reentrance, multithreading, CoW, etc., but the former is reasonably straightforward, as described in <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/Linking.md\">Linking.md</a>. </p>\n<p>Specifically, what we'd want is to create JS components which <em>import</em> e.g. <code>libstarlingmonkey.so</code> rather than bundle it.  That would give Wasmtime a chance to compile <code>libstarlingmonkey.so</code> to a cwasm file once, load it once, and reuse it across an arbitrary number of components.
