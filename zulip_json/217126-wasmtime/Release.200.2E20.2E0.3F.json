For a project that I'm working on we currently use a specific wasmtime commit that includes the serialization/deserialization of artifacts. This feature significantly increases productivity for iterative development, which is extremely helpful for the team.  With all the things going on for you guys this might not be top priority but I was just wondering :)</p>",
