The websys crate has <a href=\"https://docs.rs/web-sys/0.3.5/web_sys/struct.EventSource.html\"><code>web_sys::EventSource</code></a> which enables this by using JavaScript interop, but I can't find anything similar when using the wit-bindgen crate. There are a few crates for using SSE in pure rust here: <a href=\"https://crates.io/keywords/server-sent-events\">https://crates.io/keywords/server-sent-events</a>. But when I try to include any of them as a dependency in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file, I get compilation errors.</p>",
