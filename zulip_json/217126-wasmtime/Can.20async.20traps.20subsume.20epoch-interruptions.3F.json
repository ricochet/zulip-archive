        "content": "<p>During the work on slacked/async fuel metering, see <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4109\">#4109</a>, we converged on an idea of checking the fuel asynchronously. TL;DR: Slacked fuel metering allows to achieve overhead close to zero in many cases while preserving  determinism if the user can accept some concessions. </p>\n<p>It works roughly like this. We reserve a register for the fuel counter. The fuel counter is incremented at each BB. The thread executing wasm will be periodically interrupted. The interrupt handler would check if the thread was interrupted in wasm based on the value of the PC register. If it was, then the handler can read the fuel register. Then, the handler can initiate a trap. Semantically, that means a wasm module can be interrupted at any wasm PC. </p>\n<p>For macOS and Windows we would stop the thread, inspect its thread state, and if there is out-of-gas then modify the thread state, to land on a handler that would initiate unwinding.</p>\n<p>Which made me realize: this looks equivalent to what <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3699\">epoch-interruption</a> aims to achieve. Specifically, it provides an efficient way to interrupt wasm code non-deterministically (but 2-3x faster) based on some periodic signal by the embedder.</p>\n<p>Unlike epoch-interruption, async traps do not require inline synchronous checks on each epilogue and back edges. Instead, if we don't care about pretty stack traces during such async traps, then we don't need any modifications of compiled code. Or we can follow suggestion by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253994\">@Alex Crichton</span> <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4109#issuecomment-1134902184\">here</a>. In any case, this has ≈0 overhead.</p>\n<p>Also, I think async traps are a simpler and less-opinionated. Instead of having a single per-<code>Engine</code> counter that interrupts code in all stores that reached the deadline, per thread interruption is possible.</p>\n<p>Probably I am missing something here and it might have been perhaps discussed. If so, why did the mechanism that involves synchronous checks won compared to async traps? Similar to Alex's logic in the linked issue?</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"254389\">@Chris Fallin</span></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4109\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/5666ec2a7551b39213020dce52c17580f277e222\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f663639623766616264623061646266303630363437653236646636613466363866323930626639616432653330343764396134356230303433356632313937312f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652f6973737565732f34313039)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4109\" title=\"Slacked fuel metering · Issue #4109 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">Slacked fuel metering · Issue #4109 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">wasmtime right now has the fuel mechanism.

Integration of epochs is quite simple where a thread simply increments a single counter. Integration of async traps seems more complicated where handles to threads-running-wasm need to be maintained and the periodic thread iterates this list. This implies at least some degree of synchronization depending on system setup.</p>\n<p>Cost-wise given the benefits of async traps it may be worth investing in this design given how low-overhead they are!</p>",
