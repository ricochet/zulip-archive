A few thoughts come to mind; <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253994\">@Alex Crichton</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253990\">@fitzgen (he/him)</span> probably have more (and prefer their ideas over mine honestly):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There is work to finish the lower execution-backend tiers: Winch (fast baseline compiler) and Pulley (interpreter). <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"411395\">@Saúl Cabrera</span> is leading the winch efforts, Alex and Nick the Pulley efforts. Getting both to full parity with the Cranelift backend would be fantastic to have for completeness reasons (Winch is also part of our debugging plans, and Pulley is part of our embedded/portability story which has community implications), and would be a good way to get familiar with the runtime, the test suite, and various bits of the compiler infrastructure. It's also \"bitesize-friendly\": PRs to add support for each individual Wasm opcode/instruction are fine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the new person has some experience with profiling and performance optimization, we haven't had a focused effort on that in a bit, and the nature of things is that when we don't pay attention, little regressions often slip in. It would be great to have someone do comprehensive profiling, sort through what they find, and make a performance push if there's any low-hanging fruit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Big efforts ongoing or coming up include finishing GC (Nick), exception-handling support, debugging (many subparts). Not sure if any of those are really beginner-friendly but maybe if someone's interested specifically, there's a way to pitch in?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
