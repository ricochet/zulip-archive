I am thinking of compiling <code>flecs</code> ecs library into a wasm module. Then, I can provide it as a import to all of my plugins, which now get free ECS without having to statically link it themselves. But <code>flecs</code> provides pointers to its data, and with CM, it won't work due to shared-nothing approach. In that case, will it work if its just a normal wasm module? Can I link it to both non-CM and CM wasm plugins?</li>\n</ol>",
