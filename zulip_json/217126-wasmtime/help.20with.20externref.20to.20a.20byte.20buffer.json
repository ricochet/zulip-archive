        "content": "<p>I'm working on a sandbox environment for user defined functions in a data processing engine. It is a perfect use case for wasm, and even better it doesn't need interface types. I have a super simple need for the types on the wasm methods. All I need to do is be able to pass in a borrowed byte array into the method and it can return an owned byte array. This data processing engine expects to use a specific data serialization method inside WASM functions.  So I'm starting out with a really simple wasm module that takes a byte buffer and returns a number.  Once I have that working I'll expand out and actually parse the data with the serialization library.  Unfortunately I'm hitting a few issues on the way.</p>\n<p>So I've used two different signatures for this signature:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">#[no_mangle]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">unsafe</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">extern</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"C\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">udf</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">input</span>: <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"k\">const</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"kt\">u32</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">     </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>and </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">#[wasm_bindgen]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">udf</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">input_buffer</span>:  <span class=\"kp\">&amp;</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"p\">])</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"kt\">u32</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>that produces a method that either accepts 1 or 2 i32s respectively.  The problem is I want to invoke this using an ExternRef and I'm ussure how to bridge the gap.  If I just call it directly it will complain about \"expected externref found i32\"  which makes sense.  It is either a pointer or a pointer and length.  I found that wasm-bindgen has a --reference-types flag.  I'm not great at reading decompiled wasm yet so I don't know if it is giving me what I need.

It will then ship the WASM out to the executor nodes and allow you to use them as part of the query.  So I could say something like <code>SELECT levenshtein_distance(name1, name2) from foo</code> where levenshtein_distance is implemented with WASM.  The dream is that user's could use Rust,  C#, lua or whatever they are used to.  I'll probably need to make a pretty minor SDK for each supported lanaguage but so far it looks like they will be minor lifts for each.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista\">https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista</a></li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61914646?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista\" title=\"ballista-compute/ballista\">ballista-compute/ballista</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Distributed compute platform implemented in Rust, and powered by Apache Arrow. - ballista-compute/ballista</div></div></div>",
