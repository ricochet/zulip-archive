I have a small question around the API for epoch based interruption: is there a particular reason why the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/crates/wasmtime/src/store.rs#L1875\">EpochDeadlineError</a> isn't publicly exposed? We are currently migrating to epoch based interruption from the previous approach in which the API returned a <code>TrapCode::Interrupt</code> to signal an interruption in execution. Would it make sense to expose it? Or perhaps I'm missing something and there's an equivalent way to <code>TrapCode::Interrupt</code> to determine when the execution was interrupted?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/crates/wasmtime/src/store.rs#L1875\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/bc53807040b5e2c344fdd6943b544889a18f3063\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f663561333061626663626363333166383430336535626633353365366366346662376361376232646131396530373164373563626531323833666235616363372f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d65)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/crates/wasmtime/src/store.rs#L1875\" title=\"wasmtime/store.rs at main · bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">wasmtime/store.rs at main · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Standalone JIT-style runtime for WebAssembly, using Cranelift - wasmtime/store.rs at main · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</div></div></div>",
