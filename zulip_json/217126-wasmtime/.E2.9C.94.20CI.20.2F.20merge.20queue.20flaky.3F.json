But my understanding is that job is the job that is just joining all the other jobs we fanned out, and isn't actually doing anything itself? So I am not sure why it is even doing anything before all the tests have finished?</p>\n<p>Anyone else seen this? Know what's going on?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6789\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/de8736a1c5085d18d0d49ad8baedc4481b804443\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f623836306633663737616632653933333763386331353163303965323065656265653161623338333938643534376135373262373632633637306232623563652f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652f70756c6c2f36373839)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6789\" title=\"Wasmtime: Introduce `{Module,Component}::resources_required` by fitzgen · Pull Request #6789 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">Wasmtime: Introduce `{Module,Component}::resources_required` by fitzgen · Pull Request #6789 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Returns a summary of the resources required to instantiate this module or component.\nPotential uses of the returned information:\n\n\nDetermining whether your pooling allocator configuration supports ...</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/5731092473/job/15531362535\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/220655815e2e1750c71a8ab54d9431f995404748\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f353862323834343430656334383462666461393932633736303036306361363831323237616234303139623937323534663663633530353162616236373737362f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d65)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/5731092473/job/15531362535\" title=\"CI · bytecodealliance/wasmtime@3a8dff8\">CI · bytecodealliance/wasmtime@3a8dff8</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">A fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly.
