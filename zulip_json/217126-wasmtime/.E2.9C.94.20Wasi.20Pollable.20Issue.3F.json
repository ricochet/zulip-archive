        "content": "<p>Posting here just incase someone has seem a similar issue. I have a situation where my event loop subscribes to a set of different resources(socket connects, reads, writes). It then grabs all the pollables, supplies all those pollables to a poll() function and then does some operation on them(finish-connect etc). The issue is that im getting an unknown resource index sometimes when the set is big enough during this whole event operation. I was wondering if anyone has ever seen something like this? Could be something else in the code as well</p>",

I'm printing out the handles as they come but at one particular moment the handle index just changes to a number I haven't seen before. Maybe my binary is doing something weird with the memory</p>",
