Second, rust (and possibly other) examples using interface types are broken, how long do you think it would take to make <code>wasm-bindgen</code> and <code>wasmtime</code>to work together or is it still too experimental to tell? Lastly, is there a possibility one could help the project in any way?</p>",

Regarding the docs, do you mean Wasmtime API docs (i.e. <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/0.12.0/wasmtime/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/0.12.0/wasmtime/\">https://docs.rs/wasmtime/0.12.0/wasmtime/</a>) or other documentation?  Regarding interface types, Wasmtime implemented an experimental (and very early) interface types proposal and hasn't yet made an update to a more recent version of the proposal.  As a result,  the interface types examples/demos are broken currently for Wasmtime.  For some context, see the \"What to do about our Interface Types support\" topic in the Wasmtime zulip stream.</p>",
