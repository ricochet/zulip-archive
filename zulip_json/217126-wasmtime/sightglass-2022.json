I think <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253990\">@fitzgen (he/him)</span> is out of town right now and I won't be working for the next two weeks, but I am trying to follow up on that discussion.

It allows a benchmark that has been compiled to a native target (not the Wasm target) and linked with sightglass to be run through sightglass and with a similar report out as to what the Wasm benchmarking shows. Its just the initial patch though and currently is only supported by the shootout subset of benchmarks.</p>",
