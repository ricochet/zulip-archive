In the future, one could use resources to do that (<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6583\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6583</a>). So right now, if I want to call two separate webassembly functions create_image and process_image from the host, I would have to put  the image into a List and basically copy the image from WebAssembly to the host and from the host back to webassembly. With a ressource, I could use a handle to avoid copying the whole image.<br>\nDo I understand this correctly?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6583\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/8bfa3ce38d9444316e37ff66ac1a1abaa10f14ce\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f386633323633373635323537316531333430626434373164626265613235333230616337303637376264313832356239656264376633326636376236323661332f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652f6973737565732f36353833)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6583\" title=\"Implement resources for the component model 路 Issue #6583 路 bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">Implement resources for the component model 路 Issue #6583 路 bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">This is intended to be a bit of a tracking issue and/or brain-dump about implementing resources in the component model.
