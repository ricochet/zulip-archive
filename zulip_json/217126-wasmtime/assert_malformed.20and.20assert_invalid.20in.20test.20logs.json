We can probably stop logging them, since they're expected. The one complication, IIRC, is that the spec testsuite has specific error messages it is testing for, and we don't always match the message exactly. I'll take a peek again to confirm this.</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253991\">@Yury Delendik</span> -- I think you originally wrote the spec testsuite integration?</p>",
