        "content": "<p>Hi! I'm trying to experiment with using Kotlin for a guest module which is now possible with the latest Wasmtime builds fully supporting Wasm GC. </p>\n<p>To pass rich data to guests compiled in other stacks I've experimented with (e.g. TinyGo, AssemblyScript), I've used various versions of <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> to store data in the guest linear memory and pass a pointer to that data when calling a guest function. With Kotlin it seems this pattern wouldn't work since it doesn't provide a <code>malloc</code> function nor means to implement it manually. Essentially it only allows allocations within a <code>withScopedMemoryAllocator { }</code> lambda call and allocations made inside it will be garbage collected after the lambda completes.  </p>\n<p>As far as I can understand the only way to pass rich data to a Kotlin function (other than using stdin I guess) would be to do something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">@</span><span class=\"n\">OptIn</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">UnsafeWasmMemoryApi</span><span class=\"p\">::</span><span class=\"n\">class</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"o\">@</span><span class=\"n\">WasmExport</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"func_with_string_arg\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">fun</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">funcWithStringArg</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">stringSize</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nc\">Int</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">withScopedMemoryAllocator</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">allocator</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">-&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nc\">val</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ptr</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">allocator</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">allocate</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">stringSize</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">storeData</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ptr</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">address</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">toInt</span><span class=\"p\">())</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// this calls the host which should now store the string at the provided address</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"c1\">// read the data at ptr</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This means that a host function <code>storeData</code> will be called from the guest while the host is calling the guest function <code>funcWithStringArg</code>. Does Wasmtime provide any means to connect these calls (the call chain might be deeper)?</p>\n<p>I'm embedding Wasmtime in Go using <code>wasmtime-go</code>, the interface for a host exported function is like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">caller</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">wasmtime</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Caller</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">args</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[]</span><span class=\"n\">wasmtime</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Val</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">([]</span><span class=\"n\">wasmtime</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Val</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">wasmtime</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Trap</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The only relevant thing I can find here is <code>caller.Context()</code> but it is an opaque object, nothing can be stored in it as far as I can tell. Looks like I can store some sort of hashmap on the host side in the form of <code>(storelikeReference, someId) =&gt; data</code>, generate <code>someId</code> when calling a guest function and expect the guest to pass back <code>someId</code> when calling <code>storeData</code> so that the host can understand what data the guest requests? I.e. something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">@</span><span class=\"n\">OptIn</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">UnsafeWasmMemoryApi</span><span class=\"p\">::</span><span class=\"n\">class</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"o\">@</span><span class=\"n\">WasmExport</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"func_with_string_arg\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">fun</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">funcWithStringArg</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">stringSize</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nc\">Int</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">dataId</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Int</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">withScopedMemoryAllocator</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">allocator</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">-&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nc\">val</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ptr</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">allocator</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">allocate</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">stringSize</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">storeData</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ptr</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">address</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">toInt</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">dataId</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// host can understand by dataId what data to store at ptr</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"c1\">// read the data at ptr</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This approach seems error prone and pretty convoluted, I really hope there are other options but I can't find anything relevant in the docs. Maybe there is a better approach?<br>\nThanks!</p>",

Ideally it would be possible to call an allocator without first entering into Kotlin as that'll make this much easier, but that may also be a lot of work.</p>\n<p>Otherwise though what you can do is from the host function use the <code>Caller</code> as the context to get a memory's data/len pointers. In wasmtime-go I don't think we have it bound but in Rust there's <code>Caller::get_export</code> to make loading the memory easier. In Go though you can create your callback and then acquire memory after the wasm instance is created and arrange for the memory to be accessible from the callback</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thank you for the response. </p>\n<p>Well yes, there is a way to get access to the guest memory from the <code>caller</code> in <code>wasmtime-go</code> too. What I don't like in this approach is that when a host wants to call a guest function that accepts rich data and returns rich data, instead of just calling a guest function, the interaction becomes split in several and requires keeping some sort of a global state on the host side:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The host calls the guest function while storing the argument data <em>somewhere</em> (some sort of a global variable I guess?)</li>\n<li>During the (1) call the guest function calls the host back with a pointer to the buffer where the host can write the argument data to. The host has to somehow understand that this call is in related to (1). There might be many guests running at once, the only way to differentiate them is by using the <code>caller</code>, right? But can we get a caller reference before the guest callback? I mean in (1) we don't have a <code>caller</code> instance yet, should something from the <code>store</code> be used to connect call in (1) and the guest callback?</li>\n<li>Then when the guest wants to return data from the function call it apparently can't simply write it to the linear memory and return a pointer because after the function call (1) completes, all allocations will be garbage-collected. So I guess to return data from the function call the guest again would have to call some host function that accepts the result of the (1) call. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>The guest function would look something like that:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">fun</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">funcWithStringArg</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">stringSize</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nc\">Int</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">callId</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Int</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">withScopedMemoryAllocator</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">allocator</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">-&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"c1\">// allocate a buffer for the argument</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">callHostToStoreArgumentData</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">argBufPtr</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">address</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">toInt</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">callId</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// host can understand by callId arguments of which call are requested</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"c1\">// execute the function body</span>\n<span class=\"w\">   </span><span class=\"c1\">// store the function result data in the linear memory</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">callHostToReturnResultData</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">resultDataPtr</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">address</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">toInt</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">callId</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// host can understand by callId which call returned the result</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I just can't believe this is how it is supposed to be done <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>.

Wasm lives in a separate address space which the host must copy into, and that's a fundamental property of sandboxing WebAssembly.</p>\n<p>If you're interested this is what the component model is intended to solve. There's not integration of the component model in the wasmtime-go bindings right now but at a high-level the component model is exactly tasked with communicating high-level data into and out of wasm modules. </p>\n<p>As for how to implement this all, there's various techniques in the Rust <code>wasmtime</code> crate for example but we don't always do the best job of mapping 100% of them into per-language bindings. For example the most common way in Rust to store state is to put it in the <code>T</code> of <code>Store&lt;T&gt;</code> which you can access from <code>Caller&lt;T&gt;</code>. A custom <code>void*</code> pointer can be set on a store which I think can be accessed in the C API (IIRC, I may be misremembering) which I don't believe is bound in Go yet. In that sense this could be something that could be improved in wasmtime-go.</p>",

So, it seems unlikely that it would be possible to make use of the component model from anything other than Rust in the near future unfortunately.  In general, my early impression from experimenting with WebAssembly for several weeks is that for non-browser use cases Wasm works great when both the host and guests use Rust. In almost any other  stack I've tried, Wasm/WASI support is, at best, highly experimental, with various compatibility and performance issues <span aria-label=\"unamused\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f612\" role=\"img\" title=\"unamused\">:unamused:</span>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example the most common way in Rust to store state is to put it in the T of Store&lt;T&gt; which you can access from Caller&lt;T&gt;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you, I will look into that.</p>",
