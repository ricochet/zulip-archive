And so im trying to load and drop modules to the linker, but i just noticed that there is no drop mechanism included in the linker; from that, i can conclude that (A) i'm not using the linker how it should be used, and (B) there is an alternative surely that im not aware of.<br>\nSo how do i do that, load and drop modules without having to create a linker each time ?<br>\nthank you in advance !</p>",
