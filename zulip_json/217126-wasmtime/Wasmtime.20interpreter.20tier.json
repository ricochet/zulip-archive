There was a call for help with respect to a planned interpreter tier for Wasmtime. What is planned for this? What are the requirements for this interpreter tier? What is going to be its purpose and focus? Is there already existing work/branch or a PoC? How can people like me help? Thanks. :)</p>\n<p>So far I have worked on <code>wasmi</code> which is a rewriting Wasm interpreter with a focus on a balance between compile performance and execution performance.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/wasmtime-and-cranelift-in-2023\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/b666ca74a20745aca2566cd241108afdcfa09d04\\/68747470733a2f2f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652e6f72672f696d616765732f6176617461722e706e67)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/wasmtime-and-cranelift-in-2023\" title=\"Wasmtime and Cranelift in 2023\">Wasmtime and Cranelift in 2023</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Itâ€™s that time of year: time to start winding down for the winter holidayseason, time to reflect on the past year, and time to think about what we canaccomplish together in 2024.

I was asking because I am currently just looking for ways to collaborate more closely with the Bytecode Alliance and was recently made aware of the interpreter tier ideas.
