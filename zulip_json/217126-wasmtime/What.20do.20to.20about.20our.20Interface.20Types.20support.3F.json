        "content": "<p>I wanted to start a discussion here about whether we should remove the interface types support in wasmtime today. I think there's a few strong technical reasons we should do this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>wasmtime-interface-types</code> crate is basically entirely tech debt</li>\n<li>We have no tests on <code>wasmtime</code>'s CI, so this breaks often</li>\n<li>The current version of <code>wasm-bindgen</code> supports a different version of wasm interface types</li>\n<li>Previously you could use older versions of <code>wasm-bindgen</code> to work with <code>wasmtime</code>, but now with <code>wasm-webidl-bindings</code> being updated in <code>wasmtime</code> it's not possible to find a matching <code>wasm-bindgen</code> version to match the binary encoding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or, put another way, the current support is all tech debt, there's no tests, and it's impossible to get working today. On a technical level what needs to happen is that we need to update the <code>wasmtime</code> crate (and C API) with support for interface types. At the bare minimum to get the Rust examples work again we need to update the <code>wasmtime</code> crate. I started this work a long time ago but didn't get too too far. It wouldn't be too hard to get it up and working again but filling it out to implement all of interface types (or at least what <code>wasm-bindgen</code> supports) will be a good chunk of time.</p>\n<p>So, this leads us to the question, what do we do? With everything broken right now I feel like we need to do something, but our options seem to be either (a) remove all support and document that support will come back soon or (b) I should take time to fully integrate the next iteration of interface types in to <code>wasmtime</code>.</p>",
