In that sense it's like JS where the wasm engine doesn't provide any imports by default and all imports must be supplied by JS. In a Wasmtime embedding (e.g. Rust for example) you can define any function with any name. On the CLI you're limited to WASI functions as the only ones that are built-in by default.</p>",
