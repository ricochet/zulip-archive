In my case, I wouldn't exactly consider a situation where a PAC trap is encountered at runtime to be a fault in cranelift itself, I would consider it a bug in the wasm guest code, just like MTE prevents buffer overflows, use after frees, which I also consider wasm guest errors, not errors in the cranelift compiler. <br>\nIn this situation, if I possibly can, I would like to exit with an error similar to how I implemented with MTE. MTE was quite simple, I just had to compare a linux constant (<code>SEGV_MTESERR</code>) with the si_code. But I think/read online that identifying PAC traps/exceptions is more complicated. In my understanding, a PAC trap would cause a <code>SIGILL</code>, but that can mean many different problems, not necessarily a PAC error. However, I am not sure how I could continue from there. I read that PAC traps are asynchronous, meaning that by the time the signal handler receives the <code>SIGILL</code> signal, the program might have advanced beyond where the PAC error actually occured. So maybe an analysis to detect whether the encountered trap is a PAC trap is non-deterministic at best, and probably quite hard to implement.</p>",
