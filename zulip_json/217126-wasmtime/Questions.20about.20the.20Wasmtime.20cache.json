I'm using a rust crate that uses Wasmtime to handle a plugin system (Extism, you all have probably heard of it).</p>\n<p>My program usually has a very short runtime, but compiling WASM into something that can be executed adds a lot of wait time the first time the program is run after a while. There's only very specific conditions under which the plugins should really be recompiled from the Wasm, and I think I'm capable of handling these myself. Extism doesn't expose anything like this - but is it possible at all with Wasmtime?</p>\n<p>I suppose this is equivalent to giving my project a permanent cache? Except, of course, I would like to delete the cached stuff on those occasions where recompiling is a thing I want</p>",
