Any suggestions? </p>\n<p>Basically, I was about to release a blog post about using some components stuff and had used wasmlink to glue it all together (plus wit-bindgen-wasmtime to actually call a function). But all I saw was mention of the updated components model, which I can't use yet because the wasmtime dependencies of the bindgen stuff are still at 0.35 (pre component model support, which I don't think is in a released version of wasmtime yet?). Is there a way I can get things working with all of these new features?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/pull/239\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/6f8125aa8168005fbfbcbbba06900bdd65d24797\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f633930643966373732396339303936613932373033336438343339383737623934626439336661353139653830313063383634323133633865313739663464622f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7769742d62696e6467656e2f70756c6c2f323339)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/pull/239\" title=\"wit-component: update to latest component model proposal. by peterhuene · Pull Request #239 · bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen\">wit-component: update to latest component model proposal. by peterhuene · Pull Request #239 · bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">This PR updates and refactors wit-component so that it produces\ncomponents compatible with the latest component model proposal changes.\nMost of the big changes were to the encoding, which also was ...</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/pull/240\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/10e5014aea3711e7ec6460a16ceebb329bc3a9f9\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f373939363331636538323365656262376238356165656138613032343134323338363465343237346336666136316631353465376332636230346539663839312f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7769742d62696e6467656e2f70756c6c2f323430)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/pull/240\" title=\"Remove `wasmlink`, `wasmlink-cli`, and `test-modules`. by peterhuene · Pull Request #240 · bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen\">Remove `wasmlink`, `wasmlink-cli`, and `test-modules`. by peterhuene · Pull Request #240 · bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">This PR removes wasmlink, wasmlink-cli, and test-modules from the\nwit-bindgen repo.\nwasmlink is based on an outdated module linking proposal and predates any of\nthe work on the component model.

A replacement for <code>wasmlink</code> is definitely required and is very much on the short-term radar, but some design work is necessary to implement it properly (if you've seen Luke's earlier presentations on the component model to the WG, he discussed linker scripts to fully describe how dependencies get linked together; the design would mostly be in that space).  </p>\n<p><code>wasmlink</code> never worked with \"components\" since it predates the component model; it only operates on \"core\" wasm modules with the module linking proposal extensions; it had no way of representing the complex type system of components and so it had to inject adapter code in core wasm directly in the linked output to make things \"work\" with an unmodified wasmtime. Fundamentally, it was a tool to show off the vision long before we had a standards proposal to go off of.</p>\n<p>As things stand today, we have tooling around creating actual wasm components (I'm about to open up <code>cargo-component</code> to make it easy to in Rust) and there's quite a bit of progress from Alex in implementing executing single components (passing in complex data, getting complex data out). He's now actively working on nested component instantiation which will move us towards being able to use a fully linked component graph, so it makes sense we'd want a tool to create one very soon.</p>\n<p>If you want to show off what you could do with wasmlink, I think you'll have to stick with wasmlink and older versions of the other tools (current wasmtimes can't even run the output of wasmlink as module linking support was removed).</p>",
