It looks like it's been failing for quite some time and the failure at the beginning is at least different than the failure it has right now. I can't reproduce the failure myself locally, but are there perhaps configuration or environment variables set on the CI machine? For example is debuginfo enabled for release builds or something like that? </p>\n<p>If you can log into the machine itself you can try running <code>cargo +nightly config get -Z unstable-options</code> to print out what Cargo thinks its configuration is</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://buildkite.com/embark-studios/wasmtime-aarch64-apple-darwin\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/1b2feb97868ccc3770d79759665b507bacde56de\\/68747470733a2f2f6275696c646b6974656173736574732e636f6d2f6173736574732f6f70656e67726170685f64656661756c742d623932396463376366343339643064346161633232326339366262383266383732353332633465333834623530333365383131383438653937333536613033302e706e67)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://buildkite.com/embark-studios/wasmtime-aarch64-apple-darwin\" title=\"wasmtime-aarch64-apple-darwin · Embark Studios\">wasmtime-aarch64-apple-darwin · Embark Studios</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Branches for wasmtime-aarch64-apple-darwin: Pipeline for cloning and testing wasmtime on aarch64-apple-darwin</div></div></div>",

We no longer use the Mac machines for anything but running test binaries, so it's probably something just related to outdated cargo/rust/system deps, so hopefully a simple update will fix things. I'll take a look sometime this week.</p>",
