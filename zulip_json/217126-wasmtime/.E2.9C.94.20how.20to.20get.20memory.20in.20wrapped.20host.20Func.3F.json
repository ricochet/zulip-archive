One of the arguments to the function is a guest pointer (not in the wiggle sense, but a raw <code>u32</code>). Right now I'm storing the <code>Memory</code> in the <code>WasiCtx</code> <code>table</code> to be looked up through the <code>Caller</code> I receive as a parameter. This seems like a hack, though. Is there a better way to go about this? Instantiation order (the instance is exporting the memory) means I can't pass it in through the closure.</p>",
