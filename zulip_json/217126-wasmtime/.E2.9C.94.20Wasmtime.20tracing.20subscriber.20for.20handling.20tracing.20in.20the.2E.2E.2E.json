You'd then write a <code>tracing-subscriber</code> lookalike that would route logging messages to this interface. That's the specification for both the guest and then from a host perspective that's what you'd get to work with from guests. Exactly how <code>tracing</code> primitives would map into WIT I'm not sure, I don't know enough about <code>tracing</code> myself</p>",
