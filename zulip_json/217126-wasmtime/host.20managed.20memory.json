This is quite important for our use case at DFINITY. In particular, we need to ensure that either 1) once allocated, the memory does not move or 2) if the memory needs to be moved we need to know when and where. We also need to know when <code>memory.grow</code> occurs.</p>\n<p>Andreas Rossberg explored this in <code>wasm-c-api</code>:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api/blob/host-mem/example/mmap.cc#L290\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api/blob/host-mem/example/mmap.cc#L290\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api/blob/host-mem/example/mmap.cc#L290</a></p>\n<p>We, at DFINITY (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"266298\">@Krzysztof Woś</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"266161\">@Maciej Kot</span> ), would like to contribute this feature to wasmtime. I was experimenting with this while back (the code is horribly outdated by now) and the plumbing to make it work wasn't very complicated. The interesting part would be designing a clean API.</p>\n<p>What is your thinking on this? What would be a good way to proceed?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api/blob/host-mem/example/mmap.cc#L290\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11578470?s=400&amp;v=4)\" target=\"_blank\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api/blob/host-mem/example/mmap.cc#L290\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WebAssembly/wasm-c-api\">WebAssembly/wasm-c-api</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Wasm C API prototype.
