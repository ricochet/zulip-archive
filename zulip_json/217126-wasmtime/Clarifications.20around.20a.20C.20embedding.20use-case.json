        "content": "<p>Hi all,</p>\n<p>As I find myself working on a PoC embedding wasmtime in a large C application, I have a few questions which the documentation seems to not answer (it appears that the \"C embedding\" use-case isn't quite well documented yet). I hope that it's fine to ask for a few clarifications here (topics touch both WASI and wasmtime, so I am posting in this channel).<br>\nMy use-case is to lookup for entrypoints/hooks in the compiled wasm module (e.g. <code>init</code> and <code>exit</code> \"hooks\"), and, if they are defined, call those at given points in the lifetime of the C application.</p>\n<p>The few points on which I am eager for clarifications for now are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Is there a better way to lookup for exported symbols other than looping over <code>wasm_exporttype_vec_t</code>? Most of the C examples export a single symbol _or_ simply invoke <code>_start</code>, but these examples seem rather simplistic. For now, I have: <code>for (i=0; i&lt;wasm_exports.size;i++) { /* get wasm_name_t* */ if (strncmp(wasm_name-&gt;data, \"init\", wasm_name-&gt;size)) { /* ... */ } }</code>. However that seems a little contrived compared to the Rust interface which supports a more elegant and efficient <code>instance.get_func(\"init\")</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As far as I can tell, only the <code>threads.c</code> example from wasm-c-api touches on the topic of multi-threaded applications, and how modules/instances should be created and managed. In my case, my application is single-threaded and uses non-blocking (event-driven) I/O.<br>\n    a. In this case, how should I organize my wasm stores/modules/instances? Can each green-thread reuse the same instance? Modules? Stores? My thinking for the time being is to have all green threads share the same <code>wasm_module_t</code>, but to have each of them create their own <code>wasm_instance_t</code>. <br>\n    b. What if each green-thread reuses the same <code>wasm_instance_t</code>? Can I expect each call to <code>wasmtime_func_call()</code> to have its own stack frame? This way, all green-threads would execute on their own stack, but could share global variables?<br>\n    c. And finally, is it fine for the <code>wasm_store_t</code> to be shared between green-threads? Do stores only come in play when security concerns enter the picture?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using WASI, do each of my <code>wasm_instance_t</code> need their own <code>wasi_instance_t</code>, or can all <code>wasm_instance_t</code> share the same <code>wasi_instance_t</code>? I assume the former, but am hoping for confirmation. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Given that my C application implements event-driven I/O (i.e. <code>epoll</code>), does wasmtime have some sort of support for yielding from calls and resuming? I.e. suspend the WASM execution until some I/O finishes. If not, is such support planned in the future?  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And finally, is there a place in the documentation that better describe the role fulfilled by the stores/modules/instances/wasi instances as well as their cost? Did I miss it?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since my C embedding use-case seems fairly typical and somewhat large in scope, I'd be happy to help out improving the wasmtime C embedding experience as well; mostly hoping to get more familiar with it for the time being.</p>\n<p>That's it for now, TIA to folks who will spend some time reading these!</p>",
