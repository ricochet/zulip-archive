I've noticed that for the wasmtime repo and its releases, <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories\">security advisories</a> are issued, and they will cause github to trigger <a href=\"https://github.com/wapc/wasmtime-provider/issues/14\">warnings</a> in projects that depend on a certain wasmtime version. now, envy kicks in: wasmtime-go seems to have no such thing. I also don't know if it's related to rust (rustsec?) or how it all came to be, I was just thinking it would be nice if the other-lang-embeddings were notified in some similar way... <span aria-label=\"thinking\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f914\" role=\"img\" title=\"thinking\">:thinking:</span></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories\" style=\"background-image: url(https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/open_graph/github-octocat.png)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories\" title=\"Build software better, together\">Build software better, together</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">GitHub is where people build software.
