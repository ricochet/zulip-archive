There are a few old beginner issues, but I'm not sure if they still have people working on them. I am also fairly new to rust so would probably need some mentoring, is that a thing people have time for? It's quite a lot to ask, as I can imagine maintainers \"waste\" quite a lot of time on mentoring new contributors that don't stick around, but at least a no would be appreciated <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>\n<p>Tldr:<br>\nAre there any good first issues that don't currently have someone working on them, and do you have time to deal with inexperienced contributors?</p>",
