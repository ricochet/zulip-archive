It's not keeping up with the new (WASI) features.<br>\nLikely I am naive, but isn't it possible to expose and use the Rust API the same way to be consumed by other languages and there would be less maintenance effort?<br>\nSpecific pain points:<br>\nIn C API: <a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/c-api/wasi_8h.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/c-api/wasi_8h.html</a>  only the following are supported - env, directory, stdio, args. But nowadays WASI defines also: random, http, clocks... . It would be useful to give fine-grained access to these to have the \"capability-based security model\". <br>\nAlso component model is not supported in C API which limits the usability of the dependent host APIs in the future: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6987\">Add component model support to the c-api · Issue #6987 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime (github.com)</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6987\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/bde864a03ef514d6464824f42e2044edb70377bb/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f643933313561373864323065303638346261666561363339366239336266613931653066333738643831333866633065656663396166326438386435326233302f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652f6973737565732f36393837&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6987\" title=\"Add component model support to the c-api · Issue #6987 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">Add component model support to the c-api · Issue #6987 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Feature Add component model support to the c-api (particularly the ability run a component from a c-api host).

Someone's still got to do the work to integrate with each language. At this time it doesn't seem like it's all that much more work to implement something in the C API first and then bind it in languages.</p>",
