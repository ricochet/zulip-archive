        "content": "<p>Hi, I have been part of a project working on using wasm with Wasmtime to perform ML inference using wasi-nn with an onnx backend. This has been successful and we have an early mvp working. Thanks also for the support to my questions from the community here, it has been very helpful.</p>\n<p>An extension of this project requires us to run this module via a Kotlin Android App, to be called via JNI, Java Native Interface in C. </p>\n<p>I've searched through threads here and can see that currently there doesn't seem to be a plan to have Wasmtime built for android arm64 architecture. I found a few threads here: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6480\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6480</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3921\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3921</a></p>\n<p>Currently we are in the process of adapting our wasi-http and wasi-nn interfaces to  be able to use both Wasmtime and WasmEdge (which can be compiled for android). However we have found that the wasi-nn implementations between Wasmtime and WasmEdge are subtly different and require a sizeable amount of code to adapt between them. Going forward, managing compatibility with multiple wasm runtimes and wasi interfaces adds a lot of complexity and ideally we would like to stick to just using Wasmtime.</p>\n<p>Does anybody know if maintaining a Wasmtime build for android is in the roadmap and if so when it might be expected? Also are there any recommendations for managing wasi interface differences between runtimes if we need to be able to use multiple runtimes, any insights are much appreciated <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nGareth</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6480\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/ab7effc84b1138c1e69b413d0eb555e80cdd7ba6\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f643138623738376562653037633434636637373737383363353965313862636335346261626635316637396639313434613662613233646437643939383331652f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652f70756c6c2f36343830)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6480\" title=\"Android release binaries by martindevans · Pull Request #6480 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">Android release binaries by martindevans · Pull Request #6480 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">As discussed here.

Yes at the moment we are using the component model with wasi-nn in Wasmtime, we based it off the example code from David Justice. With WasmEdge we are not currently using the component model, although I think they are working on it. I will try and check out the wasi-nn meeting sometime :)  We are also interested in model training, do you think that would be a long way off?</p>",
