I was talking with Nick today and realized that we might have an easier time doing this if we copied the wasmtime-cpp bindings into the repository as well (it's sort of \"just\" a header file), which would enable using C++ testing frameworks like wasmtime-cpp already has. </p>\n<p>I was curious if you'd made enough progress that a change like this isn't something we should consider at all? Or if this would perhaps unlock anything you're thinking about?</p>",
