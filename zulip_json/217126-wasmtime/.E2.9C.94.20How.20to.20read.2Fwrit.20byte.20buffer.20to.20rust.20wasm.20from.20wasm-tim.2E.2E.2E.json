Can some one help me do that?</p>\n<p>I was following <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/tree/main/examples/allocation/rust\">https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/tree/main/examples/allocation/rust</a> as a reference, was able to do it in wazero but stuck trying to do the same in wasmtime -go. The allocate function seems to be returning a pointer address much larger than size of wasm buffer, in case of wazero it always was a direct mapping so that I can read/write from linear byte array</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/tree/main/examples/allocation/rust\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/622096439b7225dd3cbeb26aa4013036e88eb9bb\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f393735346231386338623732336661663830313561333631626437353964373262616632353230656634366434363165616636313839376635396431636433342f746574726174656c6162732f77617a65726f)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/tree/main/examples/allocation/rust\" title=\"wazero/examples/allocation/rust at main · tetratelabs/wazero\">wazero/examples/allocation/rust at main · tetratelabs/wazero</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">wazero: the zero dependency WebAssembly runtime for Go developers - wazero/examples/allocation/rust at main · tetratelabs/wazero</div></div></div>",
