WasiDir is implemented by the <code>wasmtime_wasi::sync::dir::Dir</code> type which has the from_cap_std function. This function takes a <code>wasmtime_wasi::sync::Dir</code> as argument, which you can construct using the <code>from_ambient_dir</code> function. The <code>AmbientAuthority</code> argument can be constructed using <code>wasmtime_wasi::sync::ambient_authority()</code>.</p>",
