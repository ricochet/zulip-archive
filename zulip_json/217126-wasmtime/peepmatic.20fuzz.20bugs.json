I wouldn't consider that significantly lowering the signal-to-noise ratio, and I don't think it warrants as strong a reaction as disabling all of peepmatic's fuzz targets. Running fuzz targets continuously is super valuable, but if as time goes on it turns out that if it really is drowning out other reports, than we can reconsider.</p>",
