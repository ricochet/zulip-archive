So, my limited understanding is that modules can only make calculations with integers and floats unless they use \"host functions\" that are exposed in the host environment (Wasmtime). Are groups of related host functions called a component (in the component model)? Where can I see a list of all the host functions and track the progress of any new host functions that are being added? And finally, is audio possible in Wasmtime yet? Can I write a buffer of audio to the soundcard using some Wasmtime host function?</p>",

        "content": "<p>The <code>wasmtime</code> crate embedding API is sort of at a different abstraction level than you may be thinking. Using the <code>wasmtime</code> crate you have the ability of providing any host function as input, but there are no pre-defined host functions for you to choose from. Audio for example is possible but you would need to design yourself what the API looks like, how to expose it, and how to implement it. Currently there is no name for a group of host functions at the embedder level.</p>\n<p>What you may be referring to though is WASI which is a standard definition of host APIs (e.g. file reading/writing/etc). I'm not personally aware of audio APIs in WASI but others may be. WASI is going to be defined in terms of \"instances\" sort of but I don't think any official name has been decided on for a group of functions, but it is organized into modules/instance along the lines of <code>wasi-fs</code>, <code>wasi-random</code>, <code>wasi-clock</code>, etc.</p>",
