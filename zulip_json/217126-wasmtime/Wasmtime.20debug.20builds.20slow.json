However, building debug builds takes 20s and release builds something like 5min.<br>\nHence a question: do you know if it's possible to build a debug build of my binary, but with a release build of wasmtime that'd get cached while I iterate on my code? It'd much decrease my time to test :)<br>\nI've already tried just disabling debug assertions, hoping that was it, but it turns out it doesn't significantly help</p>",
