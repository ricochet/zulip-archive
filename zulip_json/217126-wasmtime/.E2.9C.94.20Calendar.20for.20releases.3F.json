        "content": "<p>Hi there! I was wondering where's the planned next release of Wasmtime, so we can decide whether to wait for a release, or to maintain a fork of our own to cherry-pick some fixes that are of particular interest to us. I've looked at the RFC and what it says is <code>This RFC proposes releasing Wasmtime on Tuesday every 4 weeks. The precise date of each release may be adjusted to avoid coinciding with public holidays, though, which could result in some releases being a slightly different width apart.</code>. So I can proooooobably compute the next release date based on the previous one, but that might be imprecise because of the second sentence. Is there a list of releases with associated dates somewhere, that I missed? (If not, would it be interesting to set up something like that?) I'm thinking about something simple, consider: <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar\">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar</a> but with even fewer columns, only version number and date. Could come also pretty handy to answer specific queries like \"knowing the date of a commit, in which release is it?\" with a quick glance at such a table.</p>",
