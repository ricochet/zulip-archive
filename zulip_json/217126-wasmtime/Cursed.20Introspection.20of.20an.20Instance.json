Thankfully, the module will be completely off the stack, so saving the callstack isn't necessary, but it does seem to require getting access to mutable globals and other internal state of the wasm instance that isn't exported. I don't believe wasmtime provides a way of probing instances in ways that their contracts shouldn't allow. Is there a way around this without forking?</p>",
