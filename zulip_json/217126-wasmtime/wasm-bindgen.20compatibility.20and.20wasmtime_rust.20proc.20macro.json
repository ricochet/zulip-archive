Assuming the aforementioned procedural macro is no longer available, would there be an interest  in such macro, that would generate bindings for wasm-bindgen compatible types?</p>",

Dealing with strings is very tricky in general, but the shape of what you'll probably want to do is to arrange for an ABI like you've specified and also export an alloc/free function from the mdoule</p>",
