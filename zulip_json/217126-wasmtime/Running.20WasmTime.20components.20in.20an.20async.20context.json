The reason is I want to be able to create a large number of instances and use as little resources as possible, thus avoid overhead of threads. It works great so far, but I wanted to decrease the amount of plumbing between the host and guest functions and implement WASI components. Is there any way to run WASI components in an async context? Note that I'm not talking about using async inside the modules, just executing the functions exported by WASM components in an async context.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253994\">@Alex Crichton</span> sure, I'll take a look! the <code>bindgen!</code> documentation definitely has that option, it's just that when looking at examples I always saw <code>bindgen!(\"foo\" in \"foo.wit\")</code> and I honestly haven't thought about looking up if any other syntax exists. It's a silly mistake, but I guess if it happened to me, it might happen to others too. I will also try to create an example with WASI cause, at least for me, it was not 100% apparent how to add WASI bindings to the linker. There is so many <code>add_to_linker</code> methods that it takes a bit of time to find the right one. During the weekend I was switching my library to WASI components and for example this change was not obvious to me:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Diff\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gd\">-        wasmtime_wasi::preview1::add_to_linker_async(&amp;mut linker, |t| &amp;mut t.preview2_ctx)?;</span>\n<span class=\"gi\">+        wasmtime_wasi::add_to_linker_async(&amp;mut linker)?;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In any case, I'll try to come up with some more examples that should make sense some time this week</p>",
