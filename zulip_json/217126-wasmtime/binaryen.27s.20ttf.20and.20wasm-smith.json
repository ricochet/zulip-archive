I think it's good to have multiple fuzzers but the downsides right now are that binaryen-sys is largely unmaintained (we can probably ping pepyakin for a publish but all the maintenance would be on us for a crate we don't own) so we're not picking up any new bugfixes or anything like that, and there's a number of fuzz bugs which are timing out in binaryen's generation of the module itself</p>",
