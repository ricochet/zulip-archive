My understanding of <a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/cli-logging.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/cli-logging.html</a> is that I should do <code>RUST_LOG=wasi_common=trace</code>, but neither that nor <code>RUST_LOG=trace</code> appear to do anything.</p>\n<p>Tested this on wasmtime 20.0.2, installed from both Arch and Nix and with and without <code>-D logging=yes</code>.</p>",
