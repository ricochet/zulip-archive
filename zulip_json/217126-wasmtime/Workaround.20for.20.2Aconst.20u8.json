A host function cannot (currently) accept pointers for parameter types because a wasm module can't pass a valid pointer directly to the host.  A wasm module can't know the physical addresses of its own memory, only offsets from the wasm memories it references.  However, a host function can accept an offset and length pair as parameters that can be used, along with the <code>Memory</code> being referenced by the wasm module, to locate the actual physical location of the data and its extent.</p>",

I am trying to access the module memory from the host, but it seems that it is only possible with exported memory only. In the examples, I see that the <code>wat</code> modules are defined by hand and there one could specify the export statement. Is there  a way to do it by writing a module in rust?</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253989\">@Peter Huene</span> yeah, missed that point in the docs. But then again, for the memory to contain some data, the module needs to have a <code>data</code> field, is that correct? (e.g., <code>(data (i32.const &lt;offset&gt;) &lt;data&gt;)</code>). Is there a way to specify from a rust module that it should add the data to the memory so that when it gets compiled it is reachable from the host? (It is clear how to do it in a hand written <code>wat</code> file, but not really when writing a rust module.</p>",
