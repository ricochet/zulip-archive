        "content": "<p>I have a <code>repr(C)</code> struct in my guest Wasm module written in Rust. Right now I'm using serde to serialize the struct to JSON and have it <code>into_boxed_slice</code>. I then use a callback ffi function to pass the pointer and length to the host. This all works, but I'm trying to make it work without having to serialize the struct.</p>\n<p>On the guest I'm now doing <code>Box::into_raw(Box::new(my_struct))</code> and pass that pointer <code>as i32</code> to the host. Now I'm having issues getting this ptr back into my struct with <code>Box::from_raw</code>. I'm not sure how to get to the right offset in memory. I have a ptr to the start of the wasm memory using wasmtime's <code>data_ptr()</code>, but I've tried different things to use my <code>i32</code> ptr value and combine that with <code>data_ptr()</code> to go to the right offset, and then cast it back to my struct, unsuccessfully.</p>\n<p>I feel like I'm missing a crucial piece of the puzzle here, so if anyone has any <em>pointers</em>, I'd be happy to hear them!</p>",
