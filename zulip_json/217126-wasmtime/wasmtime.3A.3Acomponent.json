I'm able to produce the rust guest code with <code>wit_bindgen_guest_rust::generate!</code>, but the wasmtime macro (from V5.0.0) give me the following error:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">expected</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">`</span><span class=\"n\">default</span><span class=\"err\">`</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">`</span><span class=\"n\">world</span><span class=\"err\">`</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">or</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">`</span><span class=\"n\">interface</span><span class=\"err\">`</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">found</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">keyword</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">`</span><span class=\"n\">default</span><span class=\"err\">`</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Should I be using another version of wasmtime?</p>",
