I have a simple async executor that just polls a list of futures in my guest, but those futures can panic, and I'd like to catch the panic and handle it gracefully (e.g. unschedule the future, print some reporting on the host, continue execution with the other futures.)</p>\n<p>I know that wasm32-unknown-unknown defines panic=abort, and I was hoping that this wasn't the case for wasm32-wasi, but it appears to be (<code>catch_unwind</code> doesn't do anything, and the guest still aborts.) Is there a way around this? I'd settle for having limited / no unwind functionality - the main thing I want is to be able to unschedule the future, so to remove it from the list.</p>\n<p>I <em>think</em> this might be doable with a panic hook that does something gnarly with mutable state, but I'm not sure, and I also don't want to rely on any incidental behaviour. What would be the best way to handle this?</p>\n<p>My executor is basically just this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">process</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">futures</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">retain_mut</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">as_mut</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"n\">poll</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Context</span>::<span class=\"n\">from_waker</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">waker</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">==</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Poll</span>::<span class=\"n\">Pending</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>where the <code>poll</code> can panic from the user code.</p>",

I work on <a href=\"https://www.dims.co/\">https://www.dims.co/</a> - we're a collaborative open-world game builder/engine in Rust - and I'm building a Wasm-based scripting interface with Rust as a guest, so that you can build gameplay and other features with your friends and iterate quickly. I'm actually planning on writing a post on the company blog about how the scripting works in the next few weeks - are there any specific questions you want/would want answered?</p>\n<p>(We were previously using Lua, because I know that's a decent game scripting solution, but we're targeting Wasm now because a) Lua is very hard to make robust (which I can attest from prior experience) and b) it opens up opportunities for other languages (currently interested in TinyGo, Kotlin, and Grain))</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://www.dims.co/\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/6eafd8e2723afe4160ae02ca3b4e452c295dbf2a\\/68747470733a2f2f7374617469632e7769787374617469632e636f6d2f6d656469612f3539336636355f39396134346536393437646334313765616431393831323036613134656439327e6d76322e706e672f76312f66696c6c2f775f323530302c685f313430362c616c5f632f3539336636355f39396134346536393437646334313765616431393831323036613134656439327e6d76322e706e67)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://www.dims.co/\" title=\"Dims | Create Open World Games\">Dims | Create Open World Games</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Dims.co is a UGC platform where you create open world games with your friends in realtime.</div></div></div>",
