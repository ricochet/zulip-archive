The gh-pages branch will eventually just want the build output, but I figured it's easier to edit the Markdown source. A couple notes and caveats: my roots in the ecosystem are nowhere near as deep as y'all's, so please hack this up and correct whatever is off! I took a lot from Pat and Bailey's notes...on the whole I think this should be friendly-but-coolheaded documentation, but I really liked the bold big picture quality of some of their language and tried to keep that energy in the intro. Look forward to everyone's feedback.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi.dev/pull/21\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/23e17e20a239daeccf9aeca649eb2c9aab8aa38c\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f663530633636633362303039343061363632616234363562613631353337383839613639353536306565346563633039653238336535656439346562386530302f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f776173692e6465762f70756c6c2f3231)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi.dev/pull/21\" title=\"March 2024 site revamp by ericgregory · Pull Request #21 · bytecodealliance/wasi.dev\">March 2024 site revamp by ericgregory · Pull Request #21 · bytecodealliance/wasi.dev</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Proposed site revamp for WASI.dev.</div></div></div>",
