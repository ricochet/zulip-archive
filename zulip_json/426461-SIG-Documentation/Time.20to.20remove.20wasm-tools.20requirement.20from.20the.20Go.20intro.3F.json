However, there's a link to a PR that's supposed to do away with this step, and that PR has been merged a few months ago. Does that mean that this step is no longer needed?</p>",

So for composition scenarios, we want to use <code>wac</code>; however, wasm-tools is still needed to convert from core module to component, which are steps in both the Go and C guides. Go tooling has improved and I believe we might be able to produce components directly from the go toolchain now and remove use of wasm-tools. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"646597\">@Rajat Jindal</span> do you know if this is the case from your investigation on updating the Go docs?</p>",
