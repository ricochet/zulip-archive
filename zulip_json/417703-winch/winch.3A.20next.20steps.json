In terms of next steps it'd be great to finalize support for SIMD/Relaxed SIMD, which I think it's where the bulk of the work is at the moment in terms of proposals to support. So if you're up for it, that could be a good next step (I'd recommend checking out <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8093\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8093</a> to coordinate instructions if this is something that you're interested in). Another approach could be to work on tail calls for x64, which will take winch-x64 one step closer to <a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-tiers.html#tier-1\">tier-1</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8093\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/30bfe982ffa58437afa17893027d01ae6abab0ca/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f363661323833636339386337353136353464613866366464396532353637343439646362393531383865303361383735326263306562376164353633633164392f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652f6973737565732f38303933&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8093\" title=\"winch(x64): SIMD · Issue #8093 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">winch(x64): SIMD · Issue #8093 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Winch is missing support for most of finished WebAssembly proposals.
