I see an opportunity here to get ahead of that.</p>\n<p><span aria-label=\"sparkling heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f496\" role=\"img\" title=\"sparkling heart\">:sparkling_heart:</span></p>",

WasmFX is one of two proposals under consideration in the stack-switching subgroup of the WebAssembly CG, and is being prototyped/implemented in wasmtime and the tools around it by the people driving the proposal itself</p>",
