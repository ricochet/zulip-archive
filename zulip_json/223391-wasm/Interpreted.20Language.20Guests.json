The group will attempt to achieve this by bringing together different interpreted language guest projects, identifying common foundational issues faced by those projects, and coordinating work on common tooling and solutions.</p>\n<p>The group will maintain lists of dynamic language guest projects, common foundational issues, implementation patterns, and common tools. The group will not be responsible for identified projects or tools but will act as a place for people to discover and collaborate on them and raise feedback to the Bytecode Alliance and its TSC .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I haven't already messaged you and you'd like to be added please reply here or message me.<br>\nFrom my reading of the charter and governance documents, the only requirement is that you support the creation of the group.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The following individuals support the creation of $SIG_NAME:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/161c2ff494171b58df69292bd45845f1b626a77a/templates/SIGs/proposal.md\">SIG proposal template</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any member of the Bytecode Alliance can propose the creation of an Interest Group. Proposals should be made in writing, clearly identify the scope and goals of the IG, and list the member(s) supporting its creation.<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/main/TSC/charter.md#creating-an-interest-group\">TSC charter</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Any specific feedback/tweeks to the group charter can be addressed in the PR feedback.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
