        "content": "<p>Hey! I hope this is the right place, apols if not. From late last year to sorta mid this year I worked on an experimental language that compiles down to WASM. The result of that is a tiny compiler at about the same conceptual level as C.  I even ported Doug Lee's malloc into it (but I will not lie, I have hardly tested the port at all so it probably has many bugs). It has you know generics and linker support and some other things, but honestly it's not much more than a toy.</p>\n<p>I showed it to some people who asked me where I was going with it, and I didn't know; so I put together a whitepaper that I think describes where it should go, which is a much higher level language than C. Based on what I built, I am fairly sure that everything in the whitepaper is buildable right now, <em>except</em> that it relies on a garbage collector which the prototype does not (using malloc as it does).</p>\n<p>So I am looking for feedback, really, primarily on the whitepaper <a href=\"https://github.com/theidiotmachine/WA1/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.MD\">here</a> but if you are curious the <a href=\"https://github.com/theidiotmachine/WA1\">full repo</a> contains the thing I built, including the <a href=\"https://github.com/theidiotmachine/WA1/blob/master/std-lib/mem/src/malloc.wa1\">malloc port</a>. (This was my first Rust project so the code is probably janky as heck - sorry if it grinds your gears). Thanks for taking the time to read this!</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/theidiotmachine/WA1/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.MD\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13615329?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/theidiotmachine/WA1/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.MD\" title=\"theidiotmachine/WA1\">theidiotmachine/WA1</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Hobby WASM compiler project that has gotten out of control, send help - theidiotmachine/WA1</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/theidiotmachine/WA1\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13615329?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/theidiotmachine/WA1\" title=\"theidiotmachine/WA1\">theidiotmachine/WA1</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Hobby WASM compiler project that has gotten out of control, send help - theidiotmachine/WA1</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/theidiotmachine/WA1/blob/master/std-lib/mem/src/malloc.wa1\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13615329?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/theidiotmachine/WA1/blob/master/std-lib/mem/src/malloc.wa1\" title=\"theidiotmachine/WA1\">theidiotmachine/WA1</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Hobby WASM compiler project that has gotten out of control, send help - theidiotmachine/WA1</div></div></div>",
