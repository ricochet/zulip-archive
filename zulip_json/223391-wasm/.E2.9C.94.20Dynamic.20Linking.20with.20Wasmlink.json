Having proved that this approach works, I'm wondering if  (i) there's any other tool (that I might have missed) that provides a similar functionality as the one described (ii) if not, if there's any interest in adding this functionality to the upstream implementation of Wasmlink.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/saulecabrera/wit-bindgen/commit/1c91d84ab5e7bcaab26c45c99d49da3665a4aa1c\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/516b53d346e56d0ff920605b0a109fab961a6c76\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f303836643266663731326336653638396361336464303335666433666261626132343863616137353536383664346238373830303036316163373636656465632f7361756c65636162726572612f7769742d62696e6467656e2f636f6d6d69742f31633931643834616235653762636161623236633435633939643439646133363635613461613163)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/saulecabrera/wit-bindgen/commit/1c91d84ab5e7bcaab26c45c99d49da3665a4aa1c\" title=\"Dynamically link modules (PoC) · saulecabrera/wit-bindgen@1c91d84\">Dynamically link modules (PoC) · saulecabrera/wit-bindgen@1c91d84</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">A language binding generator for WebAssembly interface types - Dynamically link modules (PoC) · saulecabrera/wit-bindgen@1c91d84</div></div></div>",

With the upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model\">component model proposal</a>, I've been expecting <code>wasmlink</code> to no longer be necessary or be completely re-implemented as part of other tooling. When runtimes like wasmtime implement support for the component model, they should be able to JIT/AOT compile adapter code when linking together components. <code>wasmlink</code> was designed to generate core modules from other core modules that implement the canonical interface types ABI and that was done to get a semblance of \"components\" without any support from the runtimes for interface types.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/08f70fab615bdf68084cfaa5c56c629545877330\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f616130626666626165373534383136316135323963353131313063306231343637306534656365363335303032373263306663653964373161323162366562652f576562417373656d626c792f636f6d706f6e656e742d6d6f64656c)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model\" title=\"GitHub - WebAssembly/component-model: Repository for design and specification of the Component Model\">GitHub - WebAssembly/component-model: Repository for design and specification of the Component Model</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Repository for design and specification of the Component Model - GitHub - WebAssembly/component-model: Repository for design and specification of the Component Model</div></div></div>",

The advantage of this approach is that it benefits use-cases that rely on module linking and that want to have a semblance of components through core modules while the proposal is fully implemented in Wasmtime.</p>",
