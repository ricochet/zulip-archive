Basically there are some common shuffle patterns which map to single instructions on x64 and aarch64 which are far more perfomant than the fallback lowering of handling an arbitrary shuffle. </p>\n<p>I saw your comments that what's implemented in Cranelift matches what v8 does but it might be worth going through the RISC-V instruction set to see if there are shuffle-like instructions which can be pattern matched in the same way as aarhc64 and x64. IIRC v8 represents each specialized shuffle as a distinct opcode so it may not all show up in the same place in the backend. I also don't know if RISC-V has specialized instructions myself, but I figured I'd bring this up if you were curious to look into it</p>",
