This is a rollup of the ~4 months of work on the <code>arm64</code> side-branch (excluding the incomplete x64 backend).

I am of course happy to review stuff.<br>\nSomewhat related question: what is now the situation regarding further commits to your branch?  I ask because as I work to speed up the register allocator, I am beginning to see inefficiencies on the CL side (in the new code) that also need to be fixed.  I could make patches for those and put them off to one side until after reviewing/merging is done, if that would be helpful.</p>",
