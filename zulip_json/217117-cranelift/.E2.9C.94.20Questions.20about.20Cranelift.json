        "content": "<p>Hello, I have being writing a blog post about compiling brainfuck with cranelift (<a href=\"https://github.com/Rodrigodd/Rodrigodd.github.io/blob/bf-compiler-part3/_posts/2022-11-21-bf_compiler-part3.md\">here is a draft</a>), and some questions arose as I was writing it. Most of them are issues with the documentation, I think.</p>\n<h2>What exactly is an Extended Basic Block?</h2>\n<p>This appears to be a Cranelift unique extension the concept of Basic Blocks. The extensions appear to be that blocks have parameters (instead of phi functions, as I have seen on LLVM IR, as I read bits of the kaleidoscope tutorial), and instead of using branches with two targets, EBB allows branches to falltrought to the next instruction.</p>\n<p>Also, from what I tested, only a single branch is allowed before a terminator instruction (could be wrong), but documentation (at <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/ir.md#glossary\">docs/ir.md</a> at least) don't make this clear.</p>\n<h2>Why are <code>FunctionBuilder</code> and <code>FunctionBuilderContext</code> split?</h2>\n<p>I presume that is because <code>FunctionBuilder</code> can only be used for a single function, as it is said on its <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-frontend/0.89.2/cranelift_frontend/struct.FunctionBuilder.html\">struct docs</a>. But <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-frontend/0.89.2/cranelift_frontend/struct.FunctionBuilder.html#method.finalize\"><code>FunctionBuilder::finalize</code></a> says that it is reset for the next function compilation.</p>\n<p>Also, <code>func</code> in <code>FunctionBuilder</code> is public. What happens if I replace the function mid-building? This can be used for switching to the next function after calling <code>finalize</code>?</p>\n<h2>The entry block of a function must inherit the parameters of the function?</h2>\n<p>The docs for this <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-frontend/0.89.2/cranelift_frontend/struct.FunctionBuilder.html#method.finalize\"><code>impl FunctionBuilder</code></a> (almost missed it because it in a <code>impl</code>) says that the first <code>switch_to_block</code> defines the entry block, but there is also a separated function <code>append_block_params_for_function_params</code> to add the functions parameters to a block. There are cases where the entry block don't receive the functions parameters? Or cases when I have multiple blocks with the function parameters?</p>\n<p>There is also a <code>append_block_params_for_functions_returns</code>. In what cases this is used?</p>\n<h2>Why in <code>InstBuilder</code> there are a bunch of instructions in PascalCase there?</h2>\n<p>They appear to receive a <code>OpCode</code> as parameter, but not all opcode appear to make sense to each instruction. Looking around, the methods in snake_case appear to be nice wrapping around them, but why the PascalCase ones are exposed under the same struct?</p>\n<h2>Why exactly we must seal the blocks as early as possible?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-frontend/0.89.2/cranelift_frontend/struct.FunctionBuilder.html#method.seal_all_blocks\"><code>FunctionBuilder::seal_all_blocks</code></a> says that is more efficient to call <code>seal_blocks</code> as soon as possible. But how soon this need to be to make a difference? Before switching to another block, before creating another block, before using a Variable, or before emitting the next instructions?</p>\n<p>And why this makes a difference?</p>\n<p>Also, if you only read the docs for <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-frontend/0.89.2/cranelift_frontend/struct.FunctionBuilder.html#method.seal_block\"><code>FunctionBuilder::seal_blocks</code></a>, it suggests that the block <em>must</em> be sealed after the last branch instructions to the block, or there will be inconsistencies.</p>\n<h2>How do I am supposed to get the bytes of the compiled code?</h2>\n<p>I am using <code>CompiledCodeBase::code_buffer</code>, it is a public method, but it is inside a non-public module, so it is not displayed on docs, I don't know if I should be using it. Its type alias, <code>CompiledCode</code>, is public visible, so maybe it is only an issue in how docs are not displaying the methods?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/Rodrigodd/Rodrigodd.github.io/blob/bf-compiler-part3/_posts/2022-11-21-bf_compiler-part3.md\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/c5e5580e3515917243c9c0f86fec5c28ed0528e5\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f393032343431393831613862303534306532623538303431396534363036626636323864313438633439363461383334326335616236343833393039373033332f526f647269676f64642f526f647269676f64642e6769746875622e696f)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/Rodrigodd/Rodrigodd.github.io/blob/bf-compiler-part3/_posts/2022-11-21-bf_compiler-part3.md\" title=\"Rodrigodd.github.io/2022-11-21-bf_compiler-part3.md at bf-compiler-part3 · Rodrigodd/Rodrigodd.github.io\">Rodrigodd.github.io/2022-11-21-bf_compiler-part3.md at bf-compiler-part3 · Rodrigodd/Rodrigodd.github.io</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Contribute to Rodrigodd/Rodrigodd.github.io development by creating an account on GitHub.</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/ir.md#glossary\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/12fec3b4b7218f9cecf09f56694c14515e93064f\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f353936313461383935663262613933643364393335386239306338326430313561393733666337363530333931663130323864353162373262636234633939382f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d65)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/ir.md#glossary\" title=\"wasmtime/ir.md at main · bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">wasmtime/ir.md at main · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">A fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly.

First off, we don't actually use EBBs any more; what Cranelift is doing now is properly called just a \"basic block\". A classical EBB is a single-entrance, multiple-exit block, or in other words, allows branches in the middle of the block out to someplace else. We used to use this abstraction, but we don't any more. The fact that blocks end with up to two branches (a conditional branch and an uncond one) is an artifact of this historical approach and we're working on removing it (by having a two-target conditional branch instead).</p>\n<p>Block parameters are an orthogonal design decision, and in fact there are other compilers (e.g. MLIR in LLVM) that use them in basic blocks too</p>",

    {
        "content": "<blockquote>\n<p>Why exactly we must seal the blocks as early as possible?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This has to do with the algorithm that we use to build SSA (i.e., add block parameters for locals that are defined more than once). If a block is not yet sealed, then more predecessors may be added in the future, and so we can't do anything to resolve all of a local's definitions except insert a placeholder blockparam. We may remove it later if it turns out all preds had the same definition for the local, but this takes work. Instead if we know for sure that no more preds will be added, we can do this optimization (only a single def exists, use it directly) eagerly.</p>",

        "content": "<blockquote>\n<p>Why are <code>FunctionBuilder</code> and <code>FunctionBuilderContext</code> split?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a great question. Probably either <code>FunctionBuilder::finalize</code> should consume <code>self</code>, so the caller has to construct a new <code>FunctionBuilder</code> to build another function, or else the two structs should be merged. Either way allows reusing memory across functions.</p>\n<p>It's important that <code>FunctionBuilder::func</code> is public, because callers may need to access or manipulate it in the middle of using a <code>FunctionBuilder</code>. But I suspect only bad things will happen if you overwrite that field mid-way through a function, so maybe it should be an accessor function instead of a public field.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to try fixing these issues, I think they should be good ones to work on even if you don't know much about the rest of Cranelift.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The docs for this <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-frontend/0.89.2/cranelift_frontend/struct.FunctionBuilder.html#method.finalize\"><code>impl FunctionBuilder</code></a> (almost missed it because it in a <code>impl</code>) says that the first <code>switch_to_block</code> defines the entry block, but there is also a separated function <code>append_block_params_for_function_params</code> to add the functions parameters to a block.

Or cases when I have multiple blocks with the function parameters?</p>\n<p>There is also a <code>append_block_params_for_functions_returns</code>. In what cases this is used?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think the best example for how these two functions are currently used is <code>cranelift/wasm/src/func_translator.rs</code>. But the best answer to your question is that I don't think there's a good reason they're designed that way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why in <code>InstBuilder</code> there are a bunch of instructions in PascalCase there?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those methods are for what we refer to as instruction \"formats\", rather than individual instructions. As you've noticed, each opcode is only used with one instruction format, but some formats are used for many different opcodes. In general I think you should probably ignore the instruction formats unless you're working on Cranelift itself. Maybe that means we should not expose them publicly, but I haven't thought that hard about that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am using <code>CompiledCodeBase::code_buffer</code>, it is a public method, but it is inside a non-public module, so it is not displayed on docs, I don't know if I should be using it.

I'm not sure what the best way to fix it is but those ought to be in the documentation.</p>",
