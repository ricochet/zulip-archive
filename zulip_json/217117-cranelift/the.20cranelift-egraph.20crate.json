I found the <code>cranelift-egraph</code> crate, then looked at the API exposed and went \"hold on, there's no way this is sound\", and while getting ready to report a bug, I noticed that the crate got refactored out of existence, and the <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/cranelift-egraph\">version on crates.io</a> is just a stale snapshot from a while ago. Not ideal, but not sure what the best thing to do about it would be...</p>",
