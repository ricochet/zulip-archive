        "content": "<p>Hello, I am implementing a JIT application and I found an issue with MemFlags's endianness field being ignored on x86_64 and aarch64. I see this has been discovered before in #3625, but no fix has been made. I would like to take a crack at fixing this, but I am not familiar with Cranelift's architecture. After a quick peek I see that the raw instructions are emitted in (for example) <code>codegen/src/isa/aarch64/inst/emit.rs</code>. I guess a trivial fix would be to emit a <code>rev</code> instruction there after the load, based on the endianness of the ISA and flags. However, this would mean non optimal in cases like <code>load rx, be ptr_a; store be ptr_b, rx</code> (the byte swaps cancel each other out). I see a relevant bswap instruction got added in #5147, so perhaps somewhere higher level I should emit those so they can later be optimised out. Where would be the relevant place to do it, and is this the correct approach in the first place?</p>",

Using it slightly lowers the instruction decode cost, but it's not part of the base instruction set. Intel has had it since Haswell, AMD since Excavator. What is the policy with using such an instruction?</p>",

Emitting byteswap instructions immediately after loads is a perfectly reasonable first implementation; we can introduce optimizations later to rewrite swapped-store-of-swapped-load and byteswap-of-swapped-load</p>",
