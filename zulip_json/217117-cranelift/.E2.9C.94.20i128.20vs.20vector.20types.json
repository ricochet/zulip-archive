        "content": "<p>I was wondering to which degree cranelift treats <code>i128</code> and the <code>IiXj</code> types differently. For example, I've noticed that cranelift refuses to use the former in parameter/return types, unless <code>enable_llvm_abi_extensions</code> is set (which seems to be incompatible with how wasmtime wants to use cranelift). Does the choice between the two kinds of types actually affect the generated code, such as the registers used, how they are passed as parameter/return values (assuming the setting I mentioned earlier is enabled), etc? Of course there is a difference between the CLIF instructions that can actually operate on these types.<br>\nPart of the reason I'm asking is that I ran into a problem where <code>bitcast</code>-ing a <code>v128</code> to <code>I64X2</code> caused a panic during lowering, despite the CLIF verifier being happy with the <code>bitcast</code>.</p>",

In most architectures vectors will be stored in vector registers, and not in integer registers. <code>i128</code>'s will usually be stored in two 64 bit registers instead of vector registers.</p>\n<p>There are also abi concerns, that dictate how these two values are passed.
