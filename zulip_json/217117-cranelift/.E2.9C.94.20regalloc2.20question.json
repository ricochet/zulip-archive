In other words, the mapping from \"value\" to \"register\" is at a higher semantic level, and by the time code reaches the register allocator, it is purely operating on registers only</p>",

I suppose i can allocate the entire register and then just use the size i need of it. I'm writing my own little IR that works closely with x86 semantics. I am re-register allocating already compiled functions. The algorithm/framework should still work for me i will just make a MachineEnv with the full width registers and then when the algorithm allocates for me i will just use the width of the register i need.</p>",
