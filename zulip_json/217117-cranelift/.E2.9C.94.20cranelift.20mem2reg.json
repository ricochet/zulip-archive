If a pointer to the stack value exists, then we can't convert it into a reg. If escape analysis proves that no pointer ever is taken, then we can skip the store to memory. LLVM does this, and Cranelift would have to do this if it removed stores. Right now our alias analysis-based optimizations remove loads, but never stores, so the value always actually exists on the stack</p>",
