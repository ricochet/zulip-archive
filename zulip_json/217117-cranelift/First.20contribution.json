        "content": "<p>Hi Vinayak! Welcome :)</p>\n<p>I think contributing to Winch and/or Pulley could be a great on-ramp for you. Winch is our baseline/single-pass Wasm compiler that trades better compile time for worse codegen. Pulley is our portable, optimizing interpreter that ultimately aims to let you take Wasmtime anywhere that the Rust compiler can target, even if we don't have a Cranelift or Winch backend for that architecture (e.g. we don't have backends for riscv32 or esp32 currently, but <code>rustc</code> can target those architectures, so with Pulley we would still be able to run Wasm on them)</p>\n<p>More context/overview/motivation in the RFCs that introduced Winch and Pulley:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/wasmtime-baseline-compilation.md\">Winch RFC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/pulley.md\">Puley RFC</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this time, Winch is fairly complete for x86 but aarch64 is still a WIP. No one has started on riscv64 or s390x yet (which are the two other backends that Cranelift currently supports but Winch does not yet). Check out the <code>winch</code> subdirectory of the repository. I'd suggest perhaps finding a Wasm instruction that isn't implemented on aarch64 yet and putting up a PR to implement it. Example of doing this kind of thing: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9033\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9033</a></p>\n<p>Another possibility (probably better for a second/third/fourth PR once you've got into the swing of things) could be implementing a Wasm proposal for Winch that isn't supported yet, such as Wasm reference types, SIMD, GC, etc...</p>\n<p>+cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"411395\">@SaÃºl Cabrera</span>, who is the lead for Winch</p>\n<p>As for Pulley, it is very much more of a WIP at the moment. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253994\">@Alex Crichton</span> has a few PRs in flight right now that I need to review and merge, but locally has all the infra for running all the Wasm spec test suite, so once all that lands, we just need to bang out all the instruction implementations. This involves basically defining any new pulley bytecode instructions (Pulley has its own bytecode and does not interpret Wasm directly; see RFC for more details) that might be needed, adding support to Cranelift's Pulley backend for emitting those instructions (hooking up encoding support and defining CLIF-to-Pulley-bytecode lowering patterns), and adding tests as necessary. See the <code>pulley</code> and <code>cranelift/codegen/src/isa/pulley-shared/</code> directories for more details here. If you're interested in Pulley, I can also follow up once the in-flight work lands and this effort really opens up as far as parallel work items goes.</p>\n<p>Does all that make sense? What follow up questions do you have?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9033\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/9f47ddbdcf4e9f0877700a2bc988bb3a88b06f82/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f616663646132646363616662343432346332623933326535633837316535643664636438303438343736323564343030356266343064633436366365313161322f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652f70756c6c2f39303333&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9033\" title=\"Winch aarch64 clz &amp; ctz by vulc41n Â· Pull Request #9033 Â· bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">Winch aarch64 clz &amp; ctz by vulc41n Â· Pull Request #9033 Â· bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Hey ðŸ‘‹\nThis PR implements clz and ctz instructions for winch targeting aarch64.\n#8321</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/wasmtime-baseline-compilation.md\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/49b75d7d59af7bca535bdd12a520e17b7be90afa/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f316434613032396434386462633665363265646635666538396631616136336339633432383031386262363537313865303736373966343335343133633865382f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f72666373&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/wasmtime-baseline-compilation.md\" title=\"rfcs/accepted/wasmtime-baseline-compilation.md at main Â· bytecodealliance/rfcs\">rfcs/accepted/wasmtime-baseline-compilation.md at main Â· bytecodealliance/rfcs</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">RFC process for Bytecode Alliance projects.
