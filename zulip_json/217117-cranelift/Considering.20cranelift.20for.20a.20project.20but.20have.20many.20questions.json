So I'd be thankful to get some answers to the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Incomplete support for i8 and i16?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The support for i8 and i16 arithmetic is incomplete and use could lead to bugs</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/cc1c14ac913be13329e5cfc91c33e053ab722132/cranelift/docs/ir.md?plain=1#L145\">this mentioned in the docs</a>, and don't know if this is still the case, but if it is, in what ways is it incomplete and how would it break?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is ISLE advanced enough for me to implement automatic symbolic differentiation of SSA-form programs within it? Can ISLE work as a standalone/generic program transformation tool, or is it too tied to the way it is currently used in Cranelift?</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How hard would it be to implement a SPIR-V backend for Cranelift, as far as the Cranelift part is concerned? A follow up to that is: how adequate is CLIF for expressing GPU computation?</strong> (I noticed that the max amount of lanes supported is 256 for SIMD vectors)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is support for f16 planned? On this same note, are there plans to do LLVM style arbitrary width integers?</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is there any support for LLVM style coroutine suspension and resumption? Or is the current practice to just defunctionalize everything by hand? Are there plans to add support for this?</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>There doesn’t seem to be any facilities for overflow checks and the like in the IR. Is this due to the lack of exception support?</strong> I know this is already being worked on and if the Roadmap is to be believed it should land in the first half of 2023</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tail-call optimization support is also being worked on by what I saw on GitHub. How is the progress on this?</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sorry about the boatload of questions, but I’d be really happy to get some answers on them.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/cc1c14ac913be13329e5cfc91c33e053ab722132/cranelift/docs/ir.md?plain=1#L145\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/24148f3ecafba90713dea59236ee66f01ce8b1a1\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f653936393064616266303564653330343435623032646531373730633531396466346237373239633566366662663832646635356161623031336430326334362f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d65)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/cc1c14ac913be13329e5cfc91c33e053ab722132/cranelift/docs/ir.md?plain=1#L145\" title=\"wasmtime/ir.md at cc1c14ac913be13329e5cfc91c33e053ab722132 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">wasmtime/ir.md at cc1c14ac913be13329e5cfc91c33e053ab722132 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">A fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly.
