To this end I am interested in the following:<br>\n1) I want to turn on trace logging for verbose compilation. <code>$env:RUST_LOG=\"trace\"</code> enables _some_, but not all. My workaround has been to modify source. What's the proper way?<br>\n2) I want to turn on trace logging for a particular method being compiled. Is this possible? If not, how hard would it be to add this capability?<br>\n3) Same as above, but I want to _compile_ a particular method (say, function 123 in the WASM index space).<br>\n4) More generally, where to look for developer-oriented knobs / environment variables, etc? E. g. where I come (RyuJit), we have this nice file: <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/coreclr/jit/jitconfigvalues.h\">https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/coreclr/jit/jitconfigvalues.h</a>.<br>\n5) Is there a way to make the log _not_ emit prefixes with the names of files/modules? They takes a lot of horizontal space.</p>",
