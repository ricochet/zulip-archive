        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"596118\">@Maja Kądziołka</span> -- it is indeed true that the current way that we have chosen to bind ISLE to the egraphs framework does a step-by-step exhaustive search, as you've described.</p>\n<p>I don't think that this is an inescapable aspect of the design though; first of all, one needs to separate ISLE (the language) from \"Cranelift bindings in ISLE\" (i.e., the external extractors and constructors we've defined). ISLE-the-language is fairly low-level in its matching strategy, in that it will freely evaluate external extractors and try to match LHSes in sequence, subject to merging of rules.</p>\n<p>I suspect one might be able to define a sort of \"DSLeDSL\" (DSL embedded in DSL) where the LHS extractors return a lazily-evaluated \"Match of <code>bor</code> at this enode\" value of sorts, and other etors when given this as a starting point, build upon it. Then you basically have an AST describing a query. There are some plumbing details there around how to yield bound variables properly that would need more thought.</p>\n<p>There may be other ways too. I guess I would reflect back to you: we've built ISLE to fit our needs; what changes do you think it needs to fit yours? If you're willing to build such changes, e.g. as a set of primitive features needed to build up to your solution, or an alternate search mode, or something like that, we'd love to talk more!</p>",

I'll certainly give it some thought, though I'm not sure whether that won't defeat the purpose of ISLE...</p>\n<p>Ultimately to give ISLE the capability of making use of the e-graph fully, you'd need to give it the option to call a constructor within the pattern, when all the variables are known. Of course, when a relevant annotation is present that tells it that this is reasonable to do for this constructor.</p>\n<p>It would probably also be nice to make the distinction between \"I need this node, create it if necessary\" and \"i need a reference to the existing copy of this node, if any\".</p>\n<p>It kinda feels like a third concept, next to constructors and extractors, but also kinda not really? Definitely seems like a big enough change that you wouldn't want to carry it upstream without a use case in cranelift ifself...</p>",

That's a time-space trade-off: it makes matching ~linear in the number of instructions regardless of the complexity of the patterns, but it uses more memory to store the intermediate matches.</p>\n<p>I think your suggestion is interesting because it hadn't occurred to me that doing lookups in the egraph's GVN map is sort of a middle-ground position that re-uses data we're already storing anyway. It still requires exhaustive search over eclasses sometimes, but it sounds like a nice optimization when it applies.</p>\n<p>To get ISLE to do this you'd need to find extractor calls where all operands are equality constraints. I think that's a pattern that's pretty easy to find in the intermediate data structures ISLE uses. I'm less sure how we'd want to express an alternate codegen strategy for this case in the ISLE source language, but it's an interesting idea.</p>",
