Currently I translate source programs to <code>cranelift-jit</code> - I tried to use <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-interpreter/latest/cranelift_interpreter/environment/struct.FunctionStore.html#method.add\">https://docs.rs/cranelift-interpreter/latest/cranelift_interpreter/environment/struct.FunctionStore.html#method.add</a> to add every function from the module, but I couldn't find a convenient way to get an <code>ir::Function</code> from that. Is there a way to convert between the two, or would I need to rewrite the code I use to translate to Cranelift?</p>",
