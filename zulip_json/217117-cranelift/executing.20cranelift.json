There are a number of runtimes whose associated code generators <em>use</em> Cranelift, but Cranelift itself is not a runtime, and the IR is agnostic to a lot of the decisions that a runtime normally makes; so typically you will write software that generates CLIF, and tailor that CLIF to interface with your own runtime</p>",

I guess from my reading that I thought that I good first step might be to target CLIF, but wasn't sure what the best way would be to check that I was generating it correctly.  So are you saying that typically people know that they're generating it correctly by then targeting a specific hardware from their CLIF?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Ah, OK, so I think there's a bit of X-Y problem going on here. At a top level, what you are trying to do is write a Wasm compiler+runtime. You're targeting CLIF, and you want to run that CLIF somehow to see if execution is correct. Is that right?</p>\n<p>To answer the specific question first, folks typically test compilers that target Cranelift IR by compiling to native code, and running some test suite.</p>\n<p>More generally, though, and I think where some of my confusion is coming from: CLIF isn't really intended to be a \"target\" in the same way that Wasm bytecode is. The only real use of CLIF currently is to drive Cranelift to produce machine code for one of our supported targets (x86_64, aarch64, s390x). There <em>is</em> a nascent \"CLIF interpreter\" that supports a few opcodes, but nothing that would really be useful for true testing; it doesn't even really support memory (and it's not clear what it would mean to do so, since CLIF operates at a machine-code-semantics level).</p>\n<p>Moreover, CLIF doesn't define any of the ways to interact with the outside world, etc. A user of Cranelift generates CLIF that specifically accesses data structures, and calls functions, provided by their runtime, whatever that is, in the context of a process running native code.</p>\n<p>Onto the topic of writing a Wasm compiler using Cranelift: it sounds like you are wanting to do it by generating CLIF. That's totally workable; but what you'll need to do is invoke Cranelift to produce machine code, then write a runtime that the machine code interfaces with (in C/C++/Rust or some other natively-compiled language). Or you could use <code>cranelift-wasm</code>, a frontend to the core <code>cranelift-codegen</code> that does the Wasm-to-CLIF translation for you, but with runtime-specific details provided by you. Or ultimately use Wasmtime to run the Wasm. If the goal is learning, the first two do sound like interesting projects, and you have the benefit of the existing Wasmtime+Cranelift stack to compare and test against.</p>\n<p>Hopefully that helps? Happy to explain any of the above more if needed!</p>",
