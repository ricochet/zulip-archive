As such I won't be attending CL meetings or reviewing code or regularly reading messages for 3 months, until Feb 12. I think I clicked the right buttons to at least take myself out of review rotation. For regalloc2 stuff, Trevor can cover as needed I think; for general CL stuff, anyone else here. See y'all next year!</p>",
