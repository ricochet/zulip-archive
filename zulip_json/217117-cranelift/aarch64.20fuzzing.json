        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"421408\">@Sam Parker</span> , it depends on what you mean by \"aarch64 fuzzing\". You may have seen my comment on a rust-fuzz issue about aarch64 support -- I discovered it basically works, and we (in Bytecode Alliance) have an aarch64 machine we can use for various development purposes, so I was using spare cycles on it to run the regalloc fuzzers. But: this is just running some fuzzers that are platform-independent; the \"aarch64\" there is arbitrary in the sense that the machine is just running some deterministic computation (i.e., running the fuzzers on aarch64 doesn't somehow give better confidence in Cranelift targeting aarch64).</p>\n<p>We <em>could</em> run the fuzz targets that actually generate and execute code, e.g. the differential fuzzer that runs CL output and compares to a wasm interpreter. I haven't tried that yet, but it would be interesting!</p>\n<p>The answer to your question also depends on what you mean by \"publicly\". In the oss-fuzz case, there's a list of email addresses (which can be seen in the public oss-fuzz repo) that get fuzzbug reports; if we were to run aarch64-generated-code fuzzing on our aarch64 machine it would just be accessible to whoever is running it. Do you mean some sort of setup where fuzzbugs are reported publicly? Or just \"run fuzzing on the current version of the repo\"? In that case, oss-fuzz support would probably be best as it would be automatic, but I don't know what their plans are.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this has reminded me that it would be useful to actually run the differential fuzzer on aarch64, so I'll try that on our aarch64 server machine soon -- thanks :-)</p>",
