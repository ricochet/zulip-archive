We had a dedicated bool type before, but we had persistent confusion about what the register-level value for <code>true</code> should be (1 or -1) and bugs related to that, and bools were always special, so we shifted to integers instead for any value that needs to be truthy. <code>i1</code> would have some of the same weirdness -- can't store to memory, etc -- so we stuck with existing integer types. The ops that consume a truthy value, like select or brif, actually should accept any integer width (and test val != 0); <code>icmp</code> produces i8 because on x86 SETcc only sets the lower 8 bits of a register (ugh).</p>",
