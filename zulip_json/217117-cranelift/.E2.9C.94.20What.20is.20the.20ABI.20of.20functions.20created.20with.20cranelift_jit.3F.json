        "content": "<p>The JIT demo <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/jit/examples/jit-minimal.rs#L87\">in the official repository</a> transmutes the returned pointer to a rust function type. Wouldn't this mean cranelift's compiler backend produces the same ABI as the rust compiler? (And AFAIK Rust doesn't have a stable ABI.) I would have expected it to produce a Rust <code>extern \"C\"</code> function. I didn't do a thorough search, but I couldn't find documentation on it either. Could someone clarify? Thanks!</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/jit/examples/jit-minimal.rs#L87\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/fe255c5563d9d7e2f2a2a5136cc75c2ddd8ee168\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f366335383333333437623133653635386337343730623765326265333134366131336632616161633366343836623435366661363030623338616263626335302f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d65)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/jit/examples/jit-minimal.rs#L87\" title=\"wasmtime/jit-minimal.rs at main · bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">wasmtime/jit-minimal.rs at main · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">A fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly.
