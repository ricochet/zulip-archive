I tried writing the code myself and when I encountered this error I tried using the exact code from the jit demo for if expression but the exact same issue persisted. Here's the error \"called <code>Result::unwrap()</code> on an <code>Err</code> value: Compilation(Verifier(VerifierErrors([VerifierError { location: block0, context: None, message: \"cfg lacked the following successor(s) [block1, block2]\" }, VerifierError { location: block1, cont<br>\next: None, message: \"cfg lacked the following successor(s) [block1, block2, block3]\" }, VerifierError { location: block2, context: None, message: \"cfg lacked the following successor(s) [block1, block2, block3]\" }, VerifierError { location<br>\n: block3, context: None, message: \"cfg lacked the following successor(s) [block1, block2, block3]\" }])))\". Can anyone provide an explanation or at least point me in the right direction to solve this issue? I'm happy to provide any more information that would be helpful.</p>",
