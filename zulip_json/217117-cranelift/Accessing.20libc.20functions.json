The project already had a JIT mode that uses cranelift_jit, and is capable of importing libc functions by declaring them by name with the import linkage, and that seems to be all. At no point does the compiler explicitly link in any libc functions or libc itself. But while writing a lazy jit backend, which needs hotswap and thus enables PIC (it's normally disabled by the non-lazy JIT) suddenly these functions crash when called, but the crash can be avoided by adding them to the symbol table (or presumably adding a lookup function that can find them). <br>\nWhy does the non-PIC backend not need to import libc functions, and what would be the easiest way to fix this/import the libc functions?</p>",
