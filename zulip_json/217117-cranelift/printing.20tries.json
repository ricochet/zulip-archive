At the moment, no, but I can see how one might be able to map from the trie back to rules; basically enumerate all paths to leaves, recover the LHS (sequence of PatternInst) and get the RHS (sequence of ExprInst) from the leaf, and then decompile the two sequences to ASTs. The last bit is a little tricky in the presence of sharing; we lose some information while lowering from AST to IR ops</p>",

For example, what other rules would be on the path if we try to lower an <code>iadd</code> instruction?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Cool, so to instrument the generated code to emit a trace of the lowering logic, you could add a generated println after this line [1], which is the opening <code>fn f(...) {</code> generated for each constructor term, and possibly iterate over and emit args too. Then here [2] you can see where we emit a comment in the generated code saying where an RHS body came from (file and line); you could add a generated println here too, so the lowering code says something like \"now at lower.isle line 123\".</p>\n<p>Also, as a general note, for targeted tracing/modifications, it should be ok to modify the generated code as well. If you regenerate it you'll lose the changes of course, but regeneration is always an explicit opt-in via Cargo feature. So you could e.g. just add a println at the top of lower(), then dig in from there.</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84/cranelift/isle/isle/src/codegen.rs#L287-L292\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84/cranelift/isle/isle/src/codegen.rs#L287-L292</a><br>\n[2] <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84/cranelift/isle/isle/src/codegen.rs#L674-L680\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84/cranelift/isle/isle/src/codegen.rs#L674-L680</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84/cranelift/isle/isle/src/codegen.rs#L287-L292\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/8de9dcf8c00bf4cce31775b2de75e5748c476c12\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f666265303261323038363036636661383938386237613635646134353239353332373930666334393630663338643432383430633334646236653739646436392f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d65)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84/cranelift/isle/isle/src/codegen.rs#L287-L292\" title=\"wasmtime/codegen.rs at a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">wasmtime/codegen.rs at a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Standalone JIT-style runtime for WebAssembly, using Cranelift - wasmtime/codegen.rs at a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84/cranelift/isle/isle/src/codegen.rs#L674-L680\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/8de9dcf8c00bf4cce31775b2de75e5748c476c12\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f666265303261323038363036636661383938386237613635646134353239353332373930666334393630663338643432383430633334646236653739646436392f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d65)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84/cranelift/isle/isle/src/codegen.rs#L674-L680\" title=\"wasmtime/codegen.rs at a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">wasmtime/codegen.rs at a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Standalone JIT-style runtime for WebAssembly, using Cranelift - wasmtime/codegen.rs at a519e5ab645899fb29017d78b5174ad249fdcf84 · bytecodealliance/wasmtime</div></div></div>",
