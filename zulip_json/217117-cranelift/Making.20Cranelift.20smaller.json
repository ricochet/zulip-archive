This is tolerable for some applications considering that Cranelift is doing such an important job, but is far from ideal. Does anyone have an idea what's making Cranelift so big and how it could be made smaller? I would like to make contributions to make Cranelift smaller and reduce its compilation time, if someone could point out where to get started.</p>",
