        "content": "<p>For my OCaml bytecode JIT I'm using the stackmap support for its GC. It works well but is overly conservative because it inserts a safepoint at every call. For things like the GC write barrier (part of the runtime in C) which gets called fairly often this can slow things down as it tends to spill and restore. The GC will only run during allocations which means a lot of the primitives from the runtime don't need to spill and emit a stackmap but currently do. Inlining the write barrier wouldn't work as it just pushes the issue down to the functions used in the write barrier itself.</p>\n<p>I'd like to somehow have a way to do a call without a safepoint and think it would be a useful thing for the project. I am potentially able to do the work myself (although running out of time to give to this project). However, I'm not sure what the best design would be to represent it in the IR:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have separate call instructions like <code>call_no_safepoint</code> and <code>call_indirect_no_safepoint</code></li>\n<li>\n<p>Represent it in the signature either by<br>\n  a. Having special calling conventions (messy but less work)<br>\n  b. Adding another metadata field - perhaps could become something more general like the LLVM 'gc strategy'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Something else?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For passing this to codegen I think for the old backend it's just a case of extending <code>is_safepoint</code> in <code>inst_predicates.rs</code> but the new backend (which I actually use) looks more involved. As far as I can tell it might be a case of making <code>gen_call</code> return <code>InstIsSafepoint::No</code>for each <code>ABIMachineSpec</code> impl but I haven't looked in to the effects doing this has downstream.</p>\n<p>Which strategy would be best for adding this to the IR? Am I missing any complications in the implementation?</p>",

You're correct that at the moment we simply decide that all callsites are safepoints; this was driven by the original application (in SpiderMonkey) where there was not a guarantee that a hostcall would not GC, in general.</p>\n<p>I do like the idea of an ABI dimension that is \"safepoint call\" or \"no-safepoint call\" (your option 2b); this feels like the cleanest approach. You're correct that this basically means returning a different flag from <code>gen_call</code>; the rest should Just Work. </p>\n<p>I'm happy to review a PR for this if you want to try your hand at it! (I won't be able to get to it for a while otherwise, unfortunately)</p>",
