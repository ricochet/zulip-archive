I don't use egraphs but a forward-dataflow optimization (const-prop, simplification, etc) but the same principle applies. Blockparams are basically multi-input pure operations, the only tricky part is that the input may come from a <em>later</em> instruction in the processing order. The way to handle this is to re-run the pass until a fixed point: every time an branch argument is modified and the branch target has already been processed in the current pass then you need to do run another pass.</p>",
