Is there a way to do this, or is there something obvious I'm missing? I have been looking online and see some people say cdecl == fastcall == stdcall, but I look at the abi docs and they seem to be slightly different, e.g. caller or callee cleans up stack, which I would think should be pretty crucial things. So I'm not sure if I can rely on the advice that \"cdecl == fastcall\".</p>\n<p>What am I missing here?</p>\n<p>Edit: Just to be clear, I'm talking about <code>CallConv</code></p>",
