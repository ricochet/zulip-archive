From there you should be able to feed that into a linker to get a proper executable.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we don't have much documentation for this, but you can see how it is <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/f10d665bb9cacceee6051989e99c0934c542ad84/cranelift/src/compile.rs#L70-L73\">used in <code>clif-util</code></a> which is an internal development tool.</p>\n<p><code>clif-util</code> doesen't do the linking, but you can look at <a href=\"https://github.com/afonso360/saltwater/blob/5ea6c2e221951d0a3ea4e3423f37a6cbdbe2c744/src/main.rs#L162-L181\">this example</a> for how to do that.</p>",
