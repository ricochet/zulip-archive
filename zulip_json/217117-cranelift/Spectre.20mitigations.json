There's a question of whether we also expend effort to build this out for the (legacy) x86 backend; it's a bit nontrivial (but do-able) to do so. The major reason not to is that by default, the x86 backend uses a 4GB guard region (\"huge heap mode\", I think it's called?) so no checks are needed at all; this only matters with non-default options. Is everyone OK with saying that the huge-heap mode is our Spectre-safe option on x86? We plan to also put the mitigations behind a flag that's on by default, and we could perhaps error out if this flag is not explicitly turned off with small-heap / explicit-check x86 variants.</p>",
