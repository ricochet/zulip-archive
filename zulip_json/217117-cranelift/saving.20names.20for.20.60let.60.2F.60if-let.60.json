One hiccup is handling names for <code>let</code> blocks.  Since the bindings are truncated after evaluating the <code>let</code> body (e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/7bfbec1b5732fe3e4560ec1cc26518ceeed472d9/cranelift/isle/isle/src/sema.rs#L2343\">this line</a>), can variable IDs be reused across multiple (non-nested) <code>let</code> blocks? </p>\n<p>Seems like we will need to do our own scoping on the verification side to handle this, which is fine, just wanted to confirm that this is what happens with  the <code>VarId</code> mapping.

I think we should just revert part of the PR and put the <code>next_var</code> field back so that <code>VarId</code>s are unique within a rule.
