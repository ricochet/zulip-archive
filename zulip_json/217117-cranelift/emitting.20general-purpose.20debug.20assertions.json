I've found <code>DEBUG_ASSERT_TRAP_CODE</code> in <code>lib.rs</code> and its users, but there doesn't seem to be a counterpart to something like Rust's <code>debug_assert_eq</code>. Am I overlooking it, is there a good reason why it doesn't exist, or is it just that no need for has come up for it so far?</p>",
