Right now most of what we have is <a href=\"https://cranelift.dev/\">https://cranelift.dev/</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift/docs/\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift/docs/</a>. It would be nice to get closer to Wasmtime's documentation; the source for that is in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/docs/\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/docs/</a> and it uses mdbook. Helping us set up mdbook for Cranelift would be a huge help even if you didn't write any new documentation in the process.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I like the structure you've outlined! It's hard for me to be sure exactly what you have in mind from just section titles but it looks reasonable.</p>\n<p>One thing that occurs to me is that we have two kinds of documentation mixed together currently: docs for people who want to use Cranelift in other projects, and docs for people who want to make changes to Cranelift.</p>\n<p>Something like <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/isle-integration.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/isle-integration.md</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/testing.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/testing.md</a> is not interesting if you just want to use Cranelift, so those should go in a separate section of the book.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/compare-llvm.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/compare-llvm.md</a> is potentially useful to both audiences, so putting it in the introduction (currently section 1.4 of your book) is a good idea. It also is wildly out of date in places, but that's a separate problem…</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/ir.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/docs/ir.md</a> should probably get split into smaller chunks, many of which may help fill out various sections of your draft outline.</p>\n<p>We should figure out how to arrange this material so that we can host the pre-rendered book somewhere. One unfortunate thing about GitHub pages is that as far as I can tell there's no way to serve multiple domains from one repository. The simplest solution is to keep the source for the book in a separate repository, and maybe we should start there; that's how the <a href=\"http://cranelift.dev\">cranelift.dev</a> and <a href=\"http://wasmtime.dev\">wasmtime.dev</a> web sites work. But eventually it would be preferable to have the book source live alongside the Cranelift source so that it's easier to keep it up to date.</p>",

And basically, I was trying to go for a patterm of learning a concept then applying it in code.</p>\n<p>And for the two kinds of documentation, maybe the book should focus on using Cranelift (since that's a majority of the use cases), and we have another book (if possible) to store how to contribute to Cranelift.</p>\n<p>And yeah, I agree. I think we should start out with a seperate repository for it. </p>\n<p>Also, should we start a new topic specifically about the book? I feel like it would be better suited there so more people can see this instead of having to scroll through replies to this topic.</p>",
