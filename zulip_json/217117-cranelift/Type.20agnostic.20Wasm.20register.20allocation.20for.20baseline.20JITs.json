(E.g. at least in <code>wasmi</code> registers fit any 64-bit Wasm type.)</p>\n<p>So ideally we want to allocate registers based on their respective lifetimes instead of type.<br>\nFast compilation requirements disallow SSA based IR.</p>\n<p>Are there  known techniques for dealing with allocation of virtual register slots that are applicable for singlepass JITs or rewriting interpreters optimized for fast compilation? Happy about links or papers or search hints. :)</p>",
