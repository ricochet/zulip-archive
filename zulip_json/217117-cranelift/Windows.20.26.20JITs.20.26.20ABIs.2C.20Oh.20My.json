At the moment, I'm running into a problem that smells like an ABI mismatch somewhere, where it could just be that there's some flag I need to pass to Cranelift to put it in some mode, or there may be some way I need to define the function in Rust to make the jump clean.</p>\n<p>But, the meat of it is: I get a crash well after exiting my JITed code, because some Rust library is doing a write through RSI, and RSI has been clobbered by the Cranelift-generated code. Looking at ABI docs, RSI is used for an argument register in Linux, but looks like it's defined as callee-saved on Windows (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-software-conventions?view=msvc-170#x64-register-usage\">reference</a>). I don't see any generated code to save the register, which is what's making me wonder if there's an ABI mismatch, or possibly a bug in the definition of the register save semantics in Cranelift for Windows.</p>\n<p>Any pointers?</p>\n<p>-Adam</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-software-conventions?view=msvc-170#x64-register-usage\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/3ce17f2b2911dcb735720cc46e75758679339053\\/68747470733a2f2f6c6561726e2e6d6963726f736f66742e636f6d2f656e2d75732f6d656469612f6f70656e2d67726170682d696d6167652e706e67)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-software-conventions?view=msvc-170#x64-register-usage\" title=\"x64 ABI conventions\">x64 ABI conventions</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Learn more about: x64 ABI conventions</div></div></div>",
