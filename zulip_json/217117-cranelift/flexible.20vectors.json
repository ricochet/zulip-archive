I want to begin by adding a 'pass' to do type legalization, enabling the consumption of flexible IR and outputting the equivalent using simd128 so that the current backends can consume it without modification. And now that I've finally spent a day looking at the code, I have quite a few questions!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Would peepmatic support changing the types of the operations, and so handling the whole conversion process?</li>\n<li>Should this be performed in the existing legalize phase?</li>\n<li>Is there somewhere else that we currently do any type legalization?</li>\n<li>What mechanism should be used for the communication of what the backend wants and supports?</li>\n<li>Has anyone got, more concrete, ideas of how to go about  any of this? :)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",

I recognize that this probably creates some difficulties for you if you're hoping to implement something soon-ish! I think the best way to prototype would probably be to look at defining what the CLIF ops for flexible vectors will be (this will be fully reusable work); and then doing a direct lowering in aarch64 for now, leaving the x64 and s390x parts with <code>unimplemented!()</code> stubs. Then we can fill in that last corner later as we get a clearer picture of what legalization should look like.</p>",
