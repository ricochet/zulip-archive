If fuel metering is disabled this optimization would not be applied and thus the max (call) stack depth acts as this finite abstract resource that is consumed for each function call.</p>",

I believe that clang/LLVM will actually do this today when you enable tail calls. ofc the bit about it not always being a beneficial transform still applies.</p>",

        "content": "<p>An additional nuance is, the term \"tail position\" is ambiguous; is a call in tail position if its return value goes through a local.set/local.get? Or an <code>add</code> with 0? And further, on some hardware architectures but not others, operations like <code>i32.wrap_i64</code> can be done implicitly and could be compatible with tail call optimization. And another is that some wasm tools and implementations add instrumentation to the ends of functions, which would interfere with \"tail position\".</p>",

I won't implement this optimization despite the fact that even with this optimization, Wasmi probably would have never seriously outperform any of the JIT based engines such as Wasmtime. :D</p>\n<p>The question when a call is in tail position was very interesting to me. Practically or theoretically minded persons might answer this question very differently.
