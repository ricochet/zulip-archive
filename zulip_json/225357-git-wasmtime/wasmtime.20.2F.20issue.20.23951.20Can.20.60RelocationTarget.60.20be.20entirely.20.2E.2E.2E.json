Unfortunately though <code>RelocationTarget</code> means that we also may have to actually modify the code we map in, which in turn can cause a lot of it to get paged in unnecessarily quickly.</p>\n<p>This issue is intended to track if we can get rid of <code>RelocationTarget</code> entirely, or if it's even desirable. The downsides to this would be that everything currently requiring a relocation would go through some form of indirection instead. The upside however is that we can possibly do zero work when loading code from a cache, making cached instantiation even faster than it is today.</p>\n</blockquote>",
