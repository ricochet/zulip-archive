Tests are configured differently than before using Wasmtime CLI flags rather than a custom TOML-based configuration scheme. Otherwise though the same shape of tests is supported.</p>\n<p>This commit migrates a small handful of tests as a showcase and bulk migration is left for a follow-up.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

For example it feels overly verbose to do:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"wasm\"><pre><span></span><code>;;! flags = [\"-Oopt-level=s\", \"-Ccranelift-has-avx\"]\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>as opposed to:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"wasm\"><pre><span></span><code>;;! flags: -O opt-level=s -C cranelift-has-avx\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I don't necessarily have a great feeling for how extensible we want this to be down the line though. I was sort of also taking inspiration from compiletest-based tests in rust-lang/rust, but I know the parsing there is sort of gnarly nowadays given all the directives it supports.</p>\n</blockquote>",
