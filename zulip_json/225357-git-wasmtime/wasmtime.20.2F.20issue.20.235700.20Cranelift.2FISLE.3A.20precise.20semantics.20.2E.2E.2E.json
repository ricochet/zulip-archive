I think that's what we've been moving toward producing in the mid-end optimization rules.</p>\n<p>But we don't verify that whoever produced the CLIF we're compiling followed that rule, and in that sense we're currently following option 3.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But we are taking something like option \"iii\" in the verifier, which is \"conservative\" in the sense that it at least doesn't mistakenly reject correct rules that adhere to \"i\" or \"ii\". But it also limits it from finding bugs in rules that make incorrect assumptions about out-of-range bits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't understand this. If a backend \"cannot rely on those bits being anything in particular\", then any rule which does rely on those bits (being all-zero in case 1, or all-sign in case 2, or making some other unspecified assumption) should be rejected by the verifier, right?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Elsewhere when we have a variable-width payload we generally try to zero-extend.</p>\n<p>Re: current verifier assumptions: I imagine what's going on here is that the verifier is providing the assumption that the upper bits are initialized (sign-extended? zero-extended?) so rules that assume this invariant will work, but is not checking the same assumption at the output side? I guess a consistent approach at either extreme would be better -- either provide and check the bit status, or leave as don't-care on the input (as @jameysharp suggests) and don't verify on output. Former would be consistent with taking option 1 or 2 I guess.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Its current policy does not _model_ rule semantics under the regime of policy 3; instead, it does the masking/truncation like policy 3 on behalf of the rules. So, in the verifier's world, rules effectively \"see\" narrow values and never even interact with the out-of-range bits. Therefore, according to the verifier, they can never have bugs that arise from treating the out-of-range bits incorrectly. (As ever, @avanhatt may correct me about this.)</p>\n</blockquote>",
