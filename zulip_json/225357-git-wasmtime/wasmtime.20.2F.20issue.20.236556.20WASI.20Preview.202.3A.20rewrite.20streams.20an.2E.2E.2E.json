I am now going to make the windows inherit stdin panic, mark the tests that affects as cfg_attr(windows, should_panic), and land this PR. The follow up work includes, in rough priority order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HostPollable::TableEntry issues around pollables outliving their parent resource, which are a crash vector right now</li>\n<li>get windows stdin working, and better tests of unix asyncfd based stdin</li>\n<li>implementing stream splice and forward, and dealing with the lifetimes of background tasks accordingly</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
