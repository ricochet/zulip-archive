Also add support in the instruction specificaton dsl for marking instructions as <code>raw</code>, which indicates that their generated builder function is not meant to be the primary interface for generating that instruction.</p>\n<p>As an example, port over the <code>jump</code> builder function with an implementation that dispatches directly to the raw <code>jump_</code> builder function. This functionality will greatly simplify landing #5464, where the largest portion of the diff is due to the arguments of the <code>jump</code> builder function changing.<br>\n&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
