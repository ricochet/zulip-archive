I plan on leveraging this in a subsequent commit to #6332 which turns on Stacked Borrows for Wasmtime, but currently it fails due to this transitive dependency of Cranelift, hence the update.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
