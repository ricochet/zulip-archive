This previously didn't work<br>\nbecause trampoline lookup would fail as the original<br>\n<code>VMCallerCheckedAnyfunc</code> function pointer points into the<br>\n<code>trampoline_obj</code> of a component which wasn't registered with the<br>\n<code>ModuleRegistry</code>. This plumbs through the necessary configuration to get<br>\nthat all hooked up.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
