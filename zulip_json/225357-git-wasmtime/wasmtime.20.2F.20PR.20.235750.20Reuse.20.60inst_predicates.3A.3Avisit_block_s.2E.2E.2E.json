As far as I can tell, the order of visiting successors of a single instruction doesn't affect that property, as long as the order is stable if you compute the dominator tree multiple times.</p>\n<p>Looking further at the history, I think a lot of this is remnants from the old \"extended basic block\" model. There's a giant comment in <code>compute_postorder</code>, which is immediately above this function, where as far as I can tell almost none of that comment applies to Cranelift today. Most of that comment was written when this was still called Cretonne.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't be shocked if we don't care about \"split-invariant post-orders\" at all any more. Even if we do, I don't think this change breaks that property. But just in case I'm wrong about both of those, let's see if @cfallin wants to weigh in.</p>\n</blockquote>",
