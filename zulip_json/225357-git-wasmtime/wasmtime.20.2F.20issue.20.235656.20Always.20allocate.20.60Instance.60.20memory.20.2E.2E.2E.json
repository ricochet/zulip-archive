Reusing slots allows memory image reuse possibly, reduction of page faults as memory is already paged in, etc. </p>\n<p>Precisely how the pool is used I think is up to an application. For example an application may want a large pool for a smaller number of maximally concurrent instances to have as many affine slots per module as possible. In such a configuration it may not be expected to have such a large impact on RSS for idle slots doing nothing. </p>\n<p>Overall I personally think it's pretty reasonable to expect that the working set consumed by wasmtime is roughly proportional to the working set of live objects in an embedding. While it's not strictly necessary that we malloc/free the instances here I don't think it necessarily hurts anyone. </p>\n<p>The changes here can have other minor additional benefits such reducing fragmentation overhead since instances are allocated on page-aligned mappings today whereas with this PR they're thrown into the general malloc/free pool to get a better fit.</p>\n</blockquote>",
