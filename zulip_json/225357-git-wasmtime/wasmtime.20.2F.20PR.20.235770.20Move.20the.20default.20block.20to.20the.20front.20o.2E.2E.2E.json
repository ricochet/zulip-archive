Some callers already have a <code>Vec</code> allocated and it's a little annoying to have to allocate a second one to copy into, only for the caller to drop theirs immediately afterward.</p>\n<p>The other alternative is to take <code>table: impl IntoIterator&lt;Item = Block&gt;</code>. That's somewhat appealing for <code>cranelift/wasm/src/code_translator.rs</code> which I think could then avoid allocating a temporary <code>Vec</code>. It also works fine for all the tests since arrays implement the right <code>IntoIterator</code>. Passing in a <code>Vec</code> by-value works too, although like the current approach that still allocates a new <code>Vec</code> and copies into it. However, I think this is a little more magic than necessary. Passing in a slice is fine.</p>\n</blockquote>",
