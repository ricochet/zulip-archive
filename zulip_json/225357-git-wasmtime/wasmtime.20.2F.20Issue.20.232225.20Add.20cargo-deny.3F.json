Some of the advantages it has to offer are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>License check: used to verify that every crate you use has a license term you find acceptable.</li>\n<li>Bans check: used to deny (or allow) specific crates, as well as detect and handle multiple versions of the same crate.</li>\n<li>Advisory check: used to detect issues for crates by looking in an advisory database.</li>\n<li>Sources check: used to ensure crates only come from sources you trust.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At Embark Studios, we've just started making heavy use of wasmtime and, as we are running cargo-deny in our CI, found multiple versions of the same dependency within wasmtime. Specifically, <code>wasmtime-debug</code>, <code>wasmtime-jit</code>, and <code>wasmtime-obj</code> (all version 0.20.0) all have <code>wasmparser</code> <strong>0.59.0</strong> as a dependency but also <code>object</code> 0.21.1, which in turn has <code>wasmparser</code> <strong>0.57.0</strong> as a dependency. </p>\n<p>Multiple versions of the same dependency can cause all sorts of issues so we like to limit this as much as we can! As wasmtime currently isn't running cargo-deny this \"bug\" might have gone by completely unnoticed. If you did notice but had your own reasons not to \"fix\" it, that's absolutely fine as well, just wanted to use this specific issue as an example!</p>\n<p>Let me know what you guys think! Both the advantages and/or disadvantages of using cargo-deny for wasmtime.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In our case, the duplicate dependency \"broke\" the build in CI so I investigated the issue, realized what was going on, and as a result told cargo-deny to <strong>skip</strong> those specific crates.
