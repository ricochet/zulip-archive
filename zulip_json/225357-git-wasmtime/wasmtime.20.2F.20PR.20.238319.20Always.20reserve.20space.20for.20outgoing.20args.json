At a glance, it seems like a pretty sus default to just ignore the requested space! Especially since the dual restore method is <em>not</em> a no-op! I feel like a comment explaining that the space is pre-reserved when the stack frame is pushed, and that restoring the argument area is only used for tail calls in practice since they are otherwise preserved, would be helpful somewhere in this viscinity.</p>\n</blockquote>",

To do that, they need to know how much stack is actually needed for the current call. So we've ensured that _at least_ this much space is available during the prologue, which is why a no-op is okay here, and overriding can arrange that there is _less_ space available if desired. #8327 illustrates roughly how that would work, except that's for return-calls, where this optimization is actually required.</p>\n<p>Yeah, we should write better comments here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
