Unfortunately we only support ARM64 (which would require a 64-bit userland) right now. @brooksmtownsend, I've used wasmtime successfully on a Gentoo 64-bit install on a RPi4, FWIW, but I know switching distro/install is quite a hassle.</p>\n<p>ARM32 support may come at some point in the future, but I'm not sure what our architecture support roadmap looks like so I can't make any promises, sorry!

I think v0.15.0 might indeed be too old: I think the new backend hadn't landed by then, and we certainly didn't do aarch64 builds in CI. We do do that by now, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/dev\"><code>dev</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v0.16.0\"><code>v0.16.0</code></a> releases.</p>\n<p>However, the cross-compilation process isn't documented (at least that I could find). I just filed #1720 to rectify that. Here's the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/d1aa86f91a4e7b6d1663cd9b4a1f749fdbb83dfd#diff-90829e76e906f1c73140c7ded7e1b268\">patch that added aarch64 builds to CI</a>, in case you're interested.</p>\n</blockquote>",
