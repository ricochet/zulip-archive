The general idea here is that this addressing mode encompasses an addition of a host-width value to a zero-extended (optionally) 32-bit value. On 32-bit hosts there's no zero-extension but on 64-bit hosts there's a zero-extension. The wasm address is always 32-bits though which enables using a single instruction for both 32 and 64-bit hosts.</p>\n<p>New \"g32\" loads and stores are added to Pulley with varying sizes and options according to what seems to be common in wasm. The <code>disas</code> test suite was updated to showcase using these instructions for wasm loads/stores on 32 and 64-bit hosts.</p>\n<p>An additional change in this commit is to deduplicate the 32/64-bit bounds-check macro-ops. The trick in this commit works for those as well meaning that only a single instruction is needed instead of one-per-host-pointer-width. Additionally the load of the bound from the <code>VMContext</code> is folded into the bounds check itself as it was found that this was always present anyway before the bounds check.</p>\n<p>Overall this shrinks the size of <code>spidermonkey.cwasm</code> from 21M to 20M and the runtime of <code>pulldown-cmark</code>, <code>bz2</code>, and <code>spidermonkey</code> on Sightglass have all been reduced by 10%. Not as big wins as I was hoping for but alas.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
