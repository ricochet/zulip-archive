It's always been the case that even for Unix you can install your own signal handler as well.</p>\n<p>Could you describe your use case a bit more? Does your use case require Wasmtime to handle traps first and then your application's handler runs next? Can your application register its own signal handler and does that work?</p>\n</blockquote>",

The motivation for PR #2632 makes a lot of sense to me.</p>\n<p>Our use case is the motivation behind PR #620: we use a custom signal handler to keep track of accessed Wasm memory pages. The handler runs before the Wasmtime handler, but we need to run the Wasmtime handler afterwards. What makes it more complex is that there are multiple handlers (one per Wasm instance) and multiple Wasm instances can be running on multiple threads.</p>\n<p>Registering our own signal handler is probably possible in theory, but it is very difficult to get the handler chaining, registration ordering, and Wasm instance tracking per thread right. We would need to mirror what Wasmtime already does internally.</p>\n<p>It would be great if we could find a workaround to unblock updating to the current version of Wasmtime. It's worth mentioning that we don't use Breakpad, so the signal-based trap handling would work well for us on MacOS.</p>\n</blockquote>",
