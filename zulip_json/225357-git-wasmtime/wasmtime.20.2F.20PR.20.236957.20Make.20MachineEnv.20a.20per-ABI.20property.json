This is currently fixed per TargetIsa - however, conceptually these register sets can differ between ABIs on the same ISA.</p>\n<p>To allow for this, replace the TargetIsa machine_env routine with an ABIMachineSpec get_machine_env routine.  To ensure the structure is still only allocated once, cache it via static OnceLock variables.</p>\n<p>No functional change intended.</p>\n<p>FYI @cfallin - this is what I suggested in last week's meeting.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
