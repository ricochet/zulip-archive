This is intended to help increase portability in cases where signal handlers are otherwise difficult. This is achieved by plumbing the translation environment to more locations which now conditionally lowers to calls to a function to raise a trap instead of a trap instruction.</p>\n<p>The caveats of this support are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is not yet implemented for Winch</li>\n<li>This requires disabling spectre mitigations</li>\n<li>This does not yet support shared memories since it forces dynamic memories to be used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These points are all possible to address but it might be best to see how this feature evolves over time. I'll also note that this is not an optimized implementation and likely has a fair bit of overhead. For example the solution in #6926 of a more optimized stub to jump-and-trap is not implemented yet.</p>\n<p>Closes #6926</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

The component side of things is a bit unfortunate because it's only needed for a degenerate case of always-trapping adapters, but I'll probably leave the minor duplication for now in the hopes this can be refactored away in the future</p>\n</blockquote>",

Additionally I think it's always valid to promote, perform an op, then demote. The bad thing is to promote, perform a few ops, then demote. Here though there's no \"demotion\" and it's just promote-and-convert which I believe in theory should.</p>\n<p>The wasm spec tests are actually somewhat comprehensive in the boundary cases here and differential fuzzing is also enabled, so I believe that this is correct.
