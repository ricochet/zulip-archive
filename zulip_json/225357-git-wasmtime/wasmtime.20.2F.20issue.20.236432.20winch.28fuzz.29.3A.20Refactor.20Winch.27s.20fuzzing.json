For the record, this was an oversight from my end, the intention was not to enable Winch by default, so in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6432/commits/7ed113712bb5a6f574e70d23878ac0c421ca9b61\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6432/commits/7ed113712bb5a6f574e70d23878ac0c421ca9b61</a> I've manually implemented <code>Arbitrary</code> for <code>CompilerStrategy</code> to unconditionally return <code>Cranelift</code>, then in the differential target, I override the strategy if the intention is to fuzz Winch. </p>\n</blockquote>",
