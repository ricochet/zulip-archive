We don't have a native version of this, so we break it down into multiple ops, using a slightly modified formula from Hacker's Delight.</p>\n<p>The original formula does a floor average round, but we correct that by using a special shift right instruction that rounds up the result. I <em>think</em> this is correct, but would appreciate a double check on it.</p>\n<p>This passes both the cranelift tests, as well as the wasmtime <code>*_arith2</code> test suites, however we can't enable them yet because they also require <code>iabs</code> which is only implemented in #6598.</p>\n</blockquote>",
