I'm going to merge both test files.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any reason not to run the new i128 tests for aarch64 and x86_64? I see we don't run any i128 tests on s390x yet but the other two are tested for... well, almost all of the i128 runtests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, they aren't implemented in those backends. And honestly I think its too many ops to just file bugs for them, I'm going to spam the issue stream if I file a separate issue for every instruction that is unimplemented on i128, i16, i8 - AArch64 / x86 / s390x. Although I wish there was a better solution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a separate PR, would you like to try turning those on and see if that turns up any easy interpreter fixes?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, I'll look into this.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In the interpreter this <em>always</em> traps, but it looks like it is configurable with the <code>avoid_div_traps</code> flag.</p>\n<p>I've moved all inputs that don't trigger this behaviour into the <code>urem.clif</code> and <code>srem.clif</code> and we now run all inputs twice, with and without the flag. <code>div-checks.clif</code> remains to test the other inputs.</p>\n<p>This being said, the tests don't crash if I turn on or off that flag, so I'm not quite sure how well that is being tested. It is also a confusing flag name since we will still trap if we try to divide by zero.</p>\n<p>The good news is that we were also not testing these cases (<code>INT_MIN % -1</code>) in the interpreter but are now!</p>\n</blockquote>",
