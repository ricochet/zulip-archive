Currently Cranelift accepts x86_64-unknown-linux-gnux32 as target but treats it as x86_64-unknown-linux including usage of 64bit pointers. Cranelift should either implement actual x32 support or reject building a <code>TargetIsa</code> for it.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>Avoid silent miscompilation.</p>\n</blockquote>",
