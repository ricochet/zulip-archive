In case of cg_clif I currently have the option to either duplicate code to handle 128bit and larger or smaller vectors or to use scalar emulations everywhere. I am using scalar emulations at the moment, but I would like to be able to always use vector instructions.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>Similar to how i128 is handled.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Not implement this and force all embedders to do the splitting themself.</p>\n</blockquote>",
