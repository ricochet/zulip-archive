That can happen either because there's a lot of source code in that function, or because the toolchain (e.g. LLVM) inlined a lot of other functions into it before generating WebAssembly.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Because this is a fair amount of code and there are a lot of corner cases with interpreting DWARF, <em>especially</em> when you start trying to be robust against buggy producers and toolchains. If there isn't a strong motivation to avoid that crate here, I'd much rather rely upon it.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I started off by looking at the implementation of <code>wasm-tools addr2line</code> and how it uses the <code>addr2line</code> crate, but I got confused. I had an easier time understanding how to use <code>gimli</code> directly.</p>\n<p>Also, <code>addr2line</code> was relying on parts of the DWARF that were constructed incorrectly in the wasm binary I was looking at: in addition to file/line number, it also tried to find which (possibly inlined) function frames included each instruction. I fixed <code>gimli</code> upstream to be more forgiving of those errors, which are introduced by <code>wasm-opt</code>, but I don't think we've pulled in the new version yet. Maybe we can use <code>addr2line</code> without that feature? I haven't checked.</p>\n<p>It certainly makes sense to use the <code>addr2line</code> crate here but I suspect it'll be a bit before I can get the details right. How would you feel about merging this version now and coming back to this later?</p>\n</blockquote>",
