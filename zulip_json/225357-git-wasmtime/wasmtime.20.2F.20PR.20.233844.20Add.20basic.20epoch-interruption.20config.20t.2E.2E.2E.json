However, the \"trap on epoch<br>\nchange\" behavior works even for synchronous stores, and if we never<br>\nchange the epoch, then we should see the same behavior as without epoch<br>\ninterruption instrumentation.</p>\n<p>This will at least give us coverage of the codegen, and ensure that the<br>\ncodegen is compatible with all control flow, etc. that we otherwise<br>\ngenerate; and will check one half of correct execution, namely \"no<br>\ninterruptions happen when we don't expect any\".</p>\n<p>Created due to @alexcrichton noting that we don't have coverage of<br>\nepoch-related codegen in <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/oss-fuzz-coverage/wasmtime/reports/20220222/linux/src/wasmtime/crates/cranelift/src/func_environ.rs.html\">this oss-fuzz coverage report</a> (thanks!).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
