Any unsupported tests will be commented out from the spec tests and as more features are added the corresponding tests will be uncommented. This involves a bit of duplication with regards to the spec tests, but the ideal end state is to have Winch be just another strategy in <code>build.rs</code> and have both compilers use <code>./tests/spec_testsuite</code> instead of using a custom directory for Winch once Winch offers feature parity.</p>\n<p>Note that I'm currently collecting feedback on this idea, and for that reason, I've only included the block spec as an example. </p>\n<p>We discussed this idea during today's Winch meeting: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/meetings/blob/main/winch/2023/winch-06-20.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/meetings/blob/main/winch/2023/winch-06-20.md</a></p>\n<p>@cfallin and @alexcrichton I'm interested in your thoughts regarding this change. </p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Similar to how riscv64 runs all the tests but skips anything simd related. That'd avoid having two copies of the tests and would attempt, by default, to run everything in Winch and Winch would have an allow-list that slowly grows or a deny-list that slowly gets smaller.</p>\n</blockquote>",
