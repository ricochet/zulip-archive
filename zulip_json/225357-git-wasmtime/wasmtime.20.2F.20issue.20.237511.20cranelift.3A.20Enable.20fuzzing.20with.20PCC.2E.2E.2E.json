You want to be able to say \"<code>x</code> is less than <code>0xffff_fffc</code>, and also <code>gv2</code>\" basically, and let <code>Fact::intersect</code> produce that. Given that, it might make sense to fuzz only static-memory cases with a guard region, which are the default in Wasmtime and are way simpler, and should not hit this case.</p>\n<p>Sorry, was hacking on this fix then the kid intervened -- I can get back to it in February :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",
