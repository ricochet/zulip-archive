The reason for this change is a mismatch in behavior between the ISLE constructors for those pseudo instructions and the existing rust functions for constructing them: the rust functions always ensure that the first source and destination registers are the same, while the isle functions introduce a fresh destination register and take the two sources as arguments.</p>\n<p>This change preserves the existing behavior for instructions constructed through the rust functions, but allows the lower.isle to use instructions like <code>(x64_xor x x)</code> where <code>x</code> is a fresh register without causing a panic in RA2.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
