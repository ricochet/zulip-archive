In an effort to support this a<br>\n<code>Linker</code> supports defining the same names twice so long as they're<br>\ndefined with differently-typed values.</p>\n<p>This ended up causing wast testsuite failures module linking is enabled,<br>\nhowever, because the wrong error message is returned. While it would be<br>\npossible to fix this there's already the possibility for confusing error<br>\nmessages today due to the <code>Linker</code> trying to take on this type-level<br>\ncomplexity. In a way this is yet-another type checker for wasm imports,<br>\nbut sort of a bad one because it only supports things like<br>\nglobals/functions, and otherwise you can only define one <code>Memory</code>, for<br>\nexample, with a particular name.</p>\n<p>This commit completely removes this feature from <code>Linker</code> to simplify<br>\nthe implementation and make error messages more straightforward. This<br>\nmeans that any error message coming from a <code>Linker</code> is purely \"this<br>\nthing wasn't defined\" rather than a hybrid of \"maybe the types didn't<br>\nmatch?\". I think this also better aligns with the direction that we see<br>\nconventional wasm modules going which is that duplicate imports are not<br>\never present.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
