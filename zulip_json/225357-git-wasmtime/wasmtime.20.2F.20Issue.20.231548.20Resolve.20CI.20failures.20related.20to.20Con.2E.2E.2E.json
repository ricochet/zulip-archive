To answer the question: we have a custom set of legalizations we run in <code>simple_legalize()</code>, but we also avoid using the existing constant-pool functionality (there were some complexities around arm64 PC-relative addressing range and large functions, so we embed constants in the code section), so we'll have to think a bit more about this. The <code>unimplemented!()</code> is good for now, I suppose.</p>\n</blockquote>",
