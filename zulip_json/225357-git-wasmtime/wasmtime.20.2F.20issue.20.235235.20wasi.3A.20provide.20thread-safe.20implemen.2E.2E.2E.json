At a <code>Config</code> level we can implement a simplistic check that verifies <code>wasm_threads</code> and <code>async_support</code> are not both enabled. At the runtime layer for wiggle/wasi-common the goal would be \"what's the smallest delta to support threads while not disturbing everything that's already there too much\". I don't know the scale of the changes necessary, though, and I imagine that the implementation of <code>RwLock</code> and etc could have a large impact. In any case though I mostly wanted to outline that my reasoning is to avoid the need for refactorings unless necessary, I'm not trying to add undue work -- but at the same time recognizing that wiggle/wasi-common are used in production today and shouldn't regress from where they are.</p>\n</blockquote>",
