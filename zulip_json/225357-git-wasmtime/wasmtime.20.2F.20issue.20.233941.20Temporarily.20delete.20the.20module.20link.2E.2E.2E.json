Basically I think we should consider all module-linking-using things as \"dead code walking\" which will be deleted as soon as its convenient and otherwise the component model is a work-in-progress proposal which has varying degrees of support in our tooling until everything is finished (which will take some time). That being said though writing tests is gonna be hard without <code>wast</code>.</p>\n<p>For disabling I mostly just mean either disabling the tests or otherwise deleting the relevant code. Where it makes sense I think the code can be kept to be transformed to work with the component model but otherwise if the code isn't too applicable to the component model I think it's fine to delete (which is where I believe Wasmtime itself sits)</p>\n<p>Also sorry I forgot about <code>wasmlink</code>!

In that sense we don't currently have plans to backport any module linking fixes.</p>\n<p>That being said the decision to remove module linking was largely under the pretext that we didn't know of any active users and it wouldn't be too much of a burden for smaller uses like wit-bindgen and wizer to pause testing of module linking temporarily. You're right that it will take some time to implement the component model to get it to the same level of fidelity of support that module linking had.</p>\n<p>If y'all are using module linking internally though and find it difficult to move away would you be up for attending a Wasmtime meeting to discuss your use case?
