This will simplify the changes in #5172, as that PR introduces the need to allocate temporary registers from the ABI context.</p>\n<p>This change also allows us to remove some fields from <code>VCode</code>: <code>reftyped_vregs_set</code> and <code>have_ref_values</code>. Additionally, the <code>vcode_types</code> field appears to be only used for its length after the <code>VCode</code> is  built, so we could probably replace that field with a <code>u32</code> as well.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
