The bulk of this change was performed this way:</p>\n<p><code>git grep -lF '.with_allocs(' | xargs sed -i 's/\\.with_allocs([^)]*)/.clone()/g'</code></p>\n<p>In a couple cases, this makes the <code>AllocationConsumer</code> unused at these methods' call sites. Rather than changing function signatures in this PR, just mark those arguments as deliberately unused.</p>\n<p>The number of structures being cloned here is unfortunate, and unnecessary now that we don't need to mutate any of them. But switching to borrowing them is a bigger change than I want to include here.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm very much in favor of the incremental approach here :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",
