I'm not sure we want to document <code>wast</code> too widely though since I don't think it's generally considered that stable of a format. The support we have is largely just for convenience in running spec tests, but tbh we don't use this interface to run spec tests anyway right now so we may want to remove this command at some point if <code>wast</code> is not all that stable.</p>\n</blockquote>",
