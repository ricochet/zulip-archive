Correct me if I'm missing something, but I think it's relying on the lowering rules for <code>extractlane</code> to produce specific instructions, without having any clear connection between the two sets of rules. Not only are they far removed from each other, but this rule checks that the result type <code>fits_in_16</code>, while that rule checks that the argument type is <code>multi_lane 8</code> or <code>multi_lane 16</code>.</p>\n<p>At minimum I think each place needs a comment referring to the other.

For the case of <code>extractlane</code> that's pretty easy since it's a single instruction and the <code>extractlane</code> rules themselves aren't fancy. That's still somewhat brittle though as it doesn't handle evolution of <code>extractlane</code> over time (if at all).</p>\n<p>Perhapes more worrisome, though, is the preexisting cases for dropping a <code>uextend</code>. The pattern matches for 32-bit I think have the same trait where they don't necessarily guarantee a particular instruction is being used, we're just relying on things being implemented in a particular way. That part I don't know how best to solve because I definitely wouldn't want to inline all the <code>iadd</code> rules here, for example.</p>\n<p>Do you think it's worthwhile to comment all of these though? While perhaps exhaustive it may be getting a bit out of hand since a good handful of the binops span multiple terminals of rules and if the purpose of the comment is to say \"please always use the <code>sub</code> intruction here or something else that zeros the upper 32-bits for <code>uextend</code> elision\" then it's easy to miss that if it's only located at the top of the rules.</p>\n<p>I suppose an even crazier strategy would be to postprocess the instructions after lowering, but that naturally has no existing infrastructure and is almost certainly overkill for this one use case.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

That needs a bit more thought to refine the right abstractions though.</p>\n<p>We could also optimize VCode; at various points we've talked about post-lowering GVN, cprop, etc., and eliding redundant uextends could be a part of that.
