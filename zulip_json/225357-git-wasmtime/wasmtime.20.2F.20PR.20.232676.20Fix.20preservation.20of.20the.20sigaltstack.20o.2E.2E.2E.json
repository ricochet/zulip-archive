It turns out that our switch to <code>siglongjmp</code> from <code>longjmp</code><br>\nactually broke macOS! This breakage happens because all subsequent<br>\nsignals after the first signal are all delivered on the main stack, not<br>\nthe sigaltstack, even if the sigaltstack is configured. This causes the<br>\nGo runtime to crash since it expects to run on the sigaltstack.</p>\n<p>The fix in this commit is to actually return from the signal handler to<br>\ntrigger the kernel's updating of the sigaltstack no longer being in use.<br>\nBefore we return, however, we configure the register context to return<br>\nto to call some custom code which immediately does the unwind we would<br>\notherwise have done. This works around the issue on macOS hopefully<br>\nwithout adding too many portability problems. Ideally this will all go<br>\naway as well with #2632 as well.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
