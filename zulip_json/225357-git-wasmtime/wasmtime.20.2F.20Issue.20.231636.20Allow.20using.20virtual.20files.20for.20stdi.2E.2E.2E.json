If that one lands, then given all the design changes introduced to <code>wasi-common</code>, it'll make sense to close this one in favour of #1600. However, if we decide not go with #1561, then I'll be happy to land your fix instead. Oh, and thanks a lot for the PR! It's much appreciated! :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",
