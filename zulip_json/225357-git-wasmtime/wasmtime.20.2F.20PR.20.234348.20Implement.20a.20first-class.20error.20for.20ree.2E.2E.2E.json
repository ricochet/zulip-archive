Given all<br>\nthe signatures of how we call functions and how functions are called on<br>\nthe host there's no real feasible way that I know of to hook these two<br>\nup \"seamlessly\". This means that a component which reexports an imported<br>\nfunction can't be run in Wasmtime.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons for this is that when calling a component<br>\nfunction Wasmtime wants to lower arguments first and then have them<br>\nlifted when the host is called. With a reexport though there's not<br>\nactually anything to lower into so we'd sort of need something similar<br>\nto a table on the side or maybe a linear memory and that seems like it'd<br>\nget quite complicated quite quickly for not really all that much<br>\nbenefit. As-such for now this simply returns a first-class error (rather<br>\nthan the current panic) in situations like this.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
