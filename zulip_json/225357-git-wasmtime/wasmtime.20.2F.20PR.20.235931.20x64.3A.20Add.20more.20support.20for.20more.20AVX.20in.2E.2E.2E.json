One reason for this is that AVX instructions which operate over 128-bit values always zero the higher-than-128-bits of each register operate on. SSE instructions, however, don't do this. This means that false dependencies can be created between instructions because SSE instructions look like they're intentionally preserving higher bits where AVX instructions intentionally zero them. According to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41303780/why-is-this-sse-code-6-times-slower-without-vzeroupper-on-skylake/41349852#41349852\">this stackoverflow question</a> the processor also tracks whether an instruction has been executed and there's a \"scary red line\" for mixing AVX/SSE.</p>\n<p>On the local meshoptimizer benchmark this PR doesn't actually have any effect on the generate code's performance, or not one that I can measure. In that sense this is more of a hygiene thing than anything else.</p>\n<p>Specifically the changes here were to refactor many ISLE helpers that were generating instructions with <code>SseOpcode.XXX</code> manually to instead using the instruction helpers which will use the AVX variant if enabled. Additionally more AVX instructions were added for moving data to/from memory and such.</p>\n<p>I don't think this 100% handles all the SSE instructions cranelift can generate when AVX is enabled, but it at least raises the bar further and removes a bunch of cases of SSE-generated instructions when AVX is enabled.</p>\n</blockquote>",
