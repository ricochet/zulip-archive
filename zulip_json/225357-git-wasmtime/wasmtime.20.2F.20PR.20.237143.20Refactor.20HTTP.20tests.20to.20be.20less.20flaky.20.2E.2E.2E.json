The port 0 is bound and whatever the OS gives is used for the duration of the test. This prevents tests from possibly interfering with each other.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Server spawning is abstracted behind a single <code>Server</code> type now which internally has http1/2 constructors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Timeouts for server shutdown are removed since they were failing in CI and are likely best handled for each test individually if necessary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a minor cleanup the <code>tokio</code> usage in guest programs was removed as it was boilerplate in this case. This shouldn't affect the runtimes of tests, however.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
