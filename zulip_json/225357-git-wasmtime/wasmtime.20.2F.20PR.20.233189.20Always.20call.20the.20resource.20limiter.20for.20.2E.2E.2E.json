Instead Wasmtime now wraps the minimum size in something a bit<br>\nsmaller than the address space to inform the limiter, which should<br>\nguarantee that although the limiter is called with \"incorrect\"<br>\ninformation it's effectively correct and is allowed a pass to learn that<br>\na massive memory was requested.</p>\n<p>This was found by the fuzzers where a request for the absolute maximal<br>\nsize of 64-bit memory (e.g. the entire 64-bit address space) didn't<br>\nactually invoke the limiter which means that we mis-classified an<br>\ninstantiation error and didn't realize that it was an OOM.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
