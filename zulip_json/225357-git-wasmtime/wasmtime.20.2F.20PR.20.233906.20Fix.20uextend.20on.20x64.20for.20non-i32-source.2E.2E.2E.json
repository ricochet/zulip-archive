Unfortunately, the lowering patterns had a bug in the i32-to-i64 special case (when we know the generating instruction zeroes the upper 32 bits): it wasn't actually special casing for an i32 source! This meant that e.g. zero extends of the results of i8 adds did not work properly.</p>\n<p>This PR fixes the bug and updates the runtest for extends significantly to cover the narrow-value cases.</p>\n<p>No security impact to Wasm as Wasm does not use narrow integer types.</p>\n<p>Thanks @bjorn3 for reporting!</p>\n</blockquote>",
