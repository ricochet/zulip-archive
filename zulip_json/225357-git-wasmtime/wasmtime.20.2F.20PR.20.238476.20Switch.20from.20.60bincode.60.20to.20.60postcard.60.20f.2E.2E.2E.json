Previously Wasmtime used the <code>bincode</code> crate for performing these tasks as the format was generally optimized to be small and fast, not general purpose (e.g. JSON). The <code>bincode</code> crate on <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> doesn't work on <code>no_std</code>, however, and with the work in #8341 that's an issue now for Wasmtime.</p>\n<p>This crate switches instead to the <code>postcard</code> crate. This crate is listed in Serde's documentation as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Postcard, a no_std and embedded-systems friendly compact binary<br>\nformat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I've not personally used it before it checks all the boxes we relied on <code>bincode</code> for and additionally works with <code>no_std</code>. After auditing the crate this commit then switches out Wasmtime's usage of <code>bincode</code> for <code>postcard</code> throughout the repository.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
