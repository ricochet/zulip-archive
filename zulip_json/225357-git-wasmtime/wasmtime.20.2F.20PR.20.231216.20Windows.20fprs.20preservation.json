Unwind only concerns itself with unwinding the operations done in the prologue, therefore it is only interested in the register save space and not where any arguments for callees might be stored.  RSP should not adjust (except by a call) after the frame is established unless it's a \"dynamic\" (alloca) frame, at which point a frame pointer must be used.  Since we're using a frame pointer anyway, we also need that \"frame pointer offset\" adjustment so that it unwinds from the right base.</p>\n<p>What I don't get is why frames with a frame pointer need to be described using this \"base address\" rather than just treating every unwind operation offset as <em>negative</em> from the frame pointer when there is one and positive from RSP when there is not.  This seems unnecessarily complicated, but I'm sure there's a good reason.</p>\n</blockquote>",
