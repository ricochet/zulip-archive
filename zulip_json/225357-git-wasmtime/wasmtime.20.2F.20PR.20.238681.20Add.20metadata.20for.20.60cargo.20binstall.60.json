I've seen the <code>cargo binstall</code> method of installing binaries to be somewhat common and we've already got all the necessary binaries so it seemed nice to add support. Wasmtime doesn't name the artifacts after Rust target names so some manual configuration is required here, but otherwise this hopefully isn't too costly to maintain.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
