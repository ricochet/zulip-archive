Also, remove the unused type fields from all variants and from <code>gen_get_stack_addr</code>.</p>\n<p>The three kinds of stack addresses that we currently need to generate in a target independent way refer to either caller or callee argument areas, or refer to the spill slots and explicit stack slots within the frame.</p>\n<p>It is a target-specific implementation detail whether the incoming argument area is indexed relative to the frame pointer, or whether the stack slots are located by tracking a \"nominal\" stack pointer offset.</p>\n<p>So let's not muddy up the target-independent code by using names that refer to these target-specific concepts.</p>\n</blockquote>",
