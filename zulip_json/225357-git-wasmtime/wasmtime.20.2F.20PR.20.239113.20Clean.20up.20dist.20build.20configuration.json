Otherwise though the main motivation here was to mroe tightly couple the addition of the environment's Rust compiler to the docker image itself. Previously that was spread across this <code>main.js</code> and each <code>Dockerfile</code>, but now it's entirely contained within this <code>main.js</code> alone. In theory that should make the <code>Dockerfile</code> images a bit more freestanding and self-describing. </p>\n<p>I realize though in the end this is all intertwined anyway so it probably doesn't help all that much really.</p>\n</blockquote>",
