The specific case in<br>\nquestion instantiated a module with ~100 memories ~100 times, and each<br>\nmemory reserved ~8gb of the virtual address space. This takes around 47<br>\nbits of addressable memory which is mighty close to the limit of what<br>\ncan be done on x86_64, so this commit reduces the number of memories<br>\nthat an instance may have when coming out of <code>wasm-smith</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
