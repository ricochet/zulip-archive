In addition some linker don't like mixing attributes between sections that get merged, so if the user of cg_clif specified that the data object needs to end up in <code>__TEXT/__cstring</code>, we will need to respect the <code>cstring_literals</code> section type likely specified by the user too.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>cranelift-jit can ignore this and cranelift-object can use <code>SectionKind::ReadOnlyString</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
