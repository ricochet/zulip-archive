This is a major milestone towards allowing Cranelift to compile code while in embedded or kernel environments.</p>\n<p>I do still have a handful of pinch points to work through before this is ready to merge.</p>\n<p>First of all, the most major overhaul I've made to the <code>codegen</code> crate is to replace <code>rustc-hash</code> with <code>hashbrown</code> and <code>ahash</code>. I'm not a cryptography expert but as far as I can tell, <code>ahash</code> does have a security improvement over <code>FxHash</code> in terms of improved DOS resistance. More importantly though, <code>hashbrown</code> has a feature to use <code>ahash</code> by default, which means that replacing <code>FxHashMap</code> and <code>FxHashSet</code> was as easy as a few invocations of <code>sed</code>. However, I believe that this switch in hashing function has caused some of the codegen expected output tests in CI to fail, and the semantics of the codegen have been slightly changed. I could experiment with swapping <code>rustc-hash</code> back into <code>hashbrown</code> as its hasher implementation locally but I wanted to know if preserving these semantics was important before I undertook another major type substitution throughout the code. Please take a look at the output of the failing CI for more info.</p>\n<p>Second of all, on no_std, floating-point arithmetic is not available. To resolve this, I brought in the <code>core_math</code> crate, which implements floating-point arithmetic traits for core primitives using libm's implementation of softfloat. However, the function <code>rounding_ties_even()</code> is not available in <code>libm</code>, and I'm not sure how to go about replacing it. Input would be appreciated. I do know that if the failing codegen output unit tests I discussed are updated to pass with the new output, other tests catch the change in arithmetic semantics and fail.</p>\n<p>Finally, there's this <code>else</code> block in <code>src/machinst/vcode.rs</code> that has some arithmetic with a hard dependency on the <code>unwind</code> feature, which is unsupported on <code>no_std</code>. I'm not sure what to do with that.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for the help with all of this, I appreciate your time immensely. I'm really happy to answer any questions and update my code as needed.</p>\n</blockquote>",
