This would shuffle the <code>uses</code> list of registers to not be sorted like the assertion was expecting. The fix in this commit is to just go ahead and sort the list of <code>uses</code> to ensure that registers are peeled off in order.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
