I do agree with you @alexcrichton that this is pretty subtle in the sense that we're relying on this prior knowledge that we've actually done just that. If it wasn't the case, we'd in a lot of trouble. Then again, since <code>yanix</code>, and in general, the syscall impl code in <code>wasi-common</code> _only_ (at least for now!) deals with raw OS errno values, this is safe. And since we're constantly evolving WASI, having panics around those calls might be a good thing to catch bugs that otherwise would be silently swallowed as @sunfishcode pointed out.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Currently, Yanix would return a custom error that's a wrapper around three other error types returned by various entities inside Rust's <code>libstd</code>. In particular, Yanix's error type would wrap <code>io::Error</code>, <code>num::TryFromIntError</code> and <code>ffi::NulError</code>. It turns out that there is a natural conversion between the first and the last and provided by the standard library, i.e., <code>From&lt;ffi::NulError&gt; for io::Error</code> is provided. So at the surface it may seem that only the first two wrapped error types are worth keeping.</p>\n<p>Digging a little bit deeper into <code>libstd</code>, <code>num::TryFromIntError</code> is essentially speaking only a marker that the integral conversion went wrong. The struct implementing this error stores a unit type, and nothing more. It therefore seems like a waste to wrap this particular error when we could unify everything under <code>io::Error</code>. And so, whenever we perform an int conversion, I suggest we simply remap the error to <code>io::Error::from_raw_os_error(libc::EOVERFLOW)</code> since this carries a comparable amount of information.</p>\n<p>As a result of completely discarding <code>yanix::Error</code> custom error type, we are invariably simplifying <code>yanix</code> itself, but also allowing <code>wasi-common</code> to simplify in several places as well.</p>\n<p>I'm curious to see what you guys reckon!</p>\n</blockquote>",
