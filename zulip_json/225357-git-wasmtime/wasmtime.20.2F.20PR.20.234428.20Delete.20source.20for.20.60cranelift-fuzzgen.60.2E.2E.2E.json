To fix that build this commit removes the fuzzgen<br>\nsource entirely and relies on our git history to recover the original<br>\nsource in the future when the target is fixed.</p>\n<p>[this line]: <a href=\"https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/daa879e5fea1ba04f9695ea3fdf7f2cbe7c8ad78/projects/wasmtime/build.sh#L49\">https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/daa879e5fea1ba04f9695ea3fdf7f2cbe7c8ad78/projects/wasmtime/build.sh#L49</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
