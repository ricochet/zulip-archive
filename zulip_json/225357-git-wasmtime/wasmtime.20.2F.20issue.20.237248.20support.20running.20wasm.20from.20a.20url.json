Not even from a file stored on the disk. It needs the entire file in memory at once currently. In any case even once it supports streaming, I think it would make more sense to accept an <code>std::io::Read</code> implementation rather than having a specific api for downloading from the internet. The web api also effectively does this. <code>instantiateStreaming</code> accepts a fetch <code>Response</code> (or a promise that will return a <code>Response</code>), not directly a url.</p>\n</blockquote>",

So <code>xdg-open https://github.com/torch2424/wasm-by-example/blob/master/examples/hello-world/demo/assemblyscript/hello-world.wasm</code> works. I have a small utility called <a href=\"https://github.com/dvc94ch/xdg-url-open\"><code>xdg-url-open</code></a> registered as the default handler for <code>x-scheme-handler/https</code> which then identifies the default program based on the extension (in this case <code>wasmtime</code>) and then opens it in <code>wasmtime</code>. I guess I can build my own wrapper for wasmtime if I want to make this work.</p>\n<p>My particular use case is to kill the web/browser with a searchable p2p document store that supports opening the files in native tools (pdf, media, wasm) using ai to do image captioning and speech to text to enable full text search.</p>\n</blockquote>",
