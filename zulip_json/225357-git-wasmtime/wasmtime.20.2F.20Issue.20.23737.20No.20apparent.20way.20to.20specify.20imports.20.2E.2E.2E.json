While the main use case for WASI might be to access the low-level syscalls supported by the interface, we should still be able to build WASI modules that import from the runtime host. The ability to specify imports for a WASI module is a feature that's available on other runtimes.</p>\n<p>Is there a way using existing public functions to configure imports for a WASI module?</p>\n</blockquote>",
