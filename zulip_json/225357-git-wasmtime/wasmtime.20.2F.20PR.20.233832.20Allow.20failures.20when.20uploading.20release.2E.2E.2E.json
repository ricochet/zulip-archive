Artifacts are uploaded to the job, however,<br>\nwhich means we can always go back and grab them to upload them, unless<br>\nthe whole job was cancelled. For 0.34.1 it looks like the Linux builder<br>\nhit an error but its error then subsequently cancelled the Windows<br>\nbuilders, so we don't actually have artifacts for Windows for the 0.34.1<br>\nrelease. This will hopefully prevent this from causing further issues in<br>\nthe future where if one builder hits an error while uploading artifacts<br>\nthe others will continue and we can manually upload what's missing if<br>\nnecessary.</p>\n<p>cc #3812</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
