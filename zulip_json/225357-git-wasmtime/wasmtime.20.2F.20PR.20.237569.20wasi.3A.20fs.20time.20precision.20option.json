Assuming that the system is only reporting timestamps with rounded precision already, this means that all timestamps in play should all be appropriately rounded, right? If that's the case that's why I don't understand why this function exists, although I understand that if arbitrary durations were added to timestamps it would be required.</p>\n</blockquote>",
