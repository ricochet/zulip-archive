The test cases all reproduce on <code>main</code> however so I don't think they're related to this PR and at least one of them reproduced after I applied the addi4spn fix too. Reproduction has been difficult due to the fact that these tests are using libcalls I believe. One issue to fix was that <code>clif-util test</code> doesn't support libcalls in its <code>test interpret</code> mode, but while that was easy enough to fix I hit a panic where relocations failed to be appplied because I assume the libcall target was &gt;4G away as an assertion in <code>Reloc::RiscvCallPlt</code> was tripped.</p>\n<p>In any case I remove the <code>iconst</code>-is-always-extended logic and otherwise I'll likely be relying on the fuzzing your doing for this as I've not been too successful locally. It did run for a few hours though without finding other bugs which seems good!</p>\n<p>Additionally I removed the rules that modify an immediate with <code>+1</code> since that was the cause of the issue fuzzing found above. I'll need to look more at that later, but figure this may be good to get in without blocking on that.</p>\n</blockquote>",
