Maybe we could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define a new <code>ProducesFlags</code> enum arm that holds two instructions in sequence;</li>\n<li>Define a <code>ccmp</code> helper that takes an existing <code>ProducesFlags</code> and returns a <code>ProducesFlags</code>, gluing the <code>ccmp</code> onto the end of the existing producer as an \"update\" to the flags. (It's OK if we only handle the two-instruction case here for now; we can extend the enum later if necessary)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>",
