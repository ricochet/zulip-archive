Most of these edits are changing meaning in fairly important ways, and the ones that don't seem to be minor style things / subjective preferences, so I think I'd prefer not to accept an edit pass on this document -- given the magnitude of your changes I don't want to spend the time it would take to iterate back to fully correct wording. Thanks anyway, I'm sure you intended well. I'll go ahead and close this PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The first (current) form has a subordinate clause describing what the specification does, and the verb indicates that this specification can be compiled. Your rewrite somehow attaches two actions onto \"specification\" -- it describes, and it can be compiled. These aren't semantically equivalent.</p>\n</blockquote>",
