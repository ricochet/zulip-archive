Using the end-of-func constant pool here as well might be a nice improvement for a followup PR, especially if the data lands in the middle of an inner loop and pushes the body into another icache line or fetch cycle...</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't know whether filetests run with or without optimizations, but I would guess without.</p>\n<p>Avoiding the 0-case is required for the shift-right cases for correctness since it looks like right-shifts with zero-width can't be encoded as such an instruction (I think this has to do with how right-shift is a negative left-shift on AArch64 or something like that, so maybe this is a too-strict assertion somewhere, not sure, I didn't dig deeply enough to go that far).</p>\n<p>I went ahead and added the case here as requested for shift-lefts even though it isn't strictly necessary as required by the backend. In some sense though it does sort of feel like if someone reads that rule it depends on the time of day as to whether they would judge whether or not the rule should be included, so in that sense I don't know whether to leave it in or not as it's not obviously correct nor obviously incorrect.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't feel too strongly about this case; I guess I would note that it's a nice symmetry with the right-shift case here (which is why it popped out at me originally). On the other hand, we don't special-case <code>x + 0</code> in the backends, nor should we. So... I'll happily hand the baton to @jameysharp for final judgment here and only request that we extend the mid-end rule to understand masking and cover this case.</p>\n</blockquote>",
