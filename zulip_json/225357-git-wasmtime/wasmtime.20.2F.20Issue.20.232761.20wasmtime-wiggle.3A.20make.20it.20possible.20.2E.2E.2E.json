This does add a lot of API surface but effectively its just out-lining the functionality that is already there for <code>add_to_config</code>, which is implemented in terms of these new functions.</p>\n<p>I'd like to defer adding compile-time config for this for a little bit. It is an optimization, but for code should get called once per engine creation. I expect plenty more structural changes to wiggle coming down the pipe as witx and friends evolve, so I don't want to add more complexity to the macro right now if we don't have to.</p>\n</blockquote>",
