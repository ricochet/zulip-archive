The goal of this commit is to address concerns raised in #7336 and other locations as well. While the new CLI cannot be un-shipped at this point this PR attempts to ameliorate the situation somewhat through a few avenues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete copy of the old CLI parser is now included in <code>wasmtime</code> by default.</li>\n<li>The <code>WASMTIME_NEW_CLI=0</code> environment variable can force usage of the old CLI parser for the <code>run</code> and <code>compile</code> commands.</li>\n<li>The <code>WASMTIME_NEW_CLI=1</code> environment variable can force usage of the new CLI parser.</li>\n<li>Otherwise both the old and the new CLI parser are executed. Depending on the result one is selected to be executed, possibly with a warning printed.</li>\n<li>If both CLI parsers succeed but produce the same result, then no warning is emitted and execution continues as usual.</li>\n<li>If both CLI parsers succeed but produce different results then a warning is emitted indicating this. The warning points to #7384 which has further examples of how to squash the warning. The warning also mentions the above env var to turn the warning off. In this situation the old semantics are used at this time instead of the new semantics. It's intended that eventually this will change in the future.</li>\n<li>If the new CLI succeeds and the old CLI fails then the new semantics are executed without warning.</li>\n<li>If the old CLI succeeds and the new CLI fails then a warning is issued and the old semantics are used.</li>\n<li>If both the old and the new CLI fail to parse then the error message for the new CLI is emitted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that this doesn't add up to a perfect transition. The hope is that most of the major cases of change at the very least have something printed. My plan is to land this on <code>main</code> and then backport it to the 14.0.0 branch as a 14.0.3 release.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

One difference though is that I approach this sort of design assuming users are reactionary. For example I would predict that users won't a-priori take a look at their system and ensure that all the versions are aligned based on a blog post we publish. Instead they'll execute their normal workflow or some workflow documented elsewhere and then all of a sudden a warning pops up. In that sense they may not be aware that Wasmtime was even being used let alone perhaps what vector Wasmtime was installed through. In that sense I'd assume the immediate questions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I resolve this warning now? For this the warning explains <code>WASMTIME_NEW_CLI=0</code> is the way to go. Most users might just stop here.</li>\n<li>How do I resolve the warning for the future? The warning for this explains that this will break, links to an issue with more context, and provides the env var to see the breakage. Further action though in fixing this would require them knowing how Wasmtime was invoked/installed and how to update, which I don't think the warning can help with.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In that sense I'm not sure I understand what you mean by this message requiring inference as to what's going on. My hope was to have full context behind an issue for interested folks, so not everything is explained here, but I'm not sure how adding versioning information would be helpful.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I might see that it succeeded but there's still a warning and be a bit confused; the immediate suggestion is to set an environment variable; what I really want is direct feedback of \"I interpreted this the old way\" or \"I interpreted this the new way\". Without that, it's a little bit of an opaque magic box and I can see it being confusing.
