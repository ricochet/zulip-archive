This is a bit nonsensical, as we are validating a native memory address as if it were a Wasm memory address.</p>\n<p>Now, we no longer do a <code>heap_addr</code> to translate the Wasm memory address to a native memory address. Instead, we pass the Wasm memory address to the libcall, and the libcall is responsible for doing the bounds check (by calling <code>validate_atomic_addr</code> with the correct type of memory address now).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
