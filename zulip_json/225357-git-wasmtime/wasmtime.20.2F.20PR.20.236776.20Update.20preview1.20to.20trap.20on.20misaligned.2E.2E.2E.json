Unfortunately, it looks like instead of using a From&lt;GuestError&gt; impl there, it instead uses a pattern of Result&lt;_, GuestError&gt;::or(Err(Errno::Inval)) at each call site, so that is a tougher job. Its OK to not take that on as part of this PR, but we should file an issue on it if you want to defer it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
