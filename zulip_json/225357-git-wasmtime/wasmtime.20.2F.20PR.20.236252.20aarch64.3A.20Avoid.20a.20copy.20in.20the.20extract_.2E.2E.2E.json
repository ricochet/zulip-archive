This only changes register assignments on this PR, but in RA2-0.7.0 where support for program moves has been removed, this avoids an additional move in the resulting program.<br>\n&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
