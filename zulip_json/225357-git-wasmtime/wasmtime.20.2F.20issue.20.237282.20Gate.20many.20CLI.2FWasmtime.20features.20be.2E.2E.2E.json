Out of curiosity is this something where you're concerned about binary size of the ittapi dependency? Or is it otherwise not building for you for one reason or another? </p>\n<p>One reason I unified them was I also placed the guest profiler behind the same <code>profiling</code> feature and by having a complete on/off switch it would enable conditionally compiling out even more code as well in theory too. I was hoping to avoid a feature-per-profiler, so if possible I'd prefer to solve the problem without splitting it back up, but that depends on the issue that you're having and if it can only be solved by adding a vtune feature back that seems ok too</p>\n</blockquote>",

To be clear, I agree with that policy.</p>\n<p>I don't personally care about ittapi's effect on binary size. I care about the fact I now have ittapi in scope and will have to, eventually, read through and audit ittapi to ensure it's non-malicious (or import the Bytecode Alliance's vet statement for it, which I can assume exists). While I can recognize the library is hosted and maintained by Intel, the actual publishers of the crate are three individuals, any of who could be compromised.</p>\n<p>TL;DR It increases my supply chain and complicates the package graph for no benefit to me, making this a downgrade in wasmtime's utility.</p>\n<p>Again. I don't mind the profiling feature. I just wish I could still access the original jitdump feature. Accordingly, I believe this can be implemented <em>without</em> hurting the performance/effects/code-gen of the profiling feature.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If it's ok with you I'd prefer to stay the current course, however. Wasmtime doesn't guarantee that we won't add new dependencies with new version of Wasmtime even with default features disabled. That being said we do guarantee that all dependencies used by Wasmtime have a vetted version by BA maintainers.</p>\n<p>Otherwise I'd personally prefer to avoid sharding the <code>profiling</code> feature into a feature-per-strategy as well as that feels like a bit of an overload of Cargo features (we already have a lot).
