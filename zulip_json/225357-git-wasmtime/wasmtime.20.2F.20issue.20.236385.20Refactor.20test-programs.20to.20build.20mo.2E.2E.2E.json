The wasmtime project versions have fallen behind the latest wit-bindgen, and @itsrainy is going to update those shortly with their core dumps work.</p>\n<p>I would typically just wait for that sort of work to finish up to land my PR, but I want to move along quickly so we can change the canonical home of the preview 2 work to this repository, which will unblock several other people.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Thank you @itsrainy.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even with those fixes, there were still multiple versions of <code>wasm-tools</code> crates in the workspace, via the transitive dependencies of <code>wit-bindgen</code>. Alex and I decided that, since wit-bindgen is only used to build component tests, we will add a deny exception for its dependency tree.</p>\n</blockquote>",
