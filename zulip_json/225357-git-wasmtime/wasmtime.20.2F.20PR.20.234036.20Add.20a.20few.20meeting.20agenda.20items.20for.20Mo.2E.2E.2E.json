I wonder if we should re-discuss the tradeoffs here now that we've gathered some real-world experience.</p>\n<p>Second item is an open prompt to discuss some ideas that came from discussion with @abrown and later @fitzgen and @sunfishcode ; ways to make expressing certain patterns in ISLE a bit easier (in a way that is fully backward-compatible).</p>\n<p>Third item is to create some space to discuss the continued ISLE migration progress and get a more concrete picture on what's left to do and what resourcing we have around that.</p>\n<p>Hopefully we'll have enough time to get some useful info/feedback on all of these!</p>\n</blockquote>",
