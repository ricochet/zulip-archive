I'm personally a bit worried about the complexity creep here. Our CI is already pretty nontrivial and adding this into the mix I feel like takes it up to another level of complexity which makes it harder for future contributors/modifications. I can't argue with the results of course, but the merge queue currently reports that the average time-to-merge is 19 minutes so this whould shave 5 minutes off merge time. Given that we generally have an empty queue and we don't have many time-pressured PRs I'm not sure whether the 25% reduction in CI will be worth the complexity increase here.</p>\n<p>I'll admit though I'm pretty biased as I'm still sort of used to the 3-hour-cycle-time from rust-lang/rust so my perception of what's appropriate for CI is likely pretty skewed. I'm curious how others feel as well as to the tradeoff of CI complexity here vs the time reduction.</p>\n</blockquote>",
