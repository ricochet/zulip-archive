I believe that if the header file you're using is configured for dllimport <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api/blob/c9d31284651b975f05ac27cee0bab1377560b87e/include/wasm.h#L12-L18\">which <code>wasm.h</code> is configured to do by default</a> then the function must come from a DLL. In the case of static linking, however, that's not happening. If you pass <code>-DWASM_API_EXTERN</code> to your C compiler does it resolve this issue?</p>\n</blockquote>",
