The current algorithm, with the latest <code>arbitrary</code> crate, generates a 20MB source file which is a bit egregious. The goal here was to get that under control by altering the parameters of test case generation and additionally changing the structure of what's generated.</p>\n<p>The new strategy is to have a limited set of \"type fuel\" which is consumed as a type is generated. This bounds the maximal size of a type in addition to its depth as prior. Additionally a fixed set of types are generated first and then test cases select from these types as opposed to test cases always generating types for themselves. Coupled together this brings the size of the generated file back into the 200K range as it was before.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
