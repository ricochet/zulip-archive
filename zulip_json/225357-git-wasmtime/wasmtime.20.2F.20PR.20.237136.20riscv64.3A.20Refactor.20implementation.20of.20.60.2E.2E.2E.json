I've opted for a slightly more verbose approach than what was present prior to make sign/zero extensions more precise and additionally enable some immediate-related optimizations.</p>\n<p>Divison/remainder by an immediate will no longer emit checks to see if a trap needs to be emitted. Instead only the raw <code>div</code>/<code>rem</code> instructions are emitted. Additionally a few minor sign extensions are now avoided such as the dividend in 32-bit remainders/division because only the low 32-bits are inspected.</p>\n<p>Finally, while I was here, I went ahead an added <code>has_m</code> guards to all these lowering rules. The M extension is always required with riscv64 right now and won't work if it's turned off, but I figure it's not too bad to add in terms of completeness for now.</p>\n<p>As to the meat of the commit, the check for trapping value as part of division now happens without <code>gen_icmp</code> but instead <code>gen_trapif</code> which enables avoiding materializing the comparison's value into a register.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
