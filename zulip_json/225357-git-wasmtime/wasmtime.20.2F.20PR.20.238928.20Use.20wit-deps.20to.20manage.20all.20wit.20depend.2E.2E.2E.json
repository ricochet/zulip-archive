I understand your concerns and have made some improvements. I will no longer use <code>build.rs</code> to update dependencies.

If there are more different versions of wit dependencies in the future, the bash script will become very complex.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>PTAL if this change is reasonable.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Personally though I'd at least personally prefer to stick to the bash script for now. I'm worried to pick up another tool as part of our build which much of us don't understand and it's not buying us much over a bash script. I don't disagree that the bash script is going to get a bit more complicated over time but I think the complexity is relatively manageable. For example it's not really an issue that HTTP WIT files are part of the <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> crate. Adding support for downloading another version of things to a different location shouldn't greatly increase the complexity of the script either.</p>\n<p>Some other reasons I'd prefer to stick to a script for now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installation of <code>wit-deps</code> is yet-another-tool to manage in CI. For example <code>cargo install</code> here doesn't use <code>--locked</code> to prevent errors over time with mistakes in publishing to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>. It also doesn't specify a version to install so we'd be susceptible to breakage in terms of if <code>wit-deps</code>changes. This is all fixable but is adding more overhead relative to a script.</li>\n<li>We can't exclusively use <code>wit-deps</code> because wasi-nn doesn't support it. That means we still need a script to do things. Additionally the script is required to matter what to pass the right arguments to <code>wit-deps</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall I think it may just not be the right time to switch away from bash scripts. If the shell script could go away entirely I think that's the right time to migrate to a different tool, but I don't think that we're there yet.</p>\n</blockquote>",
