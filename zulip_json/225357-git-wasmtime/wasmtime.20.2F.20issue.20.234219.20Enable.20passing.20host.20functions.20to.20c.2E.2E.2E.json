While we can definitely achieve something that I didn't think was possible (closing over the arguments in the return value) it requires many refactorings to the trait bounds and may also affect all callers to do something fancy as well. That's very quickly moving into the reaml of \"while maybe possible almost certainly not plausible\" and I'm not sure how well it would work out here.</p>\n<p>Otherwise my best hope is that the trait bounds involved here for host functions is a relatively isolated part of the implementation of the component model. In some sense there's no need to hold up everything else related to the component model to figure this out. Ideally we can somehow in the future figure out how to improve the \"return a string\" story without needing massive changes to everything else in the implementation.</p>\n</blockquote>",
