In the previous implementation, whenever a specific register was requested as the destination register and a register-to-register moved happened the source register was never marked as free.</p>\n<p>This issue became more evident with more complex programs involving control flow and division for example.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
