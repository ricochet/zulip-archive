The goal here is to be a \"sort of macro instruction\" despite it not being too too macro here. This cuts down on <code>xconstN</code> instructions which both saves space in the final binary and should be slightly more optimal perf-wise due to only one dispatch being needed.</p>\n<p>In this commit the <code>xadd32</code> instruction is previously 3 bytes: one for an opcode and 2 bytes for the dst/src1/src2 binary operands. Adding a small constant to a register previously took 5 bytes where 2 bytes were needed for <code>xconst8 N</code> then 3 for the addition. Here the encoding size of the new instruction is 4 bytes: 1 for the opcode, 2 for dst/src1, and one for the immediate. This is currently chosen to mostly optimize dispatch in the interpreter loop as opposed to code size (as only a single byte is saved). In the future thought it would be possible to extend <code>BinaryOperands</code> to one operand being a 6-bit immediate to preserve the same code size.</p>\n<p>This also notably adds, for addition/subtraction, only unsigned immediates. With addition/subtraction being inverses of one another supporting signed immediates isn't necessary and helps free up another bit for packing numbers into these opcodes.</p>\n<p>This change reduces the size of <code>spidermonkey.cwasm</code> from 31M to 29M locally.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
