This brings in a whole lot of unnecessary features and dependencies that the <code>wasi</code> crate doesn't need. </p>\n<p>Not sure if there was a specific reason for the removal or just a small accident. Anyways, here is a small change to disable <code>wasmtime</code>'s default features again. :) <br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
