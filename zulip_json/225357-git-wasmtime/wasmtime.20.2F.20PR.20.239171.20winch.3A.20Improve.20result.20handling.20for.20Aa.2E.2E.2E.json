Compared to the x64 counterpart, the aarch64 implementation was missing tests for multi-value.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this commit fixes an issue with how multi-value returns are handlded in Winch's default calling convention, which only allows 1 register result, independent of the register class.</p>\n<p>This commit also refactors the register indexing environment so that it can be easily shared across the existing backends.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
