If the witx documents used are different, it will probably mean that the generated code will fail to type-check. This mismatch will probably be puzzling to the user and tricky track down.</p>\n<p>Determine some way to check equivalence of the wasmtime-wiggle's witx document and the target witx document at proc macro time. This may or may not be possible.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>Better assurance of correctness, and it will be more comprehensible when something goes wrong.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>My first thought was that the wasmtime-wiggle macro should emit a <code>#[test]</code> that checks the equivalence between the two witx documents (available via the <code>wiggle_metadata</code> feature) at runtime. However, this approach won't work if the code the macro emits fails to type-check.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure how to actually do this.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n</blockquote>",
