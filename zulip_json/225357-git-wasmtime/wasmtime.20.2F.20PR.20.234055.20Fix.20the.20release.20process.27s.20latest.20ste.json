This failure comes about because it was<br>\ntrying to change the release date of 0.35.0 which ended up not modifying<br>\nany fails so <code>git</code> failed to commit as no files were changed.</p>\n<p>The original bug though was that 0.35.0 was being changed instead of<br>\n0.36.0. The reason for this is that the script used<br>\n<code>--sort=-committerdate</code> to determine the latest branch. I forgot,<br>\nthough, that with backports it's possible for 0.35.0 to have a more<br>\nrecent commit date than 0.36.0 (as is currently the case). This commit<br>\nupdates the script to perform a numerical sort outside of git to get the<br>\nlatest release branch.</p>\n<p>Additionally this adds in some <code>set -ex</code> commands for the shell which<br>\nshould help print out commands as they're run and assist in future<br>\ndebugging.</p>\n<p>[bad]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/runs/6087188708\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/runs/6087188708</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
