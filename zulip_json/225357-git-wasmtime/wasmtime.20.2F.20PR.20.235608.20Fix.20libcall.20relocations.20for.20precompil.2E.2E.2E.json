In doing so this reworks how mmaps are managed for files from disk. All non-file-backed <code>Mmap</code> entries are read/write but file-backed versions were readonly. This commit changes this such that all <code>Mmap</code> objects, even if they're file-backed, start as read/write. The file-based versions all use copy-on-write to preserve the private-ness of the mapping.</p>\n<p>This is not functionally intended to change anything. Instead this should have some more memory writable after a module is loaded but the text section, for example, is still left as read/execute when loading is finished. Additionally this makes modules compiled in memory more consistent with modules loaded from disk.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
