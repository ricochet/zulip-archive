These were<br>\npreviously hosted in this repository, but we found that it makes things<br>\nsomewhat more complex with respect to CI configuration and merge<br>\npermissions to have both small, CI-less changes to the text in<br>\n<code>meetings/</code> as well as changes to everything else in one repository.</p>\n<p>The minutes and agendas have been split out into the repository at<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/meetings/\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/meetings/</a>, with all history<br>\npreserved. Future agenda additions and minutes contributions should go<br>\nthere as PRs.</p>\n<p>Finally, this PR adds a small note to our \"Contributing\" doc to note the<br>\nexistence of the meetings and invite folks to ask to join if interested.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
