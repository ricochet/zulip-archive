This is turned off by default and does not have a runtime or environment-based configuration value. Instead changing this requires changing source code for now. This enables the interpreter loop to unconditionally use this \"debugger\" where it'll compile away to nothing in release/benchmarking situations.</p>\n<p>This commit additionally adds this support to the <code>tail_loop</code> module and fixes a few issues there such as it accidentally not being tested in CI as well as a new <code>#[cfg]</code> to use it on stable rust with normal <code>return</code> under the assumption that LLVM is highly likely to do TCO.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
