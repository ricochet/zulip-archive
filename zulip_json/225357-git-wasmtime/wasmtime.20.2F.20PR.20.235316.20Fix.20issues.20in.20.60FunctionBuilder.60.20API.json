This PR addresses two of them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>FunctionBuilder</code> is supposed to be used to only build a single <code>Function</code>, but <code>FunctionBuilder::finalize()</code> indicates that it can be used for multiples <code>Function</code>s. The first commit fixed that by making <code>finalize()</code> consume <code>self</code>. Nowhere in the codebase <code>FunctionBuilder</code> was reused, so the change was very straight forward.</p>\n<p>The other one was that <code>FunctionBuilder::func</code> was public, which could allow the <code>Function</code> to be messed up mid-translation. I tried replacing it by an immutable <code>func()</code> getter, but in the codebase <code>func</code> is in fact messed with mid-translation. So, I also added a <code>func_mut()</code> getter. I am not sure if this change brings meaningful benefits, so I could remove it if you prefer.</p>\n</blockquote>",
