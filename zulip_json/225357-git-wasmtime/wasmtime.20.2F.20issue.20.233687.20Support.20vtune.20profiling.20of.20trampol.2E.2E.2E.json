This is basically a trampoline-per-type-signature for any functions which are \"possibly exported\", including all those in tables, exported functions, etc.</p>\n<p>The <code>trampoline_load()</code> method is only called for trampolines dynamically created through the <code>Func::new</code> API which generates a one-off trampoline specifically for the signature of the function created. Unless <code>Func::new</code> is called somehow (which it ideally shouldn't be because <code>Func::wrap</code> is a faster embedding) then <code>trampoline_load()</code> won't be invoked.</p>\n</blockquote>",
