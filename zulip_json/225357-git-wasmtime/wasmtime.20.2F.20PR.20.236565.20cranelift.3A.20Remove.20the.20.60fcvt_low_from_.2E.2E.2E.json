This was used by the WebAssembly <code>f64x2.convert_low_i32x4_s</code> instruction previously but the corresponding unsigned variant of the instruction, <code>f64x2.convert_low_i32x4_u</code>, used a <code>uwiden_low</code> plus <code>fcvt_from_uint</code> combo. To help simplify Cranelift's instruction set and to make these two instructions mirrors of each other the Cranelift instruction is removed.</p>\n<p>The s390x and AArch64 backend lowering rules for this instruction could simply be deleted as the previous combination of the <code>swiden_low</code> and <code>fcvt_from_sint</code> lowering rules produces the same code. The x64 backend moved its lowering to a special case of the <code>fcvt_from_sint</code> lowering.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
