I decided to tackle the major refactoring items in this PR, so now the structure looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>winch/src/main</code>: the CLI tool (<code>winch-tools</code>)</li>\n<li><code>winch/codegen</code>: all the code generation pieces (<code>winch-codegen</code>)</li>\n<li><code>crates/winch</code>: the wasmtime integration (<code>winch-wasmtime</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I had a brief battle with the <code>CI/verify-publish</code> job, but I think that I got the handle of the expected structure;  I'd appreciate a verification there (I was thinking maybe @alexcrichton could peek and confirm too).</p>\n</blockquote>",
