This may be useful in some deployment scenarios.</p>\n<p>We don't turn on <code>all-arch</code> by default because it increases build time and binary size of Wasmtime itself, and other embedders of the <code>wasmtime</code> crate won't necessarily want this; hence, we set it only as part of the CI build configuration.</p>\n<p>Fixes #5655.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
