For example, discuss things such as general architecture, use cases, current state of the project, etc. I think the community would greatly benefit from it.</p>\n<p>Let me know if this something you'd be interested in doing. If yes, please feel free to add it to our <a href=\"https://bit.ly/cncf-sig-runtime-meeting-notes\">agenda</a> or reach out to me (raravena80 at <a href=\"http://gmail.com\">gmail.com</a>)</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
