Processing of data is now already shifted to compile time for<br>\nthe wasm module which means that creating a <code>ModuleMemoryImages</code> is<br>\neither cheap because the module is backed by a file on disk, it's a<br>\nsingle <code>write</code> into the kernel to a memfd, or it's cheap as it's not<br>\nsupported. This should help make module instantiation time more<br>\ndeterministic, even for the first instantiation of a module.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
