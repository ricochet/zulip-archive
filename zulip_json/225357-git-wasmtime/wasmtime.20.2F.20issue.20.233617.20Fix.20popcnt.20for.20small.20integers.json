I'll give our new <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/docs/contributing-release-process.md#releasing-a-patch-release\">semi-automated patch release process</a> a try; right now this implies a patch release of Wasmtime as well, which will be a no-op, and we need a better story for just patching Cranelift in the future, but this will do. If there's some unexpected issue and I can't get it out in reasonable time today then the next major release on Jan 5 will include all the changes.</p>\n</blockquote>",
