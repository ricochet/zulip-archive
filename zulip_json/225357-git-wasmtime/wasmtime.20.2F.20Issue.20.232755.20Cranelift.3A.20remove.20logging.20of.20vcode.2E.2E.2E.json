I'm curious: what logging crate did you have in your environment (or was this just in wasmtime)? There was a related issue we found recently that was fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/1247\">tokio-rs/tracing#1247</a>; though if a similar issue occurs with e.g. <code>env_logger</code> then that's good to know too, and we should audit <a href=\"http://regalloc.rs\">regalloc.rs</a> for unnecessary expression evals in tracing!</p>\n</blockquote>",

I was under the impression that the arguments to logging functions were always evaluated but that is not the case. Further investigation shows that @bnjbvr's local logger may be behaving badly which was causing the slowdown here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
