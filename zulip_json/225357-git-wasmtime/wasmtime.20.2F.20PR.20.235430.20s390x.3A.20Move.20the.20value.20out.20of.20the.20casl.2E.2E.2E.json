As such, it no longer makes sense to report moves of registers that aren't virtual to regalloc2, as that would imply that it's acceptable to satisfy a constraint by using a non-allocatable register.</p>\n<p>Fixes #5425 <br>\n&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

It seems the load before loop (loading into %r0) is OK, but the move is problematic (which I understand is because regalloc handles moves specially).</p>\n<p>But is it OK to have a fixed register as source of the bswap instruction?  If so, we wouldn't have to incur this performance regression.  In fact, if <em>only</em> moves are the problem, maybe the fix could be as simple as having a special-cased rule for <code>copy_reg</code> that detects that the source is a fixed register and uses mov_preg instead?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
