These instructions are used for comparisons as well as the <code>{u,s}{min,max}</code> instructions. Alternative lowerings are primarily drawn from LLVM.</p>\n<p>Through this refactoring the x64 backend now has also grown (not the most efficient) lowerings for vector comparisons with <code>i64x2</code> types, which it previously largely didn't have. This enabled copying some non-x86_64 tests into the main test files for various operations.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
