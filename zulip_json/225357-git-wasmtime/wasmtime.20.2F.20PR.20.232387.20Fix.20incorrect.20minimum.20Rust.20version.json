With stable Rust, one can build the <code>wasmtime</code> binary (<code>cargo build</code> in the repository root) and the <code>clif-util</code> binary (<code>cargo build -p cranelift-tools</code>). Core Cranelift crates <code>cranelift-codegen</code>, <code>cranelift-wasm</code> and their dependencies will build on stable Rust.\"? In other words, I don't want to give the impression that nothing at all is usable without nightly.</p>\n<p>Also should we say something about our goals? IIRC @alexcrichton had a related PR recently. Are we working toward only using stable Rust eventually or will we always have some nightly-only crates?</p>\n</blockquote>",
