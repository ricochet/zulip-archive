The issue is that v0.4.* of the <code>openvino</code> crates had to break backwards compatibility (see <a href=\"https://github.com/intel/openvino-rs/releases/tag/v0.4.0\">https://github.com/intel/openvino-rs/releases/tag/v0.4.0</a> for the rationale). If we update the version of OpenVINO used for the script, this error should go away. I have <a href=\"https://github.com/abrown/install-openvino-action\">a GitHub action</a> that should \"do the right thing;\" perhaps we should replace the <code>.github/actions/install-openvino</code> directory with that?</p>\n</blockquote>",
