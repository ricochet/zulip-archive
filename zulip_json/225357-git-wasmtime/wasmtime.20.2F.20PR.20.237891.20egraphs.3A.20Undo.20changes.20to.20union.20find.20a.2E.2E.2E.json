If so we need to be able to quickly evaluate which block is dominated by all the operands, and we can use the pre/post-order intervals as an implementation detail to identify one operand whose block is the right choice using constant-time comparisons.

We just need to compare values according to their associated block's interval, we don't need to compute new intervals or map computed intervals back to blocks. And the block ID for a value is just the block where the value is actually defined, so we can get it from the layout rather than needing to store anything extra per value.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure how to extend this to union nodes, but I'm also not clear on whether we need to answer dominance questions about union nodes. If your sketch of an algorithm is correct about union nodes, Chris, and if I understand it correctly, then the block associated with a union node is whichever block dominates all the values in the eclass identified by that union node. I'm not sure what that tells us.</p>\n<p>By the way, I said this verbally to somebody recently but we should write it down: In the aegraph, every <code>Value</code> identifies an eclass, but some eclasses contain others. It's important to remember that our form of eclass doesn't grow over time, we just may start referring to a different eclass that contains it as a subset. We had quite a bit of confusion about aegraph invariants until we clarified that.</p>\n</blockquote>",

A few thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>SSA dominance implies a <em>partial</em> order on args, at least with respect to block-level dominance; the greatest-lower-bound (where \"top\" is the domtree root) is the highest point at which we can compute the instruction, yep.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I like very much the block-ID rather than interval (and store intervals elsewhere) idea; one more indirection but likely pays for itself with less storage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Re: \"And the block ID for a value is just the block where the value is actually defined, so we can get it from the layout rather than needing to store anything extra per value.\" this is true for blockparams and side-effecting ops, but for pure ops the block ID is the <em>highest</em> block in the domtree at which it <em>could</em> be computed; this may be higher than any block where we actually encounter it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The value for a union node is computed with the opposite merge function as with respect to arguments, because it's a disjunction rather than conjunction. At an operator, we <em>need</em> all the arguments, so we take the lowest subtree that has them all available. But at a union node, we can take any different alternative way to compute the value, so we take the <em>highest</em> subtree that has any available.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last bit is pretty subtle: it wasn't apparent to me at first that this would always work. Consider e.g. block B1 dominating two sub-blocks B2 and B3 in the domtree, and two defs of a value v1, v2 in B2 and v3 in B3 (i.e., v1 = union v2, v3.) Maybe <code>v2</code>'s highest-possible-block is B2 and <code>v3</code>'s highest-possible-block is B3. Should <code>v1</code>'s highest-possible-block be B1? There are no valid ways to compute it there!</p>\n<p>It turns out that the answer is that this can't happen: the highest-possible-block is sort of a max of a set of \"fixed-location\" (impure) inputs, and so the only way for <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> to be in this situation is for them to be functions of blockparams (or e.g. memory loads) in B2 and B3 respectively. But then they shouldn't be in the same eclass -- they are two separate values that never exist at the same time (there is no block that is dominated by both B2 and B3) -- unless the eclass is incomplete and they both e.g. merge to <code>iconst 0</code> (in which case the highest-available-block is the root).</p>\n<p>Said another way, I think the invariant is that all members of an eclass have highest-available-block that lie along a path from some block upward toward the root of the domtree; there is always some unique answer for \"block that dominates all other blocks\" in this set of blocks. That block is what we hope to propagate forward through union nodes.</p>\n</blockquote>",

But I'm going to see if I can write down what we learned anyway.</p>\n<p>As I was writing this I became uncertain that we investigated the right questions, but for reference, the approach we were planning was to filter the result of the <code>gvn_map.get()</code> call in <code>insert_pure_enode</code>. We'd pretend that there was no entry in the map if the value returned was associated with a block that's not dominated by the block associated with the instruction we're trying to look up. (Or maybe it was the other way around, I've already forgotten.) </p>\n<p>I wonder if #7922 might have already fixed the underlying issue that #7879 introduced more <code>subsume</code> uses to work around. (We have not yet tried reverting #7879 on top of main to check that, which we should try since #7922 has landed.)</p>\n<p>The remaining part of this draft PR that was not covered in #7922 is the changes in <code>egraph.rs</code> that undo union-find and gvn-map changes when backtracking up the dominator tree in <code>remove_pure_and_optimize</code>. So we tried to figure out what impact those changes actually have on correctness. To do that, we commented out the line in this PR that says <code>gvn_map = saved_gvn_map</code>, while still leaving <code>self.eclasses = eclasses</code>, and re-ran the filetests. (We had previously tried the other way around, restoring the GVN map but letting the union-find keep growing, and found that all filetests pass.)</p>\n<p>The only test which failed was from <code>cranelift/filetests/filetests/pcc/succeed/opt.clif</code>. Specifically, only the test which is supposed to demonstrate redundant-load elimination failed.</p>\n<p>Side note: this proof-carrying-code RLE test does not appear to test what it was supposed to because the <code>v2</code> load is <code>notrap</code> and never used, so it is deleted by the DCE pass before the egraph even sees it. Neither of the remaining loads is redundant with the other as they're on different branches, so the egraph pass doesn't change the function at all.</p>\n<p>So the bug we see when we undo changes to the union-find but not to the GVN map only occurs when there are two different branches of the dominance tree containing instructions which have equivalent <code>InstructionData</code>. (Apparently we need to write more filetests with this pattern?) When we encounter the second copy of the instruction, <code>insert_pure_enode</code> tries to record in the union-find that it's equivalent to the first copy as found in the GVN map, but the union-find no longer knows that the first copy exists, and <code>panic</code>s because we tried to <code>union</code> with a value that we didn't <code>add</code> first.</p>\n<p>I want to think more carefully about whether this situation can lead to bugs outside of this specific situation (undoing changes to the union-find but not to the GVN map).

This is the unique block, closest to the root of the dominator tree, at which it is legal to place an instruction which computes that value.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For block-parameter values, that is the block where the parameter is defined.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For instruction-result values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the instruction is in the side-effecting skeleton then it's the block where the instruction is located.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, it is the same block as whichever operand is dominated by all the other operands, or the entry block if there are no operands. (We can determine this in time linear in the number of operands by using the constant-time dominance check from <code>DominatorTreePreorder</code>.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For values which represent an eclass by referring to a union node, we're going to establish a new invariant: both parents of the union node must have the same \"available block\", and we'll use that block as the available block of the union node too.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the second piece of this plan is to establish this new invariant. The only time we construct union nodes is in <code>optimize_pure_enode</code>, when we call the ISLE <code>simplify</code> entry-point and union together all the alternatives it gives us. So that's the only place we need to change.</p>\n<p>We'll choose to do it by discarding any alternative with an available block that is strictly dominated by the available block of some other alternative. In other words we choose only alternatives that all have the same available block, where that is the block which is closest, of all the alternatives, to the entry block in the dominator tree. One way to think of this is like an eagerly-evaluated cost function, applied to prune the egraph while we're still building it.</p>\n<p>This is a form of <code>subsume</code> which automatically covers exactly the cases where we currently need <code>subsume</code> for correctness, but does not cover all cases where we currently use <code>subsume</code> for performance. For example, a rule which rewrites <code>isub x, x</code> to <code>iconst 0</code> will only automatically eliminate the <code>isub</code> from later consideration if <code>x</code> is not available in the entry block, where <code>iconst 0</code> is always available. So we might still want <code>subsume</code> annotations even if we don't strictly need them.</p>\n<p>The third piece to consider here is the union-find data structure and the GVN map. There are three general cases where we union values together in the union-find.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When we construct a union node in the <code>DataFlowGraph</code>, we reflect it in the union-find. In this case the new invariant holds in both data structures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When we explicitly <code>subsume</code> a result, we update the union-find to indicate it's in the same eclass as the original expression that we were trying to simplify, as well as any values we looked at earlier in the results from <code>simplify</code>. It's not clear to me that this is okay, so I need to investigate further.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When we hit a matching instruction in either the regular GVN map or the effectful GVN map, we record in the union-find that the results of both instructions should be considered equivalent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the regular GVN map, instructions are considered equivalent if their operands are in the same set in the union-find. So if the union-find sets respect the new invariant on available block, then both versions of the instruction will have the same available block, and unioning their results together will respect the invariant.</li>\n<li>The effectful GVN map can reuse instructions from any dominating block, but their available blocks are the blocks where they're defined, so this can put values with different available blocks into the same set in the union-find, violating the invariant.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So there's at least one hole in this plan that I haven't sorted out yet.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Here's a slightly simpler test case that occurred to me while thinking through this plan.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">test</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">optimize</span>\n<span class=\"n\">set</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">opt_level</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">speed</span>\n<span class=\"n\">target</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">x86_64</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">function</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">%</span><span class=\"n\">bad_reuse</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">i64</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"kt\">i8</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"n\">block0</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">v0</span>: <span class=\"kt\">i64</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>:\n    <span class=\"nc\">brif</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">block1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">block2</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">block1</span>:\n    <span class=\"nc\">v1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">load</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">i64</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">heap</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v0</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">v2</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">isub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v1</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">v3</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">icmp</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">eq</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v2</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">return</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v3</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">block2</span>:\n    <span class=\"nc\">v4</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">iconst</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">i64</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">v5</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">icmp</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">eq</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v4</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">return</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v5</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>When <code>subsume</code> is disabled and the cost model picks the worst alternative, elaboration tries to duplicate the load into <code>block2</code>.

The question is, why is an \"available block\" precise enough, rather than an \"available instruction\"? What if we construct an eclass where one alternative is legal before a <code>load</code> but the other must be placed after the <code>load</code> because it uses its result? Could elaboration ever pick the latter alternative when trying to place it earlier?</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">block0</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">v0</span>: <span class=\"kt\">i64</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"kt\">i64</span>:\n    <span class=\"nc\">v1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">iconst</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">v2</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">load</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v0</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">v3</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">isub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v2</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">return</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v3</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I think the answer is that the load, and any earlier instruction in the side-effecting skeleton, can only reference versions of eclasses which contain values that were originally defined before that instruction. So we can only extract a \"best\" instruction from an eclass that transitively depends on the load when we're elaborating later instructions in the side-effecting skeleton.</p>\n<p>That reasoning only holds now that we merged #7922 though, because before that I think the use of the union-find structure could smuggle later versions of eclasses to earlier instructions during elaboration.</p>\n</blockquote>",
