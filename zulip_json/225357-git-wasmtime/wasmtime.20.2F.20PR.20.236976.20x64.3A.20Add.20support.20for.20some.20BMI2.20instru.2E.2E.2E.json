The shifting instructions can't encode immediates but use a 3-operand form and place no constraints on the amount being shifted by (as opposed to <code>sar</code>-style instructions which require that in <code>%cl</code>). The <code>x</code>-suffixed instructions are prioritized for this reason when BMI2 is enabled so long as an immediate shift amount isn't used. These new instrutions additionally support loading the value-to-shift from memory, unlike the old instructions (they store the result to memory as opposed to the new instructions which store the result in a register), but this functionality is not exposed at this time.</p>\n<p>For <code>rorx</code> the benefits are similar, but the amount being shifted by is required to be an immediate. This means that rotation instructions, either left or right, will unconditionally use <code>rorx</code> so long as the amount-to-rotate is an immediate. This theoretically reduces register allocator pressure since the destination register can be different from the source. </p>\n<p>I'll note that I don't personally have a compelling performance reason for adding these. I was poking around at instruction set extensions awhile back and never got around to making a PR for this until just now.</p>\n</blockquote>",
