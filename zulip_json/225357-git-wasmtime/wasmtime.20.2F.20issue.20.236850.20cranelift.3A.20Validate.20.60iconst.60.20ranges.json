It's nice to confirm that it's detecting the problem that it was supposed to check for!</p>\n<p>That said, I think the way we should fix these tests is by changing the parser for the textual CLIF representation, in <code>cranelift/reader/src/parser.rs</code>.</p>\n<p>The first thing to note is that I believe <code>parse_inst_operands</code> should only be called for an <code>InstructionFormat::UnaryImm</code> if <code>explicit_control_type</code> is not <code>None</code>; I think <code>iconst</code> requires that a type always be provided, and it's the only instruction which uses that instruction format.</p>\n<p>So when parsing operands for that format, we can report a syntax error if that argument is <code>None</code>, and otherwise match on the type to decide whether to call <code>self.match_imm8/16/32</code>. Those return signed types like <code>i8</code>, which needs to be converted to unsigned so it's zero-extended. So something like <code>Imm64::from(self.match_imm8(...) as u8)</code> should check that it fits in range for the appropriate type.</p>\n<p>Does that make sense? Feel free to do that in this PR, or make a separate PR for that change which we'll merge first, either way.</p>\n</blockquote>",

But I think it's hard to prove that there aren't any other situations where a sign-extended 8-bit constant could cause other instructions to produce incorrect results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The general assumption in the s390x back-end is that when holding an <code>i8</code> in a register, the upper bits are undefined and don't-care.  (For example, <code>i8</code> addition uses a 32-bit addition ISA instruction, which will change upper bits.)   From that perspective, using <code>lhi .., -1</code> and <code>lhi .., 255</code> should be equivalent when loading an <code>i8</code> value.  (Also note that <code>lhi</code> only modifies the low 32 bits of the 64-bit register in the first place, the high bits are left unmodified.  So either way this doesn't deterministically set all bits in the full register.)</p>\n<p>As to the caller's expectations, the platform ABI does indeed require all scalar integer types to be zero- or sign-extended to the full register width when passed in registers.  However, this is implemented at the cranelift IR level by using <code>i8 uext</code> or <code>i8 sext</code> as argument or return type, not a plain <code>i8</code>.   (The latter is only used in rare cases like when passing a single-byte struct by value.  In those cases the ABI does indeed state that the upper bits are undefined, so <code>i8</code> correctly represents that semantics.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That said, my guess is that we can just update this test expectation from \"-1\" to \"255\"/\"0xff\" and everything else will be good enough as-is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Agreed.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

If so, we can safely update the test expectation in this PR because only unused bits change. But I wonder if we should change the generated code further for this case? For example, does movw $-1, %cx have a shorter encoding than movl $-1, %ecx, or weird costs? Would it be worth matching on splat of iconst.i16 and precomputing the result of pshuflw as a 32-bit constant, if we have to emit a 32-bit constant anyway? etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@jameysharp:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your assumption is correct: <code>pshuflw</code> reads only the low 16 bits; you could just change the test</li>\n<li>I don't think you're going to get smaller code with a word-<code>mov</code>; it's the same single byte opcode as a doubleword (32 bits in x86)</li>\n<li>I like your idea of changing the codegen: I would just double up the 16-bit constant in the 32-bit <code>mov</code> and then use a single <code>pshufd</code>: for constant <code>a</code>, <code>movl &lt;a&gt;:&lt;a&gt;, %ecx; movd %ecx, %xmm1; pshufd $0, %xmm1, %xmm1</code>. (Another option would be to use a <code>pshufb</code> but then you have to setup a separate <code>xmm</code> register for the mask).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

Looking more carefully, I'm confused by the use of <code>operand_size_of_type_32_64</code> in the <code>imm</code> constructor used by <code>iconst</code>. Why doesn't it use smaller move-from-immediate instructions for smaller types? Is this just to ensure that the upper bits in the register are initialized, or perhaps because nothing else needed smaller operand sizes? <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/62fdafa14ab3e9adb31ac4f26348c939126c4fb9/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/inst.isle#L2568-L2572\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/62fdafa14ab3e9adb31ac4f26348c939126c4fb9/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/inst.isle#L2568-L2572</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
