However, we would absolutely welcome a new contribution of ARM32 support, as long as (i) it starts at a relatively complete state, i.e., is usable to run wasmtime as-is; and (ii) has an active and interested community of contributors willing to help maintain it and resolve issues.</p>\n</blockquote>",
