To that end this commit fixes an issue that the fuzzers have found where calculating the flat type representation was overflowing the stack due to the recursive nature of the implementation.</p>\n<p>The fix here additionally improves upon the previous implementation by caching flat type information per-type instead of recomputing it each time it's queried. This means there's no special need to handle recursion one way or another here and it also greatly improves performance, especially for the <code>fact-valid-module</code> fuzzer. <br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
