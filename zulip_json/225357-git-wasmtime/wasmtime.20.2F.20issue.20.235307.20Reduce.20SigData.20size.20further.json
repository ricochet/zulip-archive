You've shown that every ABI we currently support places that argument at the end, which I think is a pretty good argument for doing this. But we want to support more targets in the future, so maybe we don't want to over-simplify this detail? On the other hand, we can always change this again if we ever find a target that doesn't put the stack ret arg at the end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The position shouldn't matter I think. Only the register assignment.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We aren't comfortable hard-coding the assumption that <code>stack_return_arg</code> is always last right now. (@bjorn3, you're right that the register assignment is all that matters, but as I understand it the register assignment gets computed from this list, so order still matters.)</p>\n<p>So @tnachen, could you remove the <code>stack_return_arg</code> changes from this PR? I want to merge the rest of the work you did here. Let me know whether you want to try de-duplicating the <code>args_start</code> fields in this PR, or if I should merge this and you can open another PR. I would recommend opening another PR for that unless you feel you can do it within a day or two, just so we can get the work you've already done merged promptly.</p>\n</blockquote>",
