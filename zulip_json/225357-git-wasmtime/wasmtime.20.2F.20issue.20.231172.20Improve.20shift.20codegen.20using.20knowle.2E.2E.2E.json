This is extra work that could be removed if we had knowledge that the shift value was constant and in the required range. This knowledge could also be used to lower the Wasm shifts to instructions using an immediate.</p>\n<h4>What is the value of adding this in Cranelift?</h4>\n<p>Emit faster code.</p>\n<h4>Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or algorithms to use?</h4>\n<p>I think this type of optimization may apply to more than just Wasm shifts so I hope this approach works for those as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add an <code>is_constant(v: Value)</code> function to <code>DataFlowGraph</code>; initially this could check if the value passed was created by one of the following instructions: <code>iconst</code>, <code>fconst</code>, <code>bconst</code>, <code>vconst</code>. This could get more complex later but I feel this simple implementation would be a good start.</li>\n<li>in <code>code_translator.rs</code>, check if the shift value <code>is_constant</code> and if it also inside the expected range (e.g. 0-31), lower the Wasm shift to <code>ish*_imm</code>; otherwise, lower to <code>ish*</code> as is done currently.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they better or worse than your proposal?</h4>\n<p>No, open to suggestions.</p>\n</blockquote>",
