The<br>\nmotivation for this came about when I was updating dependencies and saw<br>\nthat <code>region</code> had a new major version at 3.0.0 as opposed to our<br>\ncurrently used 2.3 track. In reviewing the use cases of <code>region</code> within<br>\nWasmtime I found two trends in particular which motivated this commit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Some unix-specific areas of <code>wasmtime_runtime</code> use<br>\n<code>rustix::mm::mprotect</code> instead of <code>region::protect</code> already. This<br>\n  means that the usage of <code>region::protect</code> for changing virtual memory<br>\n  protections was already inconsistent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Many uses of <code>region::protect</code> were already in unix-specific regions<br>\n  which could make use of <code>rustix</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall I opted to remove the dependency on the <code>region</code> crate to avoid<br>\nchasing its versions over time. Unix-specific changes of protections<br>\nwere easily changed to <code>rustix::mm::mprotect</code>. There were two locations<br>\nwhere a windows/unix split is now required and I subjectively ruled<br>\n\"that seems ok\". Finally removing <code>region</code> also meant that the \"what is<br>\nthe current page size\" query needed to be inlined into<br>\n<code>wasmtime_runtime</code>, which I have also subjectively ruled \"that seems<br>\nfine\".</p>\n<p>Finally one final refactoring here was that the <code>unix.rs</code> and <code>linux.rs</code><br>\nsplit for the pooling allocator was merged. These two files already only<br>\ndiffered in one function so I slapped a <code>cfg_if!</code> in there to help<br>\nreduce the duplication.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
