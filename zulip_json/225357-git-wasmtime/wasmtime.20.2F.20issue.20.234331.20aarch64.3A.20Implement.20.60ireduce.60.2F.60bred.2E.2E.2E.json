Let's ignore the issue of boolean vectors and just look at <code>ireduce</code> - that operation is still problematic because of cases such as reductions from <code>I62X2</code> to <code>I8X2</code>; on the other hand, as far as I can tell there are neither implementations nor tests of the vector variants. Should we just restrict the IR operation definitions to scalars?</p>\n<p>cc @abrown @cfallin</p>\n</blockquote>",
