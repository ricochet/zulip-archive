On bz2, pulldown-cmark, and spidermonkey, there's no significant difference between this PR at e1d2f515b and main at 2d25db047, except in compilation speed, where this PR seems to be faster (by &lt;1%) for no obvious reason. (There are a few extra commits on the version of <code>main</code> that I compared against, so it's possible one of those slowed compilation down.)</p>\n<p>I'm going ahead and merging this. These are good rewrites even if they don't happen to help these particular benchmarks, after all.</p>\n</blockquote>",
