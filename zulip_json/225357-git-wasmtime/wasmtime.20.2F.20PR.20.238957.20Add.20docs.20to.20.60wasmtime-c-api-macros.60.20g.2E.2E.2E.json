The upstream wasm-c-api proposal to wasm has been largely inactive for quite some time now and AFAIK there's not much drive/push to revinvigorate it or keep it going. In that sense the best option would be to probably open an issue on the repository itself.</p>\n<p>If I had to hazard a guess, I believe that the intention was that all pointer-lookalike-things could be turned into generic references which could then be converted back out at some point. I believe the original goal was to eventually unify the wasm type system itself to allow passing around first-class-references to more than just functions but also tables/memories/etc. In the interim time I don't believe that's panned out and in Wasmtime we don't implement any of these because they don't actually map to internals of Wasmtime.</p>\n<p>AFAIK there also hasn't been much usage of the wasm-c-api header file as a means of integrating with a wasm engine. All usage I've seen additionally requires implementation-specific APIs (e.g. <code>wasmtime_*</code> in the Wasmtime C API). Many out-of-browser engines I've seen also don't implement this API as well. </p>\n<p>Overall I don't think things are in a state where it's expected someone can walk in and see a vibrant and well documented ecosystem of engines and users all interoperating with this API. I believe that was an original goal, but it hasn't quite panned out.</p>\n</blockquote>",
