This notably remove the atomics-specifics paths<br>\nas well as the <code>prepare_load</code> function (now renamed to <code>prepare_addr</code><br>\nand folded into <code>get_heap_addr</code>).</p>\n<p>The goal of this commit is to simplify how addresses are managed in the<br>\ncode generator for atomics to use all the shared infrastrucutre of other<br>\nloads/stores as well. This additionally fixes #3132 via the use of<br>\n<code>heap_addr</code> in clif for all operations.</p>\n<p>I also added a number of tests for loads/stores with varying alignments.<br>\nOriginally I was going to allow loads/stores to not be aligned since<br>\nthat's what the current formal specification says, but the overview of<br>\nthe threads proposal disagrees with the formal specification, so I<br>\nfigured I'd leave it as-is but adding tests probably doesn't hurt.</p>\n<p>Closes #3132</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
