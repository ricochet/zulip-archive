I think these rules might still be correct on vector types; I believe <code>icmp</code> returns 0 or -1 in each lane, and I think <code>bitselect</code> is defined on vectors.</p>\n<p>On scalar types I think we could have a rule rewriting <code>(bitselect ty (bmask ty c) x y)</code> to <code>(select ty c x y)</code>. That would give us a correct version of these <code>bitselect</code> rules in terms of the rules for <code>select</code>, and also be useful in its own right.</p>\n</blockquote>",

These rules were sort of correct before we removed <code>vselect</code> in #5918. That instruction only applied to vectors, so replacing it with <code>bitselect</code> was correct except that the \"only vectors\" constraint was lost at that point.</p>\n<p>Our current way to express that a type is any vector type is to match it against <code>(multi_lane _ _)</code>. Adding that constraint to all these rules should fix this.</p>\n<p>The <code>bitselect</code> instruction is useful on scalar values too. It's just that this particular transformation was wrong for scalars.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It's nice that 8.0.0 hasn't been released yet. Thanks for spotting this bug, @Kmeakin!</p>\n</blockquote>",
