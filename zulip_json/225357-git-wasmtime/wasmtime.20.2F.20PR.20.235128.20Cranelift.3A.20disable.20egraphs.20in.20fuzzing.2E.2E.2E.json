Rather than chase these down then refactor later, it probably makes sense not to spend the human time or fuzzing time doing so. This PR turns off egraphs support in fuzzing configurations for now, to be re-enabled later.</p>\n<p>[this comment]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5126#issuecomment-1291222515\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5126#issuecomment-1291222515</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
