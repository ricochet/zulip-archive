I can understand it for <code>flat_count</code> since the canonical ABI defines <code>MAX_FLAT_PARAMS = 16</code>, although I think that's worth a comment somewhere. I'm less sold on it for <code>FlagsSize</code>: although 8,160 flags \"ought to be good enough for anybody\", is there a reason to limit it to that?</p>\n</blockquote>",

The flat count has no need to be bigger than u8, but flags may be bigger than u8 if, as you mention, there's 80k+ flags. Given that <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/blob/ad7c96d42f821e4db75eb0631aef4dbccc10956a/crates/wasmparser/src/limits.rs#L46\">wasmparser already has a hardcoded limit of 1000 flags</a> I didn't see much need to try and improve the situation.</p>\n</blockquote>",
