I took the most trivial path to implement it via futures::poll_immediate. I had to add a minor optimization to the clock deadline future so that we can test it by asserting <code>subscribe_duration(0).ready()</code> and <code>subscribe_instant(now() - 1).ready()</code> are true.</p>\n</blockquote>",
