To avoid any subtle future bugs here the optimization is removed, and if needed in the future it's hoped by that point it's either easier to add back in or it's more clear why the maintenance burden should be required.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
