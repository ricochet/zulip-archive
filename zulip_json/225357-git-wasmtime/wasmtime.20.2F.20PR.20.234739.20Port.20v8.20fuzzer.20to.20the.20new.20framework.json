This PR includes features such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The V8 differential execution is migrated to the new framework.</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Config::set_differential_config</code> no longer force-disables wasm<br>\n  features, instead allowing them to be enabled as per the fuzz input.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>DiffInstance::{hash, hash}</code> was replaced with<br>\n<code>DiffInstance::get_{memory,global}</code> to allow more fine-grained<br>\n  assertions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support for <code>FuncRef</code> and <code>ExternRef</code> have been added to <code>DiffValue</code><br>\n  and <code>DiffValueType</code>. For now though generating an arbitrary<br>\n<code>ExternRef</code> and <code>FuncRef</code> simply generates a null value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Arbitrary <code>DiffValue::{F32,F64}</code> values are guaranteed to use<br>\n  canonical NaN representations to fix an issue with v8 where with the<br>\n  v8 engine we can't communicate non-canonical NaN values through JS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>DiffEngine::evaluate</code> allows \"successful failure\" for cases where<br>\n  engines can't support that particular invocation, for example v8 can't<br>\n  support <code>v128</code> arguments or return values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Smoke tests were added for each engine to ensure that a simple wasm<br>\n  module works at PR-time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Statistics printed from the main fuzzer now include percentage-rates<br>\n  for chosen engines as well as percentage rates for styles-of-module.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's also a few small refactorings here and there but mostly just<br>\nthings I saw along the way.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so. The list of<br>\n  suggested reviewers on the right can help you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please ensure all communication adheres to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">code of\nconduct</a>.<br>\n--&gt;<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
