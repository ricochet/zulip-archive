But I somehow feel like calling <code>linker.instantiate(&amp;module)</code> automatically calling <code>_initialize</code> would make sense… or maybe add a mandatory argument so people must express the choice of whether they want their module to be initialized at instantiation time or not, and at least know they have to do it manually if they want not to?</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Keep the statu quo, ie. let the user call <code>_initialize</code> manually. IMO that would require much more documentation about the topic, though it's definitely a possibility too.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all you do on wasm and the surrounding ecosystem! <span aria-label=\"heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-2764\" role=\"img\" title=\"heart\">:heart:</span> </p>\n</blockquote>",
