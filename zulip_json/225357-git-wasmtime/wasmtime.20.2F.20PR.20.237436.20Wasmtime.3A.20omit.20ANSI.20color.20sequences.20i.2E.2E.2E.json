It included logic to add ANSI color sequences when stderr is a terminal, for legibility. Unfortunately it seems that while this logic <em>enabled</em> colors on a terminal, it did not <em>disable</em> colors on a non-terminal; so redirects of stderr to a file would result in ANSI color sequences being captured in that file. Specifically, the builder seems not to default to no-color; so rather than enable-or-nothing, we should explicitly enable or disable always.</p>\n<p>Fixes #7435.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
