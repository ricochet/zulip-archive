Turns out with Pulley now being online the fuzzer quickly found a difference between Pulley and Cranelift where the native x64 instructions differ from the \"deterministic\" behavior that Pulley implements. This difference is expected and allowed though, so don't fuzz it.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
