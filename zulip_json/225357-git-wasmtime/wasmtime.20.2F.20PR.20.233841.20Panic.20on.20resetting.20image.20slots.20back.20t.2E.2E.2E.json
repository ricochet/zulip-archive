On reading<br>\nsome of this code again for a different change I realized that if an<br>\nerror happens in <code>reset_with_anon_memory</code> it would be possible,<br>\ndepending on where another error happened, to leak memory from one image<br>\nto another.</p>\n<p>For example if <code>clear_and_remain_ready</code> failed its <code>madvise</code> (for<br>\nwhatever reason) and didn't actually reset any memory, then if <code>Drop for\nMemoryImageSlot</code> also hit an error trying to remap memory (for whatever<br>\nreason), then nothing about memory has changed and when the<br>\n<code>MemoryImageSlot</code> is recreated it'll think that it's 0-length when<br>\nactually it's a bit larger and may leak data.</p>\n<p>I don't think this is a serious problem since we don't know any<br>\nsituation under which the <code>madvise</code> would fail and/or the resetting with<br>\nanonymous memory, but given that these aren't expected to fail I figure<br>\nit's best to be a bit more defensive here and/or loud about failures.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
