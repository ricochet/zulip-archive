Making use of a magic value for \"rank\" is a clever way to get this behavior almost for free out of an otherwise-standard union-find implementation.</p>\n<p>I agree with @fitzgen that it feels unsatisfying to have the case of merging two pinned IDs just print a warning. But it's better than the _status quo_ where we get the same result without any indication that something went wrong.</p>\n<p>At worst, this PR would be a good starting point for evaluating how often we have this problem in practice. My guess is we don't see #6126 come up very often in normal use of Cranelift, in which case it's good that this PR is a very small change, algorithmically speaking. But maybe my guess is wrong and it'd be nice to discover that.</p>\n<p>I would also be interested to know what fraction of nodes in the union-find do _not_ get pinned with this PR. If we pinned everything before merging, this approach would just warn on every merge. If we merge things and then pin them afterward though, that's fine. I can't really focus right now to picture how this works out but it'd be nice to develop a better understanding.</p>\n<p>@meithecatte, if you're using Linux and want lower-variance performance measurements, I've documented the rather extreme measures I use to <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/sightglass/blob/main/docs/cpu-isolation.md\">isolate a CPU core for benchmarks</a>. You don't need performance measurements to justify merging this PR, but if there's a measurable improvement, that's definitely a nice extra argument in favor.</p>\n</blockquote>",

As @fitzgen noted, I'm still on parental leave until Feb 12 so I can't review anything properly until then, but I'm watching email and will try not to block things when my input is useful!</p>\n<p>I'd agree that this is generally a good approach, with the caveat that we <em>must not</em> warn, and especially not debug-assert, if two pinned values are union'd. As @meithecatte noted, analyzing the rules to prove this can't occur is a hard problem and above the abstraction level we likely want to work at. This case <em>shouldn't</em> happen in normal use (values numbered sequentially as built, rules generally rewriting toward better expressions), but compilation is still correct if it does happen (as noted in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6126#issuecomment-1490776800\">this comment</a> that @meithecatte linked), and moreover the entire point of aegraphs is to approximate egraphs with lower cost -- this means that we can expect suboptimal outcomes in some cases (this is the price we pay for no fixpoint loop).</p>\n<p>So, since it can happen in normal operation, and is not incorrect, we must not panic (even in a debug build), and we probably shouldn't warn -- that has the potential to create a log-storm issue at the most inopportune time (e.g. a DoS vector in production where the compiler was happy before). My vote would be to choose the lower ID to break the tie, as we do today, but either choice should be valid I think.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Perhaps something like the Linux kernel's <code>WARN_ONCE</code>?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My vote would be to choose the lower ID to break the tie, as we do today, but either choice should be valid I think.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps it indeed makes sense to use this as a heuristic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'd agree that this is generally a good approach, with the caveat that we must not warn, and especially not debug-assert, if two pinned values are union'd. As @meithecatte noted, analyzing the rules to prove this can't occur is a hard problem and above the abstraction level we likely want to work at. This case shouldn't happen in normal use (values numbered sequentially as built, rules generally rewriting toward better expressions), but compilation is still correct if it does happen (as noted in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6126#issuecomment-1490776800\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6126#issuecomment-1490776800</a> that @meithecatte linked), and moreover the entire point of aegraphs is to approximate egraphs with lower cost -- this means that we can expect suboptimal outcomes in some cases (this is the price we pay for no fixpoint loop).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, though I'd argue that this case triggering would <em>probably</em> mean that there's a reasonable rewrite rule that we haven't implemented. I don't know about you, but I'd like to know if it happened.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't know about you, but I'd like to know if it happened.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, agreed it would be nice to get this information! In my mind, it looks more like a \"compiler stat\", like a regalloc spill, or a worst-case fallback isel rule firing: regrettable, but not rising to the level of <code>warn!</code>. Remember that we have a lot of embedders of <code>wasmtime</code> in, e.g., server runtimes and game engines and such, and folks may, e.g., pipe warnings to devops folks (Slack channels and such); an \"I should address this\" missing optimization to the compiler engineer is a far cry from a \"disk is almost full\" or \"frame dropped\" message or something like that.</p>\n<p>Or another way perhaps: it is an <em>implementation quality</em> signal rather than a <em>runtime urgency</em> signal. Warnings should occur when the person operating the software might want to take some action, not when the compiler engineer might want to add an optimization.</p>\n<p>We have a nascent \"stats framework\" idea, which appears in the aegraphs framework and in regalloc2 as well; perhaps \"two pinned values union'd\" is another stat event and whenever we go fishing for optimization work to do, we notice if the value is nonzero?</p>\n</blockquote>",
