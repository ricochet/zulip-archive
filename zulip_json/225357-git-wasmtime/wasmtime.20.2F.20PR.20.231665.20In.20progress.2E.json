So you'd drop the <code>Scalar</code> bit here, giving <code>SSE_Mov_R_R</code>.

Yes.  True.  Nevertheless, the general flavour of the rest of the instruction selector (<a href=\"http://lower.rs\" title=\"http://lower.rs\">lower.rs</a>) is that we keep int and vec instructions separate, and we don't hand that problem to the instruction-representation layer.  So the lowering logic to handle <code>Opcode::FallthroughReturn | Opcode::Return</code> will need to do the type test itself, rather than handing it off to <code>return_mov_r_r</code>.  FWIW I think there are only very few places like this, where we need to check int-vs-vec/float types at the lowering level -- in prologue construction is the only other place I can think of.</p>\n</blockquote>",
