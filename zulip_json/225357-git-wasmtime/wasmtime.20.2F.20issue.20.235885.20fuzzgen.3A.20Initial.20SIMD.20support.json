So let's go with it and maybe we can figure something better out later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sounds good. I'm happy to iterate on this syntax as well. From what I've read of the parser we support a few different forms:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">const0</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">i32x4</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">0x0123456</span><span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"p\">.</span>\n<span class=\"n\">const1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">i64x2</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">const2</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mh\">0x00</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">0x01</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">0x02</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is pre-this-pr, I've only changed the <code>const2</code> syntax into big hex. Ideally we could print the <code>const1</code> format, but that one does require us knowing the type of the const data. Which I don't think we have when printing the CLIF back out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm eager to get the codegen-meta all-opcodes fuzzing stuff going, but I'd still be happy to approve PRs adding more ops to the existing table. I'd like to have as much coverage from fuzzing as possible</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, that makes sense! I'm going to review whats already supported in the interpreter and add those ops to the fuzzer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and I expect it's going to be tricky to get the code-generated version working, so I'm assuming we won't finish that soon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last I looked into it, I ran into some kind of blocker, but I don't actually remember what it was. I'll need to go look into it again.</p>\n</blockquote>",
