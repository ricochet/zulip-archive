It would be returned by this function, and it would need to be updated by the functions below to take into account the offset sizes. This would have the benefit of storing less bytes in the <code>emitted</code> vector, so it'd be more efficient and would make the tests run faster (no need for resizing, for instance).</p>\n</blockquote>",
