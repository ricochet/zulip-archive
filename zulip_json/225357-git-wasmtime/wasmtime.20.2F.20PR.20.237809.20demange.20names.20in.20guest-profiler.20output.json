We have another <code>unwrap</code> on the use of this function in <code>CompiledModule::register_debug_and_profiling</code>, anyway.</p>\n<p>While looking at that, I just noticed that there's a <code>demangle_function_name_or_index</code> function which is very similar to what this whole <code>match</code> statement does. I think it's harmless to duplicate that here, with a slightly different format for the fallback case when there's no function name.</p>\n<p>I'm going to merge this as-is. But if you want to open a follow-up PR, I think it would be an improvement to use <code>demangle_function_name_or_index</code> here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
