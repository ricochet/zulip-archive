The WasiCtxBuilder is the only way to customize its contents. We don't want to let users modify the fields of WasiCtx after it has been used by a wasm guest, because the guest may have made assumptions that fields won't change - e.g. the stderr field is fetched once by the adapter and assumed to always be the same, environment variables are copied into libc once and assumed to always be the same.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
