This is required for safety when using wasm modules, however, so it's not something that we can fix. Host functions can be called recursively if they, for example, reenter wasm and then get called again.</p>\n<p>You can get mutation through interior mutability in Rust, however, for example through <code>RefCell</code> or <code>Cell</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
