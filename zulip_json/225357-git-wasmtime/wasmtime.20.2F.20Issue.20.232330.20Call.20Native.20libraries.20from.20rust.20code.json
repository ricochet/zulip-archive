You will have to use a C wrapper if you want to call it from an other language.</p>\n<p>Is this a feature request for Cranelift or Wasmtime? Are you a user of the Cranelift code generator and do you want to use native libraries from code you compiled using it? This is already possible. Or do you want to use native libraries from code compiled to wasm? This will never be possible. Wasm runs in a VM. This VM is only capable of addressing 4GB of memory, which is only a small chunk of the full address space on 64bit architectures. This means that if a native library returns a pointer outside this small chunk of memory, which it should as Wasmtime reserves the full 4GB of address space, then it isn't possible for the wasm code to access it. In addition the memory layout and call conv of the wasm code is very likely different that of the architecture you are running Wasmtime on. And that doesn't even account for the security issues with this. If you don't care about the security issues, then why are you using wasm instead of compiling to native code?</p>\n<p>What is possible is to write a program that embeds wasmtime and exports safe interfaces for the functions you want to use to the wasm code.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Ok, so where can I find documentation about exposing interfaces and interop between them? <br>\nFinally I tried making a simple Gtk app using wastime but it failed to build gtk-sys, now I understand why, thanks </p>\n</blockquote>",

For binding native APIs in C++ you'll probably, as @bjorn3 mentioned, want to make a C wrapper that you can call from the native Rust code. Then you can create a <code>Func</code> for each piece of functionality you'd like to expose to wasm. It'd be up to you what the APIs look like and how  data is transferred across the boundary. The various examples in this repository should help you get started!</p>\n</blockquote>",
