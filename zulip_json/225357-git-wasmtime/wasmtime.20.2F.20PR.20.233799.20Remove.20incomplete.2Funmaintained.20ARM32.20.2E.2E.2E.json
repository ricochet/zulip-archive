Currently, this backend supports only 32-bit types, which is<br>\ninsufficient for full Wasm-MVP; it's missing other critical bits, like<br>\nfloating-point support; and it has only ever been exercised, AFAIK, via<br>\nthe filetests for the individual CLIF instructions that are implemented.</p>\n<p>We were very very thankful for the original contribution of this<br>\nbackend, even in its partial state, and we had hoped at the time that we<br>\ncould eventually mature it in-tree until it supported e.g. Wasm and<br>\nother use-cases. But that hasn't yet happened -- to the blame of no-one,<br>\nto be clear, we just haven't had a contributor with sufficient time.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the existence of the backend and lack of active<br>\nmaintainer now potentially pose a bit of a burden as we hope to make<br>\ncontinuing changes to the backend framework. For example, the ISLE<br>\nmigration, and the use of regalloc2 that it will allow, would need all<br>\nof the existing lowering patterns in the hand-written ARM32 backend to<br>\nbe rewritten as ISLE rules.</p>\n<p>Given that we don't currently have the resources to do this, we think<br>\nit's probably best if we, sadly, for now remove this partial backend.<br>\nThis is not in any way a statement of what we might accept in the<br>\nfuture, though. If, in the future, an ARM32 backend updated to our<br>\nlatest codebase with an active maintainer were to appear, we'd be happy<br>\nto merge it (and likewise for any other architecture!). But for now,<br>\nthis is probably the best path. Thanks again to the original contributor<br>\n@jmkrauz and we hope that this work can eventually be brought back and<br>\nreused if someone has the time to do so!</p>\n<p>Closes #3721.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
