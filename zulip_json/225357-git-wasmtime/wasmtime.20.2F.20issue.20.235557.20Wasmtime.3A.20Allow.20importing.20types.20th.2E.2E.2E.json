I definitely agree that the widespread use of <code>wasm-bindgen</code> clashes with Wasmtime and out-of-browser environments. As one of the primary authors of <code>wasm-bindgen</code>, however, I don't think that this would be a good idea.</p>\n<p>\"Support <code>wasm-bindgen</code> outside of a browser\" would basically involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hard-code <code>wasm-bindgen</code>'s bespoke, nonstandard, and project-specific method of binding to web APIs. This is highly dependent on the <code>wasm-bindgen</code> crate version and changes over time, there's no stability here.</li>\n<li>Implement all browser APIs in Wasmtime, natively. Naturally this is a sisyphean task for not really all that much benefit, for example what does it mean to create a DOM node in an out-of-browser environment?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Neither of these fundamental pillars of supporting <code>wasm-bindgen</code> make sense to implement in Wasmtime, in my opinion.</p>\n<p>Again though I don't disagree that there's pain here in mixing browser and out-of-browser environment but I don't believe unifying the environments is a solution. Instead I think it would be better to be clearer and more consistent about what code compiles where and where it runs. This is also a very difficult question and isn't necessarily all that much easier than the above, but it's more scalable into the future I believe.</p>\n</blockquote>",
