The hope is that these newer images, being natively M1 machines, are faster to compile and less flaky. A number of CI builds recently have failed due to seeming CI issues with the older machines, so this'll hopefully keep the same amount of testing while improving robustness.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
