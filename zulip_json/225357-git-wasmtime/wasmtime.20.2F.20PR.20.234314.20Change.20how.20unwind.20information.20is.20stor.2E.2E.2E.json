The<br>\nfirst location is the unwind information itself which corresponds to<br>\n<code>UNWIND_INFO</code>. The second location is a list of <code>RUNTIME_INFO</code><br>\nstructures which point to function bodes and <code>UNWIND_INFO</code> structures.</p>\n<p>Currently in Wasmtime the <code>UNWIND_INFO</code> structures are stored just after<br>\nfunctions themselves with a somewhat cryptic comment indicating that<br>\nWindows prefers this (I'm unsure as to the provenance of this comment).<br>\nThe <code>RUNTIME_INFO</code> data is then stored in a separate section which has<br>\nthe custom name of <code>_wasmtime_winx64_unwind</code>.</p>\n<p>After my recent foray into trying to debug windows-2022 bad unwind<br>\ninformation again I realized though that Windows actually has official<br>\nsections for these two unwind information items. The <code>.xdata</code> section is<br>\nused to store the <code>UNWIND_INFO</code> structures and the <code>.pdata</code> section<br>\nstores the <code>RUNTIME_INFO</code> list. To try to be somewhat idiomatic and<br>\nperhaps one day even hook into standard Windows debugging tools I went<br>\nahead and refactored how our unwind information is stored to match this.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the main benefit of this is that it reduces the size of the<br>\nread/execute section of the binary. Previously the unwind information<br>\nwas executable since it was stored in the <code>.text</code> section, but<br>\nunnecessarily so. Now it's in a read-only section which is in theory a<br>\nsmall amount of hardening.</p>\n<p>Otherwise though I don't think this will really help all that much to<br>\nhook up in to standard debugging tools like <code>objdump</code> because it's all<br>\nstill stored in an ELF file rather than a COFF file.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
