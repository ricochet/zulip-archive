And uses <code>cfg</code>'s to disable ops instead of commenting them out, this makes it easier to run fuzzgen on a new arch by enabling all ops by default until we know they are broken.</p>\n<p>Also changes inputs for x86 since we enable <code>icmp.i128</code> for some IntCC's which were previously all disabled.</p>\n<p>This ran for about an hour on x86 and aarch64 without crashing. (In conjunction with <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4866\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4866</a> for aarch64)</p>\n</blockquote>",
