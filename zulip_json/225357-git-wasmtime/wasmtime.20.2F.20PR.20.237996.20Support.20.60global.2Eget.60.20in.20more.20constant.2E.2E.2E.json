Pre-reference-types this never came up because there was no valid <code>global.get</code> that would typecheck. After the reference-types proposal landed however this became possible but Wasmtime did not support it. This was surfaced in #6705 when the spec test suite was updated and has a new test that exercises this functionality.</p>\n<p>This commit both updates the spec test suite and additionally adds support for this new form of element segment and table initialization expression.</p>\n<p>The fact that Wasmtime hasn't supported this until now also means that we have a gap in our fuzz-testing infrastructure. The <code>wasm-smith</code> generator is being updated in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/issues/1426\">bytecodealliance/wasm-tools#1426</a> to generate modules with this particular feature and I've tested that with that PR fuzzing here eventually generates an error before this PR.</p>\n<p>Closes #6705</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
