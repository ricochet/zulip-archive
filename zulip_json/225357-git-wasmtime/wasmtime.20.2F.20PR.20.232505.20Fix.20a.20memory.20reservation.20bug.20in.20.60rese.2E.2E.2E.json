Unfortunately <code>results.reserve(nmodules)</code> isn't enough here<br>\nbecause this can be called many times before a module is actually<br>\nfinished and pushed onto the vector. The attempted logic to work around<br>\nthis was buggy, however, and would simply trigger geometric growth on<br>\nevery single reservation because it erroneously assumed that a<br>\nreservation would be exactly met.</p>\n<p>This is fixed by avoiding looking at the vector's capacity and instead<br>\nkeeping track of modules-to-be in a side field. This is the incremented<br>\nand passed to <code>reserve</code> as it represents the number of modules that will<br>\neventually make their way into the result vector.</p>\n</blockquote>",
