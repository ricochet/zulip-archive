Since Wiggle was written under the assumption of single-threaded guest-side access, this change introduces a <code>shared</code> field to guest memories in order to flag when this assumption will not be the case. This change always sets <code>shared</code> to <code>false</code>; once a few more pieces are in place, <code>shared</code> will be set dynamically when a shared memory is detected, e.g., in a change like #5054.</p>\n<p>Using the <code>shared</code> field, we can now decide to load Wiggle values differently under the new assumptions. This change  makes the guest <code>T::read</code> and <code>T::write</code> calls into <code>Relaxed</code> atomic loads and stores in order to maintain WebAssembly's expected memory consistency guarantees. We choose Rust's <code>Relaxed</code> here to match the <code>Unordered</code> memory consistency described in the [memory model] section of the ECMA spec.</p>\n<p>[memory model]: <a href=\"https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/memory-model.html#sec-memory-model\">https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/memory-model.html#sec-memory-model</a></p>\n<p>Since 128-bit scalar types do not have <code>Atomic*</code> equivalents, we remove their <code>T::read</code> and <code>T::write</code> implementations here. They are unused by any WASI implementations in the project.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
