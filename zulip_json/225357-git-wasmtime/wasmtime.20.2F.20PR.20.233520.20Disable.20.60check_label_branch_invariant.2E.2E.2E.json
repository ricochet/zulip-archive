Fuzzing leads to a 20-30x slowdown of executed code and<br>\nlocally the fuzz time it takes to instantiate #3441 drops from 3 minutes<br>\nto 6 seconds disabling this function. Note that this should still be<br>\nexecuted during our testing on CI since it's still enabled for debug<br>\nassertions.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
