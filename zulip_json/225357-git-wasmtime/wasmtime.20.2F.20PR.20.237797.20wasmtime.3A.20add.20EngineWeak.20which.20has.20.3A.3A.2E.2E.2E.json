If instead the worker thread holds an <code>EngineWeak</code>, it can stop ticking when all consumers of the <code>Engine</code> have dropped it. This has been documented as a suggestion in <code>increment_epoch</code>.</p>\n<p>For an example of additional machinery which is simplified by this change, see <a href=\"https://github.com/fastly/Viceroy/blob/25edee0700ec0b20b1b56db0a3a8d6f090397b3a/lib/src/execute.rs#L108-L116\">https://github.com/fastly/Viceroy/blob/25edee0700ec0b20b1b56db0a3a8d6f090397b3a/lib/src/execute.rs#L108-L116</a>)</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
