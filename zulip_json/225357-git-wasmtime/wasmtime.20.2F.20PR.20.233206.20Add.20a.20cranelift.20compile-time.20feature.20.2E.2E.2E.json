This<br>\nbubbles up to disable APIs such as <code>Module::new</code>, <code>Func::new</code>,<br>\n<code>Engine::precompile_module</code>, and a number of <code>Config</code> methods affecting<br>\ncompiler configuration. Checks are added to CI that when built in this<br>\nmode Wasmtime continues to successfully build. It's hoped that although<br>\nthis is effectively \"sprinkle <code>#[cfg]</code> until things compile\" this won't<br>\nbe too too bad to maintain over time since it's also an use case we're<br>\ninterested in supporting.</p>\n<p>With <code>cranelift</code> disabled the only way to create a <code>Module</code> is with the<br>\n<code>Module::deserialize</code> method, which requires some form of precompiled<br>\nartifact.</p>\n<p>Two consequences of this change are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>Module::serialize</code> is also disabled in this mode. The reason for this<br>\n  is that serialized modules contain ISA/shared flags encoded in them<br>\n  which were used to produce the compiled code. There's no storage for<br>\n  this if compilation is disabled. This could probably be re-enabled in<br>\n  the future if necessary, but it may not end up being all that necessary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deserialized modules are not checked to ensure that their ISA/shared<br>\n  flags are compatible with the host CPU. This is actually already the<br>\n  case, though, with normal modules. We'll likely want to fix this in<br>\n  the future using a shared implementation for both these locations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Documentation should be updated to indicate that <code>cranelift</code> can be<br>\ndisabled, although it's not really the most prominent documentation<br>\nbecause this is expected to be a somewhat niche use case (albeit<br>\nimportant, just not too common).</p>\n</blockquote>",
