Unfortunately there's still a nontrivial diff, I guess I had hoped for a little more investigation to point to exactly what the microarchitectural difference was; take the two inner loops, transform one into the other one step at a time, see where the cliff happens, that sort of thing. To be more direct: most folks here (at least those working on Cranelift full-time) don't have time to dig into a performance anomaly of several hundred lines of assembly with unclear prioritization (i.e., found via fuzzing rather than via real-use-case report) so for this effort to be successful you'll have to do a little more of the investigation yourself and point to what we can change.

can reduce the input wasm program down - if the program were 30 instructions and switching the constant from 0 to 1 still produces significantly different codegen, that's much easier to investigate.</p>\n</blockquote>",

That's not a \"wrong analysis\", that's just an optimization we haven't implemented yet (and it's somewhat nontrivial to do in our egraph mid-end, though we have ideas). It's entirely possible that that could cascade into other optimizations (GVN, ...?) applying or not applying, causing more register pressure and the spills you're seeing.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Originally, I thought maybe the changed control flows bring additional spills in <code>bad.wasm</code>. However, the global variable[1] will not be used in program (I don't find <code>global.get 1</code>), so I think they should have nearly the same generated code.<br>\n2. I try to change <code>-65537</code> to another negtive numbers, such as <code>-1</code>, <code>-2</code>, and the execution times are the same as the <strong>bad</strong> one. However, once I change it to some positive numbers, such as <code>65536</code>, <code>100</code>, and the executiom times are good. So I also try to change another number in the program to some negtive number, and the execution time is bad.<br>\n3. I run these two cases in <code>wasmer</code> which also uses <code>Cranelift</code> as their compiler (but they use old version), but the executime times of <code>wasmer</code> before and after the changes are the same.<br>\n- <code>bad.wasm</code>(<code>wasmer</code>): 2.70s<br>\n- after change(<code>wasmer</code>): 2.69s</p>\n<p>Therefore, I still think there is something wrong during the compilation of <code>bad.wasm</code>. But still, I don't know how to do further investigation.<br>\nThe attached files are the new <code>good.wasm</code> and the <code>report.html</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15838381/new.zip\">new.zip</a></p>\n</blockquote>",

Alex's PR fixed the rule match (left-hand side) to catch that case as well.</p>\n</blockquote>",
