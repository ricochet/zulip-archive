This is simple in the Rust API which implements Clone, however it is not exposed to the C API.</p>\n<p>Use case: in tree-sitter's wasm support, we create a store object and want to instantiate modules into it over the course of the object's lifetime. This requires a handle to the underlying engine, which means our store must be kept alongside a reference to the engine (since tree-sitter is a library, it doesn't want to assume a global wasm engine). This currently requires transferring ownership of the engine to the tree sitter store container, which means we can't reuse engine objects between multiple stores.</p>\n<p>This pertains to <a href=\"https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/3454\">https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/3454</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
