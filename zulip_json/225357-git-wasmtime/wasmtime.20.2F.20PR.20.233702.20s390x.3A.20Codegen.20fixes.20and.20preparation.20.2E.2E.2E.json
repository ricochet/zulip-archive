These should not have any<br>\nfunctional effect, but will make the ISLE migration easier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Encode floating-point constants as u32/u64 in MInst patterns.</li>\n<li>Encode shift amounts as u8 and Reg in ShiftOp pattern.</li>\n<li>Use MemArg in LoadMultiple64 and StoreMultiple64 patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CC @cfallin </p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
