Those are still constant for the machine backend though (<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/inst/regs.rs\">here</a>); this issue is about slightly tweaking the division between those two classes. It would need a bit of plumbing to make this ABI-dependent, I think.</p>\n</blockquote>",
