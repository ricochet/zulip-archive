(I've been hacking in the pooling allocator and on performance-related things recently as well and your idea was a huge epiphany for me.) I need to clean it up a bit still but will put it up soon (with due credit to you for memfd/madvise/CoW ideas!). Perhaps we can get the best ideas out of both of these PRs :-)</p>\n<p>One additional realization I had was that, for performance, we don't want to do any <code>mprotect()</code> at all on heap growth (it holds the whole-process mmap lock in write mode, so can quickly become a bottleneck). But we can play tricks with ftruncate and a <em>second</em> anonymous memfd, mapped above the initial image, so that in a steady state with instance-slot reuse on reinstantiation, our only syscalls are madvise and ftruncate. (Key bits: mmap can map beyond the actual size of a file; size of a file can be changed after mapping is made, and this doesn't touch any whole-process locks; accesses beyond end of file cause SIGBUS.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, a few thoughts on this PR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The first-class notion of snapshotting, saving globals, etc., is interesting, and I can see how it could be useful in certain scenarios. However I think it actually mixes a few ideas which we probably want to separate and design independently: the notion of instance state, snapshotting, rewinding, etc., and the implementation-level mechanism of CoW-mapping a heap image.</p>\n<p>In particular, at least in scenarios I'm more familiar with, we do snapshotting via a separate tool that writes out a Wasm module post-snapshot, <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wizer\">Wizer</a>. IMHO, including a runtime snapshot-and-reuse-of-state-in-memory mechanism muddies the waters a bit -- which should be used when? -- and whether or not Wasmtime should have such an API deserves further discussion, I think.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Given that, I think something that we could more easily land would be a completely API-transparent extension of the pooling allocator. Basically a new mode that (i) creates a backing image for a module's memories when it's first seen, (ii) CoW-maps these images into memory slots, with the ftruncate-to-extend trick above, and (iii) tries to reuse slots with existing mappings of the desired images when possible. This is basically what I've put together, so I'll try to get it up ASAP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I'm a bit concerned with the need to read <code>/proc/self/pagemap</code> to determine whether pages are present. This has some interesting permissions implications (see <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/pagemap.txt\">Documentation/vm/pagemap.txt</a> in the Linux kernel) -- some bits need root or a process capability to see, and it seems that under some kernel versions the whole file is inaccessible except by root. In any case, this creates a deep coupling with a Linux-specific interface for snapshotting; ideally, such API functionality should be designed, if it exists, so it is not forever limited to be a Linux-specific feature. (In other words: performance-only features can be OS-specific, because that's the nature of optimizing for a platform; but functionality should not be OS-specific.)</p>\n<p>I think though that my concern here is basically subsumed by the higher-level question of where snapshotting should occur: if it is the domain of a separate tool, then that separate tool can do special things that may not be as efficient (e.g., diff a whole memory, or mmap inaccessible and mprotect() in pages one at a time), since snapshotting is probably rare compared to instantiation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think these are some things we should talk through after I've put up my PR and we can do comparisons. I'm really grateful for the ton of effort you put into this and look forward to comparing the approaches in more detail!<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

Let me explain.</p>\n<p>Basically we have three main requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be as fast as possible. (At least as fast as what we currently use, which is the <code>legacy_instance_reuse</code> you see on the graphs.)</li>\n<li>Be robust. (The instantiation can <em>not</em> fail.)</li>\n<li>Be simple to use and maintainable. (Although we can live with this not being the case if absolutely necessary.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the problems with the current pooling allocator (ignoring how it performs) is that it fails at (2) and somewhat at (3), and isn't a simple \"go faster\" option that you can just blindly toggle. You have to manually specify module and instance limits (and if the WASM blob changes too significantly you need to modify them), <em>and</em> you need to maintain a separate codepath (basically keep another separate <code>Engine</code>s and the same <code>Module</code> twice) for the case when instantiation fails.</p>\n<p>So personally I think it just makes more sense (especially for something so fundamental and low level as <code>wasmtime</code>) to just let the user explicitly do the pooling themselves, which is very easy to do with the approach in this PR - just preinstantiate as many instances as you want into a <code>Vec</code>, pop one on use, push them back when you're done, and if you run out of pooled instances you can just easily instantiate one from scratch with a single extra <code>if</code>.</p>\n<p>I also considered integrating this into <code>InstancePre</code> directly (or into a separate type) - that is, there would be no <code>reset</code>, and the instances would automatically reset themselves when dropped and returned into a pool inside of the <code>InstancePre</code> and then automatically and transparently reused when <code>InstancePre::instantiate</code> would be called (so <em>that</em> would actually be a transparent \"go faster\" option), but decided that it'd be better to just let the user control the pooling themselves since it's so simple to do <em>anyway</em>. (And also the way how everything is stored inside of the <code>Store</code> and not the <code>Instance</code> would make that somewhat awkward, since you want to reuse <em>both</em> the <code>Instance</code> and the <code>Store</code>.)</p>\n<p>Basically, in our usecase we don't really care about snapshotting at all (it's just an implementation detail to make things go fast), and all we just need is to be able to instantiate clean instances as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Would this be more acceptable to you if API-wise we'd make it less like it's snapshotting and more like an explicit way to pool instances?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think these are some things we should talk through after I've put up my PR and we can do comparisons.

There's probably some very minor wins still remaining, but that's the lion's share of improvements that we're going to get into wasmtime (that plus memfd).</p>\n<p>Could you try re-running your benchmark numbers with the old strategy y'all are currently using, your proposal in this PR, and then <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733</a> as a PR? Note that when using <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733</a> using the on-demand allocator, while maybe a little bit slower than the pooling allocator, should still be fine. The intention with <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733</a> is that it's fast enough that you won't need to maintain a pool of instances, and each \"reuse\" of an instance can perform the full re-instantiation process. Note that for re-instantiation it's recommended to start from an <code>InstancePre&lt;T&gt;</code> which is the fastest way today to instantiate something.</p>\n<p>My prediction is that the time-to-instantiate <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733</a> is likely quite close to the strategy outlined in this PR. It will probably look a little different one way or another, but that's what I'm curious to see if <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733</a> works for your use case in terms of robustness and performance. </p>\n<p>If you're up for it then it might be interesting to test the pooling allocator as well. I realize that the pooling allocator as-is isn't a great fit for your use case due to it being too constrained, but as a one-off measurement of numbers it might help give an idea of the performance tradeoff between the pooling allocator and the on-demand allocator. Also unless you're specifically interested in concurrent instantiation performance it's fine to only get single-threaded instantiation numbers. It's expected that <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3733</a> does not scale well with cores (like this PR) due to the IPIs necessary at the kernel level with all the calls to <code>madvise</code>. In that sense the more interesting comparison is probably single-threaded numbers (again unless you're specifically interested in the multi-threaded numbers as well)</p>\n</blockquote>",

The cost of the on-demand allocator is an extra mmap-or-two and it's not quite as efficient on reuse (a few <code>mmap</code> calls instead of one <code>madvise</code>). In that sense I wouldn't expect it to be an almost order of magnitude slower in the measurements, instead what I've been seeing locally is that it's off by some constant factor ish from the pooling allocator. Do you have some code I could read to double-check the on-demand allocator was configured correctly?</p>\n<p>Otherwise though I definitely think we can improve the story with the usability of the pooling allocator. The reason that the module limits and such exist are so that we can create appropriate space for the internal <code>*mut VMContext</code> allocation for each instance which is sized to each instance. I think, though, instead of specifically configuring each field and its limits it would be easier to say \"each instance gets N bytes of memory\" and then during instantiation if that's exceeded instantiation fails with a descriptive error message. That would mean that a generous amount, such as a megabyte or two, could be allocated for instances and you wouldn't have to worry about tweaking specific limits.</p>\n<p>Again though I'm surprised that the on-demand allocator is performing as bad as it did in your measurements, as my suspicion was that it would be sufficient for your use case. I think configuring the pooling allocator by allocation size is probably good to do no matter what, though.</p>\n</blockquote>",
