Instead now the initializer is stored separately from the type of the global, and only for defined globals. This removes the need in a few locations to synthesize dummy initializers.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I think <code>defined_global_index</code> should just be subtracting off <code>num_imported_globals</code>, right? Could you use <code>Iterator::zip</code> to join the initializers to their definitions?</p>\n<p>Feel free to leave this as is, but if you see an easy way to make this more obviously correct that'd be nice.</p>\n</blockquote>",
