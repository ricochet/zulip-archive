Unfortunately, while the<br>\nordinary else-op handler properly sets up the value stack for the<br>\nelse-branch with the parameters to the if/else, the unreachable-case<br>\nelse-op handler did not. This resulted in a bad translation and CLIF<br>\ntype error despite valid Wasm.</p>\n<p>Found via fuzzing by :decoder in<br>\n<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657895\">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657895</a>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
