Additionally some libcalls are now entirely safe code as their one unsafe operation was the <code>VMContext</code> to <code>Instance</code> translation.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
