We're hoping to have some continuous performance measurement infrastructure working soon (<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/issues/3\">bytecodealliance/rfcs#3</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/issues/4\">bytecodealliance/rfcs#4</a>) so we should prefer that for tracking over this general issue, I think.</p>\n</blockquote>",
