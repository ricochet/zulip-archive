I noticed that the loop started with <code>vcvtss2sd</code> which is along the same lines as previous false dependencies found earlier in PRs such as #7098. I had forgotten these instructions at the time and meant to go back and touch them up and #7731 has provided sufficient motivation to do so!</p>\n<p>Locally this takes that test case from 1.6s to 0.4s for me.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I knew there were a set of instructions in the back of my mind which we still did the \"fake the output register as the input\" for AVX (e.g. the instructions modified here) and when I ran <code>perf</code> over the program the first very hot instruction in a loop was <code>vcvtss2sd</code> which I remembered was one of those. To test out I split the dependencies and then the performance improved so I assumed it was the cause.</p>\n</blockquote>",
