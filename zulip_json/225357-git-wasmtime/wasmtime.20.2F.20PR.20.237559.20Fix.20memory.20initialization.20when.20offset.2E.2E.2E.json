This commit replaces an <code>i32</code>-to-<code>u64</code> cast with an <code>i32</code>-to-<code>u32</code> cast followed by a <code>u32</code>-to-<code>u64</code> cast which performs the zero extend.</p>\n<p>Closes #7558</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
