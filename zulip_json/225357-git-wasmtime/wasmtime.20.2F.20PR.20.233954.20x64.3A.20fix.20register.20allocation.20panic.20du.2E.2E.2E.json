I don't personally know the effect of calling <code>put_in_xmm</code> twice and whether it has some sort of cache to repeatedly return the same thing.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Calling it multiple times will return the same vreg.</p>\n<p>On balance, making <code>put_in_reg</code> implicit makes lowering patterns easier to write, I think; the real issue here is the odd condition that we can't use memory operands in compares. This is (as @abrown notes in sibling issue) something we should fix, for sure.</p>\n</blockquote>",
