The motivation for<br>\ndoing this is not very strong at this time, but the points in favor of<br>\nthis are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One less tool needed to cross-compile Wasmtime. A linker is still<br>\n  needed but perhaps one day that will improve as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A \"modern\" assembler, built-in to LLVM, is used instead of whatever<br>\n  appears on the system.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first point hasn't really cropped up that much and typically getting<br>\nan assembler is just as hard as getting a linker nowadays. The second<br>\npoint though has us using <code>hint #xx</code> in aarch64 assembly instead of the<br>\nactual instructions for assembler compatibility, and I believe that's no<br>\nlonger necessary because the LLVM assembler supports the modern<br>\ninstruction names.</p>\n<p>The translation of the x86/x86_64 assembly has been done to Intel<br>\nsyntax as well as opposed to the old AT&amp;T syntax since that's Rust's<br>\ndefault. Additionally s390x still remains in an external assembler file<br>\nbecause <code>global_asm!</code> is still unstable in Rust on that platform.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

My thinking was that I had all the context of fibers booted into my head and the CFI directives and such in particular are really tricky so it was easy for me to bang out some other \"maybe one day we'll support these\" architectures here. These aren't actually tested on CI at all and there's no actual way to use them unless you use the <code>wasmtime-fiber</code> crate directly (and why would you).</p>\n<p>Personally I'd err on the side of leaving them here in the sense that I've tested them to make sure they work (even with this PR) and otherwise it's one less thing to add if anyone ever wants to add support for arm/x86. If anyone else spends even a crumb of thought on updating these files though they should definitely be deleted immediately as they're not worth that much.</p>\n</blockquote>",
