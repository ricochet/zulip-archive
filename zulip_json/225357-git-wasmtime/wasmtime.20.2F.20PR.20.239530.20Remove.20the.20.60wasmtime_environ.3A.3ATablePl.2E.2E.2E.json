These introduce an abstraction layer between table/memory implementations and <code>Tunables</code> and personally I find it simpler to directly reference <code>Tunables</code> and use that instead. The goal of this commit is to plumb <code>Tunables</code> closer to where it's directly read by removing the \"indirection\" through the <code>*Plan</code> types.</p>\n<p>The <code>TablePlan</code> and <code>MemoryPlan</code> types are pervasively used throughout Wasmtime so instead of having one large commit delete everything this is instead a piecemeal approach to incrementally get towards the goal of removal. Here just <code>TablePlan</code> is removed and <code>Tunables</code> is plumbed in a few more places. I plan to also in the future remove <code>TableStyle</code> and <code>MemoryStyle</code> in favor of directly reading <code>Tunables</code> but that's left for a future commit. For now <code>TableStyle</code> persists and its usage is a bit odd in isolation but I plan to follow this up with the removal of <code>TableStyle</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
