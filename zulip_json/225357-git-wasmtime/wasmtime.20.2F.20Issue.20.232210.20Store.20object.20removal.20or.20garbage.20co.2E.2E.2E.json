On the other hand it allows the embedder to have some control on when the collection should occur. The addition of a function to the API for essentially basic functionality that is required in long term may not be something that is wanted as it may never be a part of a standard API for Wasm (for example C-API).</p>\n</blockquote>",

As a result, programs that would require loading modules for temporary use or to conserve memory will \"leak memory\" as time goes on and eventually the program will run into issues with memory limitations. Removal of objects that are no longer referenced from anywhere would free the memory of those unused objects. The main goal is to be able to unload an entire module once the module's structures are no longer referenced or the references are removed through the host by the embedder or runtime - the removal of individual parts of a module is not necessary.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>&lt;!-- Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>\nalgorithms to use? --&gt;<br>\nOne approach is to use reference counting of all objects in a store.

The collection could be configured by or left to the embedder to invoke.</p>\n<p>If a module uses dynamic steps, such as memory allocation, during the instantiation of the module (for example when calling the start function right after instantiation step), then the a function that deallocates that memory should be called before unloading the module. This requires the ability to trigger a function when a module is unloaded. The function can be called automatically by the runtime or it can be called by the embedder just before unloading the module through the new functionality. The deallocation function seems like it should potentially be a part of Wasm specification if it is not already.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>&lt;!-- Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they<br>\nbetter or worse than your proposal? --&gt;<br>\nAn alternative to automatic GC and memory management schemes is to provide the embedder the ability to directly attempt to unload a given module or all parts of a module individually. The module's memories, tables and other structures would then be freed. This would require the embedder to ensure that no references to the module or its parts exist or the references should be handled by the runtime either by removing them or by handling them gracefully when used.<br>\nThe benefits of this approach is that the implementation of if may be simpler and more effective. However, the potential references that modules may have are of concern. Either the embedder is trusted or a mechanism to find and potentially remove existing references or raise an error when one is found should be implemented.</p>\n<p>It seems that WAVM has implemented a GC function that can be called by the embedder.
