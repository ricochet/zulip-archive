Previously the trampoline<br>\nsimply received <code>*mut ValRaw</code> and assumed that it was the appropriate<br>\nsize. By receiving a size as well we can thread through <code>&amp;mut [ValRaw]</code><br>\ninternally instead of <code>*mut ValRaw</code>.</p>\n<p>The original motivation for this is that I'm planning to leverage these<br>\ntrampolines for the component model for host-defined functions. Out of<br>\nan abundance of caution of making sure that everything lines up I wanted<br>\nto be able to write down asserts about the size received at runtime<br>\ncompared to the size expected. This overall led me to the desire to<br>\nthread this size parameter through on the assumption that it would not<br>\nimpact performance all that much.</p>\n<p>I ran two benchmarks locally from the <code>call.rs</code> benchmark and got:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>sync/no-hook/wasm-to-host - nop - unchecked</code> - no change</li>\n<li><code>sync/no-hook/wasm-to-host - nop-params-and-results - unchecked</code> - 5%<br>\n  slower</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is what I roughly expected in that if nothing actually reads the<br>\nnew parameter (e.g. no arguments) then threading through the parameter<br>\nis effectively otherwise free. Otherwise though accesses to the <code>ValRaw</code><br>\nstorage is now bounds-checked internally in Wasmtime instead of assuming<br>\nit's valid, leading to the 5% slowdown (~9.6ns to ~10.3ns). If this<br>\nbecomes a peformance bottleneck for a particular use case then we should<br>\nbe fine to remove the bounds checking here or otherwise only bounds<br>\ncheck in debug mode, otherwise I plan on leaving this as-is.</p>\n<p>Of particular note this also changes the C API for <code>*_unchecked</code><br>\nfunctions where the C callback now receives the size of the array as<br>\nwell.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
