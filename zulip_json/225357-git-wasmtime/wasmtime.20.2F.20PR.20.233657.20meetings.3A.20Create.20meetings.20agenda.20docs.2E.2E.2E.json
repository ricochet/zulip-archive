Everything seemed to work fine, except for a small bug. Probably\n  related to a lib using wasm SIMD intrinsics, investigating.\n- fitzgen: what's up with rustix not compiling on nightly?\n    - old compile bug in rustix that's been fixed there, not updated upstream\n    - fitzgen may follow up with patch bumping the version in wasmtime\n</code></pre></div><br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
