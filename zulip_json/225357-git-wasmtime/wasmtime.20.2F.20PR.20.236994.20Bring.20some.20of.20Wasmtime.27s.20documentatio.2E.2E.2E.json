Additionally Wasmtime has a number of sections of \"more coming soon!\" where \"soon\" hasn't happened in a few years. I've gone through some sections here and tried to modernize docs a bit, and the high-level changes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Documentation about writing wasm is removed.</li>\n<li>Wasm/WASI proposals are folded into tier documentation.</li>\n<li>The tier documentation now additionally documents unsupported features.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
