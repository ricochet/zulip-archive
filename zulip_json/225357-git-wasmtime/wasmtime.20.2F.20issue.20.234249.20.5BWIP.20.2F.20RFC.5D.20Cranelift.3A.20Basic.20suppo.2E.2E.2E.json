How much would the increase in compile time for this be?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I haven't measured yet but I will soon. There are some optimizations I want to do first (e.g., make the egraph-to-CLIF lowering work without rebuilding the whole function body, reusing existing <code>Inst</code>s where no node duplication occurs). The path that runs without egraph-based opts will always exist, so debug builds shouldn't be affected; and my hope is that by subsuming GVN, LICM, simple_preopt, and removing the need to run them multiple times, we might not be too much worse or maybe even close to parity when sticking to a \"very basic opts\" level. That said the goal here will also be to allow more configurability in that tradeoff: eventually, it would be great to have a larger body of rewrite rules, and some framework that lets us configure \"fuel\" for applying those rules to some configurable limit. (More on this in the RFC for sure, when it comes!)</p>\n</blockquote>",
