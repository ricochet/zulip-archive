The fix here was to ensure that the<br>\nencoded form is used.</p>\n<p>The impact of this issue is that a module could panic at runtime when<br>\naccessing a table element that was initialized with an element segment<br>\ncontaining a <code>ref.null func</code> entry. This only happens with imported<br>\ntables in a WebAssembly module where the table itself was defined on the<br>\nhost. If the table was defined in another wasm module or in the local<br>\nwasm module this bug would not occur. Additionally this bug requires<br>\nenabling the reference types proposal for WebAssembly (which is enabled<br>\nby default) due to the usage of encodings for null funcrefs in element<br>\nsegments.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
