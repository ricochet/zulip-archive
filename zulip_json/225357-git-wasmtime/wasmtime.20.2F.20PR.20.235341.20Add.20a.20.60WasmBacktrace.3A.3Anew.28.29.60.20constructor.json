The new constructor can be called with any <code>AsContext</code> values, primarily <code>&amp;Store</code> and <code>&amp;Caller</code>, during host functions to inspect the calling state.</p>\n<p>For now this does not respect the <code>Config::wasm_backtrace</code> option and instead unconditionally captures the backtrace. It's hoped that this can continue to adapt to needs of embedders by making it more configurable int he future if necessary.</p>\n<p>Closes #5339</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
