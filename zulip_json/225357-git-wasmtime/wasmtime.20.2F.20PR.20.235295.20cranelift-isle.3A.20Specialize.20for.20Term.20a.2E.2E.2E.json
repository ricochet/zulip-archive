There's no Rust value corresponding to the root value of such a term, because it actually represents a function declaration with one or more arguments.</p>\n<p>This commit takes that to its logical conclusion.</p>\n<p><code>sema::Rule</code> previously had an <code>lhs</code> field whose value must always be a <code>Pattern::Term</code> variant, and anyone using that structure had to deal with the possibility of finding the wrong variant there.</p>\n<p>Now the relevant fields from that variant are stored directly in <code>Rule</code> instead. Also, the (tiny!) portion of <code>translate_pattern</code> which applied when the pattern was the root term is now inlined in <code>collect_rules</code>.</p>\n<p>Because <code>translate_pattern</code> no longer has to special-case the root term, we can delete its <code>rule_term</code> and <code>is_root</code> arguments. That brings it down to a more manageable four arguments, which means many calls fit on one line now.</p>\n</blockquote>",
