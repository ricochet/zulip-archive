It doesn't appear that <code>iadd_cout</code> is the target of any rewrite in <code>cranelift-codegen</code> proper, and is not used by <code>cranelift-wasm</code>; if at least <code>cg_clif</code> can adapt to these operators instead (cc @bjorn3 ?) then I like the explicitness of these opcode names much better and we should remove <code>iadd_cout</code>.</p>\n<p>If others agree, I'm happy to do a full review here!</p>\n</blockquote>",

I did the emit tests now (and fixed a few bugs along the way) and I think this is now in a somewhat cleaned up stage and could be reviewed. <br>\nThe CI currently fails because of the s390x tests failing which is because QEMU incorrectly emulates the overflow flag (see <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/618\">https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/618</a>). This was fixed in QEMU 7.0.0 so the version in the CI would need to be updated but I don't know if I can do that.</p>\n</blockquote>",
