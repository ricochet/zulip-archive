The version requirement on a dependency declaration is only required on a <code>path</code> dependency if the crate is actually published to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>. This tells Cargo what the dependency will be when published to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>. For <code>dev-dependencies</code>, however, version requirements are not required because that's purely local metadata which isn't required when publishing to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> (and those dep edges are dropped when publishing to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> because they aren't necessary). </p>\n<p>This means that any crates.io-based testing of these crates will be broken, as @bjorn3 pointed out. Personally I don't think that's a use case we want to commit to supporting because it doesn't really make much sense when we sort out the testing story ourselves.</p>\n<p>I can add a comment but it feels a bit off to do so. This is somewhat just standard Cargo stuff. I removed the version requirements where it wasn't necessary but there's no harm in leaving it in. Leaving the versions there basically just makes for version bump diffs to be a bit noisier. Otherwise I fear that adding a comment about this is basically just commenting on the delta from before-to-after, which isn't really relevant if all you ever see is the \"after\" state where things don't have version dependencies.</p>\n</blockquote>",
