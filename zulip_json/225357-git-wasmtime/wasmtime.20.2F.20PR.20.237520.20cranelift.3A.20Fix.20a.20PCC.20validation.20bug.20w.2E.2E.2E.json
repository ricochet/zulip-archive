This PR changes the current behavior by special casing these two and adjusting the size of the load, correcting the checks for floating point loads. This doesn't fix the problem generally, as this pr only fixes the Vex case, but it's a step towards stabilization.</p>\n<p>Co-Authored-By: Nick Fitzgerald &lt;<a href=\"mailto:fitzgen@gmail.com\">fitzgen@gmail.com</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
