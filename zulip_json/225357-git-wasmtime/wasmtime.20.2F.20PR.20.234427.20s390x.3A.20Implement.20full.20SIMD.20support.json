Everything is matched fully via ISLE.</p>\n<p>In addition to adding support for many new instructions,<br>\nand the lower.isle code to match all SIMD IR patterns,<br>\nthis patch also adds ABI support for vector types.<br>\nIn particular, we now need to handle the fact that<br>\nvector registers 8 .. 15 are partially callee-saved,<br>\ni.e. the high parts of those registers (which correspond<br>\nto the old floating-poing registers) are callee-saved,<br>\nbut the low parts are not.  This is the exact same situation<br>\nthat we already have on AArch64, and so this patch uses the<br>\nsame solution (the is_included_in_clobbers callback).</p>\n<p>The bulk of the changes are platform-specific, but there are<br>\na few exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added ISLE extractors for the Immediate and Constant types,<br>\n  to enable matching the vconst and swizzle instructions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a missing accessor for call_conv to ABISig.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed endian conversion for vector types in <a href=\"http://data_value.rs\">data_value.rs</a><br>\n  to enable their use in runtests on the big-endian platforms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enabled (nearly) all SIMD runtests on s390x.  [ Two test cases<br>\n  remain disabled due to vector shift count semantics, see below. ]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enabled all Wasmtime SIMD tests on s390x.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are three minor issues, called out via FIXMEs below,<br>\nwhich should be addressed in the future, but should not be<br>\nblockers to getting this patch merged.
