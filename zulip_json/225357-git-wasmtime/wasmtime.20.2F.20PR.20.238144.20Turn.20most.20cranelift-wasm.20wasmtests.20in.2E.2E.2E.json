But they'd be even more useful if we track what CLIF we actually produce from Wasmtime.</p>\n<p>So I'm moving them to the new disas test framework and adding basic CLIF test expectations for them.</p>\n<p>I've excluded the .wat files which were produced by Emscripten or Rust, because they're very large and their compiled CLIF is not very interesting to look at.</p>\n<p>For review purposes, the first commit moves the files and the second commit adds the test expectations to them.</p>\n</blockquote>",
