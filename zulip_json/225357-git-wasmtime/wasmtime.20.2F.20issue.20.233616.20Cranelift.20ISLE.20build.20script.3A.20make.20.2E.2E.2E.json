If we take this even further than the feature here should be on-by-default for development but off-by-default for <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> publications in the limit.</p>\n<p>Overall I feel like we either need to find a slimmer crate so that it doesn't matter or we need to consider these concerns for Wasmtime as well. Personally I'd be fine just using <code>std::hash::SipHasher</code> since it's at least built-in to std and despite being deprecated it won't ever be removed.</p>\n</blockquote>",
