Yes, it is possible to enable alignment checking for almost all relevant instructions, but I am not aware of any platform that does that, and in fact unaligned accesses by default is pretty much an aspect of the ABI at this point.</p>\n<p>However, stricter function alignment is in fact recommended for performance reasons, i.e. to maximize fetch bandwidth.
