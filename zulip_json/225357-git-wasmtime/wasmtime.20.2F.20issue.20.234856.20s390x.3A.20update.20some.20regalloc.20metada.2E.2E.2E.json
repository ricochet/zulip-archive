This was intended to solve the problem of how to <em>initialize</em> a register pair for those instructions that use one as input (basically, divides).  My model has been that I need to allocate a register pair (uninitialized at this point), and then load up low and high parts of it.  That used to work with the old regpair method, but with the new method it now exposes those uninitialized registers to regalloc, which it doesn't like.</p>\n<p>But fortunately, with the new model we can instead just load up the two halves into independent vregs and just construct a regpair from those two vregs.  That fixes the \"udiv\" case.  For the \"sdiv\" case, the instruction actually does not read the high half of the input regpair, so it actually <em>should</em> be uninitialized.  But here we can simply change the <code>sdivmod</code> pattern to just only take a <code>Reg</code> instead of a <code>RegPair</code> as input, which is closer to the true semantics anyway.</p>\n<p>Overall, this change simplifies the logic around regpairs anyway, so I like it.  I've attached a patch to implement those changes.<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/files/9491074/regpair-patch.txt\">regpair-patch.txt</a></p>\n<p>In addition, I noticed that you've consistently swapped register numbers: the <em>high</em> half of the pair goes into <code>%r0</code>, and the low half goes into <code>%r1</code> (we're bigendian, after all ...).   Also the two inputs to <code>umul_wide</code> were swapped (I guess the operation is commutative, but it still was a surprise).   I've added those changes to the patch as well.</p>\n<p>Now, I'm running into a new error:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">FAIL</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">filetests</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">filetests</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">isa</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">s390x</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">vec</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">arithmetic</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">clif</span>: <span class=\"nc\">panicked</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">in</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">worker</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>#<span class=\"mi\">10</span>: <span class=\"nc\">Could</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">not</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">allocate</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">minimal</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">bundle</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">but</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">the</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">allocation</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">problem</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">should</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">be</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">possible</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">to</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">solve</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This looks like a regalloc problem (at first glance, it occurs when using multiple wide multiplications in a row, so maybe regalloc runs into conflicts since they're all forced into the same physical register pair?) ... could you have a look here?</p>\n</blockquote>",
