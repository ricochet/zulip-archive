If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;<br>\nI noticed the SIMD tests I added to the <code>misc_testsuite</code> under winch were not actually executing. I then realized the <code>wast.rs</code> file includes <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/c2717d180e1419e3eef5d315266b1b0cc764d6c9/tests/wast.rs#L147\">this check</a> to mark Wast tests that start with <code>simd</code> as unsupported by Winch. This changes the SIMD tests I've added under Winch to start with <code>_simd_</code> instead so those tests are recognized as supported and are executed as a result. I've also commented out a couple functions and tests in the <code>misc_testsuite/winch</code> directory which use SIMD instructions which Winch does not currently support.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, I could make a larger change to the <code>wast.rs</code> file so the check for whether a given test in Winch is supported will label any test in <code>misc_testsuite/winch</code> as supported. The reason I'm leaning to not doing that now is I plan to remove all of the <code>_simd_</code> tests from under <code>misc_testsuite/winch</code> and delete the <code>parts.starts_with(\"simd\")</code> check when Winch fully supports SIMD so Winch will run the SIMD tests in spec testsuite. Having the copies of the spec tests starting with <code>_simd_</code> will also conveniently make it easier to identify which tests to delete when full SIMD support is completed. But I am open to using that approach instead if it would be preferable.</p>\n</blockquote>",
