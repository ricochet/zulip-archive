The underlying error is <code>invalid socket address</code>:</p>\n<p>&lt;img width=\"521\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-21 at 17 21 56\" src=\"<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/assets/9134003/6473efef-4306-45c7-8ca4-e5101d14f071\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/assets/9134003/6473efef-4306-45c7-8ca4-e5101d14f071</a>\"&gt;</p>\n<p>/cc @alexcrichton @elliottt </p>\n</blockquote>",
