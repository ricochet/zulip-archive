This method was removed previously in a refactoring to add <code>*Pre</code> structures but refactoring preexisting code to use <code>*Pre</code> isn't always easy, so these extra generated bindings provide a smoother migration path for code from before.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
