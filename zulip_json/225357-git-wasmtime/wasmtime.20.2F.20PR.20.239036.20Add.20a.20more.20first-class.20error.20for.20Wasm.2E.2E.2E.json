While there is a <code>compile_error!</code> with somewhat similar information it is not too helpful because the compiler keeps compiling things after the <code>compile_error!</code> is reached meaning that the absence of a <code>sys</code> module cascades to many other compile errors as well. This presents a more readable error with links to github issues in a way that halts the build and should prevent unsupported crates from being built.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
