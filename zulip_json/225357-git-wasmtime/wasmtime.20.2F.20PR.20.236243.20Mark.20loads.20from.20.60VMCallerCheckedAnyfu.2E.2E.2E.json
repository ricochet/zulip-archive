Once a <code>VMCallerCheckedAnyfunc</code> is initialized it's never modified so it should be valid to mark these as readonly and if called in a loop should be hoistable outside of the loop.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Nice!</p>\n<p>It'd be neat if there were some filetests demonstrating that this actually enables optimizations in some case.</p>\n<p>I suspect there is no way to hoist the loads for indirect calls out of loops even with this change. <code>funcref_ptr</code> is the result of a load from a table, which is not read-only (right?), and it's followed by a function call, which we can't prove didn't change the table entry. But it shouldn't hurt to mark these loads as read-only anyway. If nothing else, it should leave more room for scheduling the loads against other work.</p>\n<p>I think this should help with direct calls to imported functions, anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>",
