On AArch64 <code>iconst.i128</code> is not implemented. This PR implements it for values that fit in a u64, which is (I think) all the values that can be passed in by the frontend.</p>\n<p>We've had discussions in the past about removing <code>iconst.i128</code> (I can't find the link), and I think I've previously disagreed with this, but maybe we can restrict <code>iconst</code> to <code>i64</code> and add a helper method to the frontend that does the right thing? so, for example for -1 we can lower it to <code>iconst.i64 -1</code> + <code>sextend</code>, or <code>iconst</code> + <code>iconst</code> + <code>iconcat</code> for other values etc..</p>\n<p>What do you guys think about that?</p>\n<p>cc: @cfallin </p>\n</blockquote>",
