This primarily worked by extracting some rules to helpers and delegating to the helpers instead of specific instructions.</p>\n<p>One large-ish instruction updated here is the <code>unarrow</code> instruction which lowers to <code>packusdw</code> and doesn't seem to have any \"easy\" lowering so I took a look at LLVM and tried to simplify it for ISLE.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
