That being said I'm working to lowering x64's requirement to SSE2, the baseline for the architecture, at which point I was actually hoping on removing the <code>enable_simd</code> option altogether.</p>\n<p>In any case though wanted to throw this out there if you thought that adding <code>has_v</code> everywhere was going to be onerous. I suppose though x64 also asserts, for each emitted instruction, that the required instruction sets are all enabled so that would probably need to be added to the risc-v backend to double-check that the <code>has_v</code> guards, while not present, still didn't lead to accidentally emitting a vector instruction.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Feel free to disregard this comment in the context of this PR as it's of course fine to have what's here and there's no need to deal with this for this PR.</p>\n<p>First question though: how up-to-date is capstone in the Rust bindings? According to <a href=\"https://github.com/capstone-rust/capstone-rs/tree/master/capstone-sys/capstone/\">this</a> the latest commit there is to update to <a href=\"https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/commit/3b2984212fe\">https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/commit/3b2984212fe</a> which is almost a year-old at this point.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Ok nevermind answered my own question. I saw <code>include/riscv.h</code> in the Rust bindings but didn't see it on the <code>main</code> branch of the <code>capstone</code> repository. As the commit link above shows, though, there's a <code>next</code> branch which it looks like the Rust bindings are drawing from which does indeed have <code>include/riscv.h</code>. A quick scan of that header and I don't think there's V-related instructions, or at least I don't see a huge wad of <code>V</code>-prefixed instructions in that header, so it's likely that capstone itself doesn't have support for this yet.</p>\n</blockquote>",
