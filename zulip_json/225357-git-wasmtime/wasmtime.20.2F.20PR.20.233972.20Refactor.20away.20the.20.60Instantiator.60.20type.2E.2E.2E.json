With the removal of the<br>\nmodule linking proposal, however, this type isn't really necessary any<br>\nlonger. In working to implement the component model proposal I was<br>\nlooking already to refactor this and I figured it'd be good to land that<br>\nahead of time on <code>main</code> separate of other refactorings.</p>\n<p>This commit removes the <code>Instantiator</code> type in the <code>instance</code> module.<br>\nThe type was already private to Wasmtime so this shouldn't have any<br>\nimpact on consumers. This allows simplifying various code paths to avoid<br>\nanother abstraction. The meat of instantiation is moved to<br>\n<code>Instance::new_raw</code> which should be reusable for the component model as<br>\nwell.</p>\n<p>One bug is actually fixed in this commit as well where<br>\n<code>Linker::instantiate</code> and <code>InstancePre::instantiate</code> failed to check<br>\nthat async support was disabled on a store. This means that they could<br>\nhave led to a panic if used with an async store and a start function<br>\ncalled an async import (or an async resource limiter yielded). A few<br>\ntests were updated with this.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
