This removes the <code>set_raw</code> helper entirely from tables and instead forces all callers to view the table as either a table of funcrefs or a table of externefs. By forcing that choice outwards instead of handling it inwards it enables dealing with a typed table in more contexts which should help naturally do the right thing.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
