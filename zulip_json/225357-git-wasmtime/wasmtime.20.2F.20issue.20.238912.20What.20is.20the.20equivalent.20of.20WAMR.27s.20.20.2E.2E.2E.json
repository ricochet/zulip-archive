In the modules you're working with is a <code>malloc</code>-like symbol exposed to invoke to get a pointer into linear memory of where to write?</p>\n<p>One point to note, however, is that you'll want to be sure that the guest module is aware that it's receiving allocated memory from the host so it knows to deallocate it when it's done with it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
