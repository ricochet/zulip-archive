The unreachable vs unimplemented I um .. kind of have a different take. Right now, until cliff instructions are added, it is unreachable (I think?). There is no clif instruction (I think?) that can get here .. as this code is in a branch that has already checked for a vector type. Taken in context, the unreachable doesn't refer to just  fcvt_from_sint it refers to vector types of fcvt_from_sint in which case there is only one afaik? I will change it though because taken out of context it is reachable and in any case I think with this kind of ambiguity, for convenience power goes to the who reviews  :-) .. and of course precedence/consistency. <span aria-label=\"+1\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44d\" role=\"img\" title=\"+1\">:+1:</span> </p>\n</blockquote>",
