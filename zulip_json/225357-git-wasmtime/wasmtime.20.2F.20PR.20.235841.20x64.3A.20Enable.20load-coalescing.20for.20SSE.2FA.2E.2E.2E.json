This is beneficial for both function size when it happens in addition to being able to reduce register pressure. Previously this was not done because most SSE instructions require memory to be aligned. AVX instructions, however, do not have alignment requirements.</p>\n<p>The solution implemented here is one recommended by Chris which is to add a new <code>XmmMemAligned</code> newtype wrapper around <code>XmmMem</code>. All SSE instructions are now annotated as requiring an <code>XmmMemAligned</code> operand except for a new new instruction styles used specifically for instructions that don't require alignment (e.g.  <code>movdqu</code>, <code>*sd</code>, and <code>*ss</code> instructions). All existing instruction helpers continue to take <code>XmmMem</code>, however. This way if an AVX lowering is chosen it can be used as-is. If an SSE lowering is chosen, however, then an automatic conversion from <code>XmmMem</code> to <code>XmmMemAligned</code> kicks in. This automatic conversion only fails for unaligned addresses in which case a load instruction is emitted and the operand becomes a temporary register instead. A number of prior <code>Xmm</code> arguments have now been converted to <code>XmmMem</code> as well.</p>\n<p>One change from this commit is that loading an unaligned operand for an SSE instruction previously would use the \"correct type\" of load, e.g. <code>movups</code> for f32x4 or <code>movup</code> for f64x2, but now the loading happens in a context without type information so the <code>movdqu</code> instruction is generated. According to [this stack overflow question][question] it looks like modern processors won't penalize this \"wrong\" choice of type when the operand is then used for f32 or f64 oriented instructions.</p>\n<p>Finally this commit improves some reuse of logic in the <code>put_in_*_mem*</code> helper to share code with <code>sinkable_load</code> and avoid duplication. With this in place some various ISLE rules have been updated as well.</p>\n<p>In the tests it can be seen that AVX-instructions are now automatically load-coalesced and use memory operands in a few cases.</p>\n<p>[question]: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40854819/is-there-any-situation-where-using-movdqu-and-movupd-is-better-than-movups\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40854819/is-there-any-situation-where-using-movdqu-and-movupd-is-better-than-movups</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

It implicitly emits a load if the arg is actually in memory, which is why it can trivially guarantee alignment of any returned memory op (because it never returns a memory op). We should leave a comment about this I think.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The key is that the constructor actually emits a load and returns a register-kind value instead, so we (trivially) avoid unalignment by just never carrying through a memory operand.</p>\n</blockquote>",
