I added a <code>run</code> filetest that passes with the long sequence and fails with the AVX512 sequence: it looks like the machines running the CI have AVX512 and therefore fail. I started playing around with a new recipe that embeds the rounding control (e.g. <code>EvexContext::RoundingRegToRegFP { rc: EvexRoundingControl::RZ }</code> but this didn't immediately fix the test case (the emitted bytes aren't exactly right) so I will have to play around with this a bit more.</p>\n</blockquote>",
