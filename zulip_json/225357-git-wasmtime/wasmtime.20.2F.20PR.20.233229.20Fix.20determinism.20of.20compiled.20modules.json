This commit fixes that by switching to a sorted<br>\n<code>BTreeMap</code> for various maps. A test is also added to ensure determinism.</p>\n<p>If in the future the performance of <code>BTreeMap</code> is not as good as<br>\n<code>HashMap</code> for some of these cases we can implement a fancier<br>\n<code>serialize_with</code>-style solution where we sort keys during serialization,<br>\nbut only during serialization and otherwise use a <code>HashMap</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
