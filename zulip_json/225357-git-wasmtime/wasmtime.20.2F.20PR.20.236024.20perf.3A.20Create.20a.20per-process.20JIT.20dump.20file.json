Since the jit dump file name has to be unique and must follow the format expected by <code>perf inject</code>, the file name is a constant. This causes a bug that multiple <code>Engine</code>s creations will clobber the jit dump file. Because of the file name requirement, we can't simply add a counter suffix in the jit dump file name, because then <code>perf inject</code> wouldn't find the files anymore.</p>\n<p>Instead, we can use a single, per-process JIT dump file, that's shared across all the <code>wasmtime::Engine</code>; this works well in practice, and moves the mutex in <code>JitDumpAgent</code> in the outside world.</p>\n</blockquote>",
