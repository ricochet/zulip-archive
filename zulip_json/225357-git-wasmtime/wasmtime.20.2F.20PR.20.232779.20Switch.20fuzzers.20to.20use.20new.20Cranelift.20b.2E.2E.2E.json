The<br>\ndifferential old-vs-new-backend target still works by dynamically<br>\nselecting both backends (the build feature just changes the default,<br>\nwhich is what all the other fuzz targets use).</p>\n<p>We should watch for ~a week or so, I think, on oss-fuzz, to make sure<br>\nthis sticks without issue before moving further.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
