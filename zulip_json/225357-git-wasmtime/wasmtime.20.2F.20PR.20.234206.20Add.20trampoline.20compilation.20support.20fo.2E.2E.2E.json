Currently this<br>\nis purely just the compilation side of things, modifying the<br>\nwasmtime-cranelift crate and additionally filling out a new<br>\n<code>VMComponentOffsets</code> type (similar to <code>VMOffsets</code>). The actual creation<br>\nof a <code>VMComponentContext</code> is still not performed and will be a<br>\nsubsequent PR.</p>\n<p>Internally though some tests are actually possible with this where we at<br>\nleast assert that compilation of a component and creation of everything<br>\nin-memory doesn't panic or trip any assertions, so some tests are added<br>\nhere for that as well.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

We don't otherwise export <code>VM*</code> types to the outside world which <code>wasmtime::ValRaw</code> is, though. One way to solve this perhaps would be a <code>struct ValRaw(VMValRaw)</code> or similar, but I'm not sure if it's worth it per se.</p>\n</blockquote>",
