This fixes a few issues with the current<br>\nscript such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you rerun the script it won't try to republish crates already<br>\n  published.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once a crate is published it won't print an error trying to re-add the<br>\n<code>wasmtime-publish</code> owner group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This will automatically retry publishing crates if they fail to get<br>\n  published, hopefully handling issues like rate limiting and/or waiting<br>\n  for the index to update.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The eventual goal is to run this script on a tag automatically on CI so<br>\nwe don't have to do it manually, and these changes should make the<br>\nscript more robust to run on CI and also makes it so we can inspect<br>\nfailure outputs and rerun it locally.</p>\n<p>For now these changes aren't heavily tested since it's somewhat<br>\ndifficult to do so, so for now I figure we'll need to babysit the next<br>\nrelease or two with this script.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so. The list of<br>\n  suggested reviewers on the right can help you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please ensure all communication adheres to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">code of\nconduct</a>.<br>\n--&gt;<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
