This also insulates us somewhat from occasional bugs that slip into nightlies. (We had a similar strategy for the new-x64-backend tests for a bit, pinning to a particular nightly version.)</p>\n<p>In particular, for the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2823/checks?check_run_id=2332455218\">latest failures</a>, it looks like a nightly bug: the compiler is interpreting <code>_</code>-args as patterns rather than ignored args and then issuing warnings-as-errors to use underscores instead (!). The only immediate fix is to use a different nightly, I think.</p>\n<p>I can see the argument for the other approach, though, that we want to guarantee as best we can that we work with the <em>latest</em> nightly and fix issues immediately as they arise (this is analogous to the usual rolling release vs fixed release debate I guess). Happy to discuss!</p>\n<p>(I chose a one-day-old nightly for this PR -- let's s see if this works on CI...)</p>\n</blockquote>",
