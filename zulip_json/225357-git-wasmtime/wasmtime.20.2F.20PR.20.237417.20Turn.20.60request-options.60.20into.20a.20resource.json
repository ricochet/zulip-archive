Since we default all these timeouts to <code>None</code> anyway, I think a conversion failure would mean that the guest somehow managed to set a larger than u32 value to begin with, then tried to get one back. The host setting an invalid default would be the other possibility, but we don't do this anywhere in wasmtime currently.</p>\n</blockquote>",
