Previously this was created manually via two variants of a <code>Pollable</code> enum but this was somewhat error prone for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The more common representation, <code>TableEntry</code>, had boilerplate associated with it that had dynamic downcasts and such. This is now all hidden behind a more typed API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Callers had to remember to use <code>push_child_resource</code> which is easy to forget.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The previous signature of the readiness check returned a <code>Result&lt;()&gt;</code> which made it accidentally easy for errors to be propagated into traps rather than being returned as a \"last operation failed\" error.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This commit replaces the previous API with a single <code>subscribe</code> function which takes a <code>Resource&lt;T&gt;</code> and returns a <code>Resource&lt;Pollable&gt;</code>. The <code>T</code> type must implement a new trait, <code>Subscribe</code>, which indicates the asynchronous readiness check. This readiness check additionally returns <code>()</code> so it's no longer possible to accidentally return errors (or trap).</p>\n<p>This namely required refactoring the <code>HostOutputStream</code> trait and implementations. The trait itself now has a <code>check_write</code> method corresponding to to the same WASI function. The old <code>write_ready</code> function is now a convenience helper combo between <code>ready</code> and <code>check_write</code>. Concrete implementations are refactored to store errors discovered during <code>ready</code> to get communicated through <code>check-write</code> later on.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
