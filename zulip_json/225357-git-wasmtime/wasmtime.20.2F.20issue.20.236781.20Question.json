I believe there are also some npm libraries which wrap a wasm module to avoid having to recompile their C/C++ or Rust code for every architecture and OS.</p>\n<p>As for why Webassembly instead of the JVM or .NET. The JVM is not suitable as compilation target for non-Java like languages and requires a GC. And .NET is much more tied to microsoft and only runs on a couple of architectures. Neither is suitable for sandboxing due to their complexity. They both tried and eventually gave up. Webassembly is sandboxed by default.</p>\n</blockquote>",
