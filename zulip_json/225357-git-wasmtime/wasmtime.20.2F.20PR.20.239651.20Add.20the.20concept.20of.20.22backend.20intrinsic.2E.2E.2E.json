The basic problem is that Pulley needs the ability to call back into Wasmtime to implement tasks such as <code>memory.grow</code>, imported functions, etc. For native platforms this is a simple <code>call_indirect</code> operation in Cranelift but the story for Pulley must be different because it's effectively switching from interpreted code to native code.</p>\n<p>The solution I've ended up settling on looks pretty similar to native platforms but with a few important tweaks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new <code>call_indirect_host</code> opcode is added to Pulley.<ul>\n<li>Function signatures that can be called from Pulley bytecode are statically enumerated at build-time.</li>\n<li>This enables the implementation of <code>call_indirect_host</code> to take an immediate of which signature is being used and cast the function pointer to the right type.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A new \"backend intrinsic\" concept is added to Cranelift.<ul>\n<li>This is a new variant of <code>ExternalName</code>.</li>\n<li>The intention is that this has backend-specific meaning.</li>\n<li>For Pulley, this means that the Nth function signature is being called.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Code generation for Pulley in <code>wasmtime-cranelift</code> now has Pulley-specific handling of the wasm-to-host transition where all previous <code>call_indirect</code> instructions are replaced with a call to a \"backend intrinsic\" which gets lowered to a <code>call_indirect_host</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that most of this still isn't hooked up everywhere in Wasmtime. That means that the testing here is pretty light at this time. It'll require a fair bit more work to get everything fully integrated from Wasmtime in Pulley. This is expected to be one of the significant remaining chunks of work and should help unblock future testing (or make those diffs smaller ideally).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
