This PR starts this process (only for TCP) by doing a simple lift and shift of the code from the host bindings into the <code>TcpSocket</code> type. This should make next steps easier as the border between host bindings and implementation become much clearer with this change.</p>\n<p>In the future, we may choose to make <code>TcpSocket</code> a trait object allowing users to swap in their own implementations, but that's left for a future change.</p>\n<p>You may notice that some of <code>TcpSocket</code>'s methods return <code>io::Result</code> while most return <code>SocketResult</code>. It would be nice to move <code>TcpSocket</code> over completely to <code>io::Result</code> so that the implementation is completely free of any host bindings. However, there are some unclear/missing mappings between <code>io::Error</code> and <code>ErrorCode</code>. For example, when the socket is in an invalid state, we currently return <code>ErrorCode::InvalidState</code>. However, there is no <code>io::Error</code> or <code>Errno</code> that maps 1 to 1 to this <code>ErrorCode</code>. We'll need to figure out exactly how we want to do this mapping, but I'm leaving that for a future PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",

For example if all these methods were extracted into a trait I'm curious how that would differ from today where all the TCP interfaces are already behind traits, just wit-bindgen-generated ones. If the intention is to support an entirely custom TCP implementation without reusing much of the host one I'm wondering if it might be best to consider improving bindgen generation/options/etc instead? Before considering that too seriously though I'm curious to learn more about the trajectory of this.</p>\n</blockquote>",

You can see more of what I'm going for in #7705 (for example <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7705/files#diff-728be1d1452aac523d87cef757cf69bf7219f10781ceb14ebf55604312ab53b0\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>While I think there will be a large overlap with the bindgen generated trait, there's going to be enough difference that trying to make it fit directly will be difficult (and will only grow more difficult over time). I tried to keep this PR as simple as possible which meant a pretty 1 to 1 lift and shift which admittedly makes it a bit hard to see where the difference between the concrete implementation and the bindgen generated trait is. However, I can imagine that some state management will move back into the <code>host</code> module and the concrete implementation will change before we (potentially) move towards making this a trait.</p>\n<p>That all being said, I personally find the code as it is now easier to read since the actual networking code is separate from the boiler plate of resource management, and I'd argue even if no other abstraction were to take place, this would be a worthwhile refactor. </p>\n</blockquote>",

Adding a trait, for example, gets us back to where wasi-common was originally. That style of design has pros and cons: for example it's easier to slot in a custom thing but it's harder to understand as there's yet-another-layer of traits. The wasmtime-wasi crate is already pretty gnarly in terms of trying to understand it given its size so I'd be wary to insert more layers of indirection. (an example of this is that tracing through a wasip1 function call can be pretty daunting today)</p>\n<p>Personally I'm an advocate for pushing this complexity into bindgen whenever we can. For example if the complexity here is high enough to warrant a new layer of traits we could try to push the resource management into wit-bindgen instead. That's what we've done with trappable-errors for example (and <code>with</code>).</p>\n<p>Again though I'm happy to land this as-is if you'd prefer to defer the trait question into the future, but if it's a guarantee that the trait is coming then it might be worth trying to bottom this out before landing.</p>\n</blockquote>",
