But both remaining uses of <code>PredicateNode::Not</code> are in a macro, in branches which were only used by the now-deleted <code>predicate!(!is_pic)</code>. Since that macro is never expanded with input matching those cases, the compiler didn't see anything wrong.</p>\n<p>We should delete both <code>!$a:ident</code> cases from <code>macro_rules! predicate</code> now, but fortunately the only harm in leaving them there is confusion during maintenance later.</p>\n</blockquote>",
