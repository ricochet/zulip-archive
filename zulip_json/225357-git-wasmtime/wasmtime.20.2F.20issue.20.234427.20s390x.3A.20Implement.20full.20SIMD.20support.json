I'm now using a new s390x instruction to implement the \"pseudo\" min/max semantics, and this seems to be incorrectly implemented on QEMU.  This causes the pmin/pmax tests (both the cranelift runtests and the wasm spec tests) to fail under QEMU, even though the all pass on native hardware (both z14 and z15).</p>\n<p>I've now disabled those test to make the CI pass.   Once we've fixed QEMU they can be re-enabled again.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

For SIMD fuzzing the v8 fuzzer probably won't work since I suspect that the <code>v8</code> Rust crate doesn't have prebuilt binaries for s390x (or actually I'm not sure v8 even has support for s390x...) but the <code>differential_spec</code> fuzzer might work? If OCaml works on s390x then that should be enough to get the <code>differential_spec</code> fuzzer running and if you run that for a few hours it might be good to weed out possible issues with simd-related (or other perhaps) instructions.</p>\n</blockquote>",
