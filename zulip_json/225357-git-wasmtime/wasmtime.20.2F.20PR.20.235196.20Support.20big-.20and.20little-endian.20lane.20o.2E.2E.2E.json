These define the lane order to be used when casting between types of different lane counts.</p>\n<p>Update all users to pass an appropriate MemFlags argument.</p>\n<p>Implement lane swaps where necessary in the s390x back-end.</p>\n<p>This is the final part necessary to fix<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4566\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4566</a>.</p>\n<p>CC @cfallin </p>\n<p>This is still a RFC because of the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should we <em>enforce</em> that a byte order flag must be explicitly specified if the types differ in lane count?  (This would be easily doable in the verifier.)</li>\n<li>There was some discussion in the issue whether or not the <code>MemFlags</code> API is the right choice.  It seems that way to me, since it makes the semantics easy to specific, and is simple to implement based on the already existing <code>MemFlags</code> infrastructure.  If you prefer some other implementation, please let me know - I'd be happy to change this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
