To summarize a bit, the <code>--dir</code> syntax is inconsistent between Wasmtime and other runtimes, and a notable inconsistency of Wasmtime is the usage of <code>::</code> as a delimiter as opposed to a single character such as <code>:</code>. I'll also personally note that there's inconsistency with Docker which is another common tool for a similar operatin which uses <code>:</code>.</p>\n<p>As of <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7301\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7301</a> and Wasmtime 14/15 the CLI for Wasmtime will support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--dir foo</code> - opens the host directory <code>foo</code> and mounts it in the guest as <code>foo</code></li>\n<li><code>--dir foo::bar</code> - opens the host directory <code>foo</code> and mounts it in the guest as <code>bar</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I find the discussion <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/\">over on Docker's documentation</a> pretty illuminating here. The gist, as it applies to Wasmtime, appears to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Docker's <code>-v</code> is the \"old\" syntax and is acknowledged to be cryptic and error-prone, and this is basically the same as the <code>--dir</code> syntax Wasmtime has today (and the subject of <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7301#issuecomment-1771850498\">this comment</a>)</li>\n<li>Docker's <code>--mount</code> is the \"new\" syntax which uses <code>--mount key=val,key2=val,key3=val</code> which is more verbose but more clear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I wasn't personally present (@sunfishcode maybe you were?) when this option was originally added to Wasmtime my guess is that the choice of <code>::</code> delimiter for Wasmtime assists with Windows-style paths which have colons in them with absolute paths such as <code>C:\\foo\\bar</code>. Such a concern does not affect Docker, however, where Docker appears to support <code>docker run -v \\\\uncpath\\to\\directory:c:\\dest ...</code> according to its <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#read-only\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>With all that in mind, there's a few questions in my mind of what to do with Wasmtime:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Should <code>--dir</code> be kept at all? Should this be replaced entirely with a separate option with more obvious syntax to readers? (albeit more verbose to writers)</li>\n<li>If <code>--dir</code> is kept, can its delimiter be changed to <code>:</code> to be more consistent with Docker? If so how do Windows paths work?</li>\n<li>If a new option is added, what should it be called? Additionally what should its syntax be? For Docker it's a <code>,</code>-delimited list of <code>key=value</code> pairs, but I'm also not sure how this handles paths-with-commas in them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Personally I think that while the CLI was overhauled for Wasmtime 14 we can still perform this change when we want. It's probably not too too hard to have broad messaging of a change in syntax if <code>--dir</code> changes or gets replaced. So in that sense while we can't change anything for Wasmtime 14, I do still think changes should be considered for 15+</p>\n</blockquote>",

I know my personal preference in things like this sits all the way up one end of the spectrum, and what feels right to me is often perceived as unnecessarily cumbersome to my colleagues. If I try to put on my \"everyone else hat\" I do feel that having a simple <code>--dir host:guest</code> argument would make most people most happy most of the time. But having an extra totally separate argument with its own name for a more structured/powerful form also feels a bit yucky.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With only the <code>--mount</code> syntax, do y'all think we should use <code>--mount</code> as the option name or repurpose the <code>--dir</code> as-is today?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tomayto / tomahto. If all functionality was somehow squished into one arg (see below), I figure you could just keep <code>--dir</code> and/or have one as an alias for the other. <span aria-label=\"shrug\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f937\" role=\"img\" title=\"shrug\">:shrug:</span> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also with <code>--mount</code> syntax I actually don't think CSV is really all that bad of an idea.

(Ask three people what \"CSV\" means and you'll get four different answers.) And I've always been irked by tools that say \"the format of this is whatever libwhatever accepts, where libwhatever has its own quirks and changes unpredictably over time. I have no such qualms about JSON, especially for the \"other tools calling Wasmtime\" use case.</p>\n<p>Given that the _existing_ <code>--dir</code> syntax already doesn't let you specify _all_ imaginable paths (IINM, no escaping), I reckon it would be reasonable to have it support the shorthand <code>host:guest</code> form _and_ a more powerful structured form in the same argument.</p>\n<p>Does Wasmtime support some kind of config file or \"response file\" as an alternative to passing all options as command line arguments? (I don't recall seeing one.) If so, or if it might in future, what if command line arguments like <code>--dir</code> that have a simple form could also accept a JSON object equivalent to the relevant part of the config schema? E.g. these would be equivalent:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">dir</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">usr</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">tar</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">gz</span>:<span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">usr</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>#<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">inferred</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">to</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">be</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">an</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"archive\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">mount</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">type</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">dir</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"type\"</span>: <span class=\"s\">\"archive\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"host\"</span>: <span class=\"s\">\"usr.tar.gz\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"guest: \"</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">usr</span><span class=\"s\">\"}' # equivalent to what would come under a `\"</span><span class=\"n\">dirs</span><span class=\"s\">\"` or `\"</span><span class=\"n\">mounts</span><span class=\"s\">\"` key in the config file.</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The parsing rule for any such argument would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If it starts with <code>'{'</code>, or <code>'['</code> then it will be parsed as a JSON object/array matching the relevant config subschema, and if it doesn't parse then it is an error.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, we parse it as the shorthand, which may not be able to express all valid paths/options, but probably covers 90%+ of use cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then I imagine interactive users would mostly use the shorthand, people like me would use the JSON format always, and other tools calling Wasmtime would mostly write/pipe a config file instead of passing command line flags.</p>\n<p>Is that too weird? I guess it opens a huge can of worms around config/response files, too, so it might be too much to bite off just for the sake of improving the <code>--dir</code> argument!</p>\n</blockquote>",
