This is a historical accident from an earlier design where they were interleaved with each other. Now that they are not, and only the first increment has any RHS <code>Action</code>s, we should just split <code>Increment</code> into two types: one for LHSes and one for RHSes. The <code>linear::Optimization</code> would have a member of each type, instead of just a vec of increments.</p>\n</blockquote>",
