When I first wrote the <code>bindings_for</code> function it was in another module and I didn't want to make the <code>TupleIndex</code> internals public, so I wrote the <code>IntoIterator</code> implementation as a more limited thing, and found it was useful in several places. Then I moved <code>bindings_for</code> here and started using it everywhere but didn't notice that it became the only user of that iterator.</p>\n<p>This is one reason why we do code review, I guess!</p>\n</blockquote>",
