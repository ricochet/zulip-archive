In #8190 there was a subtle change in how Tokio and the CLI are managed, namely that a Tokio runtime is installed at the start of the CLI to avoid entering/exiting the runtime on each blocking call. This had a small performance improvement relative to entering/exiting on each blocking call. This meant, though, that calls previously blocked with <code>Runtime::block_on</code> and now block with <code>Handle::block_on</code>. The [documentation of <code>Handle::block_on</code>][doc] has a clause that says that for single-threaded runtimes I/O and timers won't work.</p>\n<p>To fix this issue I've switch the fallback runtime to a multi-threaded runtime to ensure that I/O and timers continue to work.</p>\n<p>[Zulip]: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/219900-wasi/topic/Wasi-http.20requests.20hang/near/429187256\">https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/219900-wasi/topic/Wasi-http.20requests.20hang/near/429187256</a><br>\n[doc]: <a href=\"https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/struct.Handle.html#method.block_on\">https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/struct.Handle.html#method.block_on</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
