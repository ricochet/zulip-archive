It must always match the host isa to prevent crashes. Even switching between the 32bit and 64bit version of an isa often isn't possible. (Linux has a way to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24113729/switch-from-32bit-mode-to-64-bit-long-mode-on-64bit-linux/32384358#32384358\">switch</a> between 64bit and 32bit x86 execution within a process, but I don't know of any other OS that supports this) If you want to switch between the old and the new x86_64 backend, then there is already the <code>experimental_x64</code> feature flag. The new x86_64 backend is not complete enough to be usable at the moment though.</p>\n</blockquote>",
