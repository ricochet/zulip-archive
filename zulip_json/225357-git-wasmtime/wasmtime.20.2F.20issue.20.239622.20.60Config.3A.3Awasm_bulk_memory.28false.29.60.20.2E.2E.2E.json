I've updated this in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9623\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9623</a> to remove this now-unnecessary validation.</p>\n<p>It's also perhaps worth noting that this is something where you may want to run <code>wasmparser::validate</code> ahead of time with a custom feature set if you're looking to turn off some features. That way you can be sure to disable reference-types even when the gc feature is disabled (as otherwise it'll always be enabled, it's just gc types that are disabled)</p>\n</blockquote>",
