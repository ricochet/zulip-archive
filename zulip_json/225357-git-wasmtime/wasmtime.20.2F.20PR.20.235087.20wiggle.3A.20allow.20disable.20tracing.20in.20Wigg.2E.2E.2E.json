This is handy for diagnosing issues at runtime, but when inspecting the output of Wiggle, it can make the generated code difficult for a human to decipher. This change makes tracing a default but optional feature, allowing users to avoid tracing code with commands like <code>cargo expand --no-default-features</code>. This should be no change for current crates depending on <code>wiggle</code>, <code>wiggle-macro</code>, and <code>wiggle-generate</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
