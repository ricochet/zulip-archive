Now that we have some sockets support, implement these<br>\nadditional functions, to make it easier for people porting existing code<br>\nto WASI.</p>\n<p>It's expected that this will all be subsumed by the wasi-sockets<br>\nproposal, but for now, this is a relatively small change which should<br>\nhopefully unblock people trying to use the current <code>accept</code> support.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
