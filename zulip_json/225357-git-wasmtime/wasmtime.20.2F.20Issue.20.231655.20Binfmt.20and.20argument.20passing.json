So even if we had a binfmt entry which added <code>--</code>, it wouldn't handle directory permissions unless we set up preconfigured directories to grant, but that's even less elegant, and goes against the spirit of WASI. We have plans to make the command-line easier to use which will address this, and then we'll be able to address the <code>--</code> issue at the same time.</p>\n</blockquote>",
