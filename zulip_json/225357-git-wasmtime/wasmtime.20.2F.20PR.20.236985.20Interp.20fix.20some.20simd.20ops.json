Since these are all bitwise operations, the fix was similar for all of them, convert the type to an equivalent sized integer type and proceed with the operation as normal.</p>\n<p>Additionally this PR also restricts the return types for <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-codegen/latest/cranelift_codegen/ir/trait.InstBuilder.html#method.vhigh_bits\"><code>vhigh_bits</code></a> down to scalar integers. It currently allows returning SIMD integer types which looks like an oversight since it clearly states that it returns a scalar integer in the docs. (Let me know if you'd like me to pull this into a separate PR)</p>\n<p>Finally, these instructions are also enabled in the fuzzgen fuzzer.</p>\n</blockquote>",
