Additionally with Pulley this isn't actually a native function pointer. This builds on #9630 to prepare for future integration with Pulley to ensure that the number of locations that have to deal with bytecode-vs-native-code are minimized.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
