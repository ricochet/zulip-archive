A few things that might be good to note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We recently introduced a new <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst\">instruction selection framework</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/regalloc.rs\">register allocator</a>. Both of those are used in the new <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/aarch64\">Aarch64 backend</a>, and we'll eventually move everything over to the new architecture. That means that any work on a new backend should definitely use this new architecture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, it'd be good to learn more about what your plans are around this, and what the implications for the cross-isa parts of the code base would be. I.e., do you intend for this work to land in this repository eventually, or do you expect to maintain it in an external downstream repository? If the former, do you plan to introduce robust continuous testing and releases as part of our existing CI pipeline?</p>\n<p>We recently had <a href=\"#narrow/stream/225524-cranelift-new-backend/topic/spir-v/near/199899542\">a conversation about similar topics in the context of SPIR-V</a> with @jasper-bekkers in our Zulip, which might be interesting to look at.
