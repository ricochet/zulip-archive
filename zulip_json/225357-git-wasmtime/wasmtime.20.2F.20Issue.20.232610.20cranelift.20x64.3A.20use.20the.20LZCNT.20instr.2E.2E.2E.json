Also done popcnt, same category of easy todos.</p>\n<p>For Clz/Ctz, in theory we could use Tzcount/Lzcount for i128 too: that requires local control flow (e.g. for Clz, lzcount on high component, if it's non zero it's the right result, otherwise the result is lzcount on the low component), so a new Vcode inst. Could be done in a subsequent PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",
