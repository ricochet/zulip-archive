That PR also added a wasi-test <code>path_open_preopen</code> that was intended to check whether wasi-libc's expectations were met. This test focused on the bug report we had wasi-libc around opening directories, and short of testing for the full expected set or rights. </p>\n<p>We got a bug report on zulip that tinygo, which uses wasi-libc, failed in the go call <code>os.Create</code>: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime/topic/Problem.20with.20WasiCtxBuilder.2Epush_preopened_dir.20for.20component\">https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime/topic/Problem.20with.20WasiCtxBuilder.2Epush_preopened_dir.20for.20component</a> . It appeared this was getting rejected in wasi-libc, using the rights reported from the wasi-preview1-component-adapter.</p>\n<p>To avoid chasing these individual wasi-libc behaviors much further, I decided to add the expectation of the set of rights to <code>path_open_preopen</code>, and fix <code>wasi-preview1-component-adapter</code> and <code>wasmtime-wasi::preview2::preview1</code> to always report those rights. This does mean duplicating that list of rights in a few more places in the source code, but theres no good way to do code sharing among these crates because the constants are coming from different crates/binding generators across these projects.</p>\n<p>I'd love for this to be the last time we have to kick the Rights can down the road. However, I'm now paranoid that, even with directories taken care of, we will run into the a similar problem with wasi-libc's expectation of file rights. I believe the behavior for file rights is consistent across all three implementations, so since we haven't gotten any file related bug reports since #6463 I am hopeful we have it right everywhere.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
