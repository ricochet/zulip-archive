The main trick is in what to record. In particular, one needs to understand the semantics of hostcalls and their memory side-effects. Consider the WASI <code>fd_read</code> call: it provides pointers in which the runtime is to place the data it reads; a recording for later replay would need to record that memory update as well, and replay it at the right time.</p>\n<p>(A lot of this thinking was done in the context of a \"multiprocess wasmtime\", which is something else a few of us have discussed: if the hostcall implementation lives in a separate process than the guest code, one has all of the same problems in capturing the precise memory reads/writes, in that case to marshal across the boundary.)</p>\n<p>There are at least three ways of doing this that I can think of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Require annotations on imports, and disallow direct access to an exported memory otherwise. The annotations would need to be in some sort of DSL: \"writes memory at ptr <code>arg0</code> up to length <code>arg1</code>\", with more complex variants for e.g. <code>iovec</code>s.</li>\n<li>Use some sort of virtual-memory tricks to capture a hostcall's updates to guest memory. (<code>mprotect</code> the whole memory read-only on a call out to another module or the host; any pagefault from a write allows the page to be written but then copies the whole page into the recording trace before return to guest.) Would work, but very slow.</li>\n<li>Use another mechanism for calls across modules / into the host that doesn't require raw access to shared memory from handwritten code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last option is the most compelling given the future use of the component model: the IDL (WIT) describes calls with pure value semantics (pass this buffer in, return that buffer) and this would allow us to accurately capture everything in the recording without any additional code in the hostcall implementation. For that reason, it probably makes sense to wait until e.g. WASI is imported via component-level APIs, and then build this recording feature for modules that don't export their memory otherwise.</p>\n<p>(Completely separate discussion: true parallelism and the resulting nondeterminism. Probably we'd have to disallow <code>wasi-threads</code> in modules being recorded, or else use something like token-passing on synchronization edges (like <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1508244.1508255\">this work</a>) for full determinism.)</p>\n</blockquote>",
