In that sense if the main concern here is gc of references and correctness we can focus on just solving that one problem rather than a more general problem of reconstructing the call stack. This is what both proposed solutions basically do (assuming in the first the push is elided if the frame has no stack map), but figured I'd point it out!</p>\n<p>One possible way to optimize your first thought would be to first assign a constant number to all stack maps (perhaps function-local too, so when compiling a function we know what number a stack map gets). The linked list entry would then contain a previous pointer, the function's global number, the stack pointer (which presumably doesn't change during function execution), and a slot for the local number within a function. Then when a safepoint happens we'd update the local number slot but that's it, ideally keeping traffic pretty low? (and this would also avoid baking in pointers and it'd be up to the stack walker to translate indices to actual stack maps). This could also presumably all be skipped for functions having no reference types.</p>\n<p>I would personally lean towards as little complexity as possible, though, so option 2 sounds pretty good to me as well. One extra possible cost though is that the base pointer of the shadow stack to push to would need to be recalculated after each function call in case the function call relocated it. That may be unconditional new memory traffic we can't get away from?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Though removing one dependency on the DWARF info <em>might</em> allow us to omit it if GC was the only reason it was generated (i.e., user does not care about debugging or trap callstacks), so could save some memory e.g. in production settings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[guard page] ... [reload shadow-stack top after return]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Combining these two thoughts led me to: wouldn't it be nice to just build this on the regular stack, where these problems are already solved ... which I think could actually be possible (let's call this \"Option 2.5\"): push refs on the real stack at any safepoint, in a contiguous block; push the block size; link this chunk into a list of chunks by reading <code>vmctx.ref_chain_head</code>, pushing that, and setting <code>vmctx.ref_chain_head</code> to this chunk.
