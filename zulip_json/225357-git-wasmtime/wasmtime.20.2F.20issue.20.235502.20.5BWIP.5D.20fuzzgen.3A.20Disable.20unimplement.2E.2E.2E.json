Please add the <code>riscv64</code> feature to the <code>cranelift-codegen</code> dependency in <code>fuzz/Cargo.toml</code> at the same time so the icache fuzz target can start testing this target too. That also means you can fuzz the codegen phase of this backend on whichever of your computers is fastest. <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span></p>\n</blockquote>",
