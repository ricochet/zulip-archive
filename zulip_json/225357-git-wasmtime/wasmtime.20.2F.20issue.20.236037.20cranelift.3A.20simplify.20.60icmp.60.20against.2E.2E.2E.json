I do actually like that, but just wanted to call it out and my interpretation of it in case anyone else has thoughts. It's not an idiom I've seen before in our rules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, the unused <code>umin @ ...</code> is for documentation. I can delete them if you prefer</p>\n</blockquote>",
