Non-equality should require a check that the ZF is set to 0. If that is the case then the parity bit cannot be set. From what I see the only case supported in cranelift that needs a separate check is the equality condition. The llvm code that I was looking at does have a case for unordered or non-equality that I think also requires a separate check. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alternatively, it seems that Spidermonkey will do an inline test for the parity flag and jump inline to set the destination result to the final value in this case.
