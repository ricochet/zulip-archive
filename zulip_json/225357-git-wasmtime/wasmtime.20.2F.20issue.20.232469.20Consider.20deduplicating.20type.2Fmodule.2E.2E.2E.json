This is a possible optimization we could apply, however, to save space when compiling modules. This is perhaps more important with module linking where it's more likely for function signatures to be duplicated across a family of modules.</p>\n<p>In any case wanted to file an issue for this and reference it in the code. I'm not certain this is a slam-dunk \"we should definitely do this\", but I suspect it wouldn't hurt beyond making things a little harder to comprehend as well.</p>\n</blockquote>",
