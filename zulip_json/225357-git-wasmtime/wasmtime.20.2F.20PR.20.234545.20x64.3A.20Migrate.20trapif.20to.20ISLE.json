This then breaks our producer-consumer coupling as well, necessitating the <code>emit_consumer</code> helper, which feels pretty unsafe to me.</p>\n<p>The most immediate issue is that if the <code>iadd_ifcout</code> isn't otherwise used, it won't actually be lowered, and then we're going to use bogus flags to do our trap. That seems like the biggest issue. I suspect this case simply isn't covered in our existing tests.</p>\n<p>More broadly, we want to remove <code>flags</code> types competely eventually, because they're pretty error-prone (see #3249). But until then, we should work on doing something safer (at least correct, ideally more elegant as well!).</p>\n<p>What about this: we write a constructor that takes the flags value (so in the pattern, capture it with <code>flags @ (iadd_ifcout _ _)</code>), and produces a <code>ProducesFlags.AlreadyExistingFlags</code> (that contains no actual inst), and handle that in <code>with_flags</code>. This ctor will need to call out to an external constructor to bump the refcount on the iadd_ifcout<code> as well (normally </code>put_in_regs<code> does this in an implicit converter from </code>Value<code> to </code>Reg<code>). Let's add a test where the </code>iadd_ifcout` is used <em>only</em> for its flags, and make sure it lowers properly.</p>\n<p>There's also a relevant comment near the lowering rules for <code>iadd_ifcout</code> that should be updated I think.</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>",
