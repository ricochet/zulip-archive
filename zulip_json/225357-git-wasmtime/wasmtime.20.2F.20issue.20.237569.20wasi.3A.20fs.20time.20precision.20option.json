Shouldn't the exact values be equal in Node? For example if Node reports a timestamp is N and it's updated to N+200us, then shouldn't the resulting timestamp afterwards be exactly N+200us?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because Node.js rounds to microseconds, if we set a timestamp N, the timestamp that actually gets set is a Node.js-rounded N.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The other axis is a fine-grained update of time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For now I've treated both of these axes the same - the fs time precision. Where the unit of time we update is twice the precision, and the unit of time we check for is equality under that same precision. This makes sense I think because we are effectively observing this implementation-defined rounding function.</p>\n<p>Ready for review, further feedback welcome.</p>\n</blockquote>",
