From what I've seen out there</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>info</code> is high-level logs that you'd want to show on every normal run of the program</li>\n<li><code>warn</code> is something went wrong but it's not fatal and should just be checked out when you have a chance</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>error</code> an error occured. It's not enough to crash the program but it's something that should be looked into ASAP<br>\n*<code>debug</code> any info that would be relevant to see the flow of the executing program</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>trace</code> very verbose logs. Generally not helpful for program wide debugging but useful when inspecting a small segment of the program. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
