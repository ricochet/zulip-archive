This<br>\nkeeps the stack creation mostly in <code>wasmtime_fiber</code>, but now the on-demand<br>\ninstance allocator can make use of it.</p>\n<p>The instance allocators no longer have to return a \"not supported\" error to<br>\nindicate that the store should allocate its own fiber stack.</p>\n<p>This includes a bunch of cleanup in the instance allocator to scope stacks to<br>\nthe new \"async\" feature in the runtime.</p>\n<p>Closes #2708.</p>\n</blockquote>",

For a crate like <code>wasmtime-runtime</code>, though, including functions which are never used is only a marginal  hit to compile time so I don't think it's necessarily required that we propagate the <code>async</code> feature everywhere.</p>\n</blockquote>",
