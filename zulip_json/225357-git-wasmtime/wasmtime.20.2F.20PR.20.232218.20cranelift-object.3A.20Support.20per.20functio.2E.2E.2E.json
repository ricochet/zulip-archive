One example is 26MB when a single <code>.text</code> section is used, but 15MB when a single section for each function is used, which is the same as when compiled using cg_llvm. I will probably disable this in debug mode though as it significantly increases the linking time.</p>\n<p>The same could be done for data objects. I will try how much it helps for them.</p>\n</blockquote>",
