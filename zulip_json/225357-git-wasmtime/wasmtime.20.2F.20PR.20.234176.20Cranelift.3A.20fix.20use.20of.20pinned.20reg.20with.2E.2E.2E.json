SpiderMonkey has its own<br>\ncalling convention in Cranelift (named after the integration layer,<br>\n\"Baldrdash\").</p>\n<p>However, the feature is more general, and should be usable with the<br>\ndefault system calling convention too, e.g. SysV or Windows Fastcall.</p>\n<p>This PR fixes the ABI code to properly treat the pinned register as a<br>\nglobally allocated register -- and hence an implicit input and output to<br>\nevery function, not saved/restored in the prologue/epilogue -- for SysV<br>\non x86-64 and aarch64, and Fastcall on x86-64.</p>\n<p>Fixes #4170.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
