Specifically if <code>fd_pwrite</code> is used the offset specified is ignored if the file is opened in append mode and the bytes are instead appended.</p>\n<p>This commit additionally refactors <code>fd_write</code> and <code>fd_pwrite</code> to have basically the same code with only a minor branch internally when the final write is being performed to help deduplicate more logic.</p>\n<p>Closes #8817</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

With wasi-common the behavior is subject to whatever the platform OS provides which makes Linux the odd-one-out. Papering over OS differences is easy enough in <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> but is not trivial in <code>wasi-common</code>.</p>\n<p>@pchickey how do you feel about sticking with these semantics and just ignoring the whole test in wasi-common? Alternatives could include not landing this in Wasmtime and taking it up in an issue with WASI and/or adding more stuff to wasi-common.</p>\n</blockquote>",
