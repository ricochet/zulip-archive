The module linking is no<br>\nlonger intended for core WebAssembly but is instead incorporated into<br>\nthe component model now at this point. This means that very large parts<br>\nof Wasmtime's implementation of module linking are no longer applicable<br>\nand would change greatly with an implementation of the component model.</p>\n<p>The main purpose of this is to remove Wasmtime's reliance on the support<br>\nfor module-linking in <code>wasmparser</code> and tooling crates. With this<br>\nreliance removed we can move over to the <code>component-model</code> branch of<br>\n<code>wasmparser</code> and use the updated support for the component model.<br>\nAdditionally given the trajectory of the component model proposal the<br>\nembedding API of Wasmtime will not look like what it looks like today<br>\nfor WebAssembly. For example the core wasm <code>Instance</code> will not change<br>\nand instead a <code>Component</code> is likely to be added instead.</p>\n<p>Some more rationale for this is in #3941, but the basic idea is that I<br>\nfeel that it's not going to be viable to develop support for the<br>\ncomponent model on a non-<code>main</code> branch of Wasmtime. Additionaly I don't<br>\nthink it's viable, for the same reasons as <code>wasm-tools</code>, to support the<br>\nold module linking proposal and the new component model at the same<br>\ntime.</p>\n<p>This commit takes a moment to not only delete the existing module<br>\nlinking implementation but some abstractions are also simplified. For<br>\nexample module serialization is a bit simpler that there's only one<br>\nmodule. Additionally instantiation is much simpler since the only<br>\ninitializer we have to deal with are imports and nothing else.</p>\n<p>Closes #3941</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
