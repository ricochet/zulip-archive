As such if the caller's incoming argument area is  not exactly the right size for the callee, some resizing will need to take place to ensure that the return address, frame pointer, clobbers, and stack slots don't get overwritten. The current solution on the main branch for the x64 backend is to explicitly resize the frame via <code>ShrinkArgumentArea</code> or <code>GrowArgumentArea</code> right before the <code>return_call</code> arguments are written to the stack, ensuring that there is sufficient space. While this does work, it does make a <code>return_call</code> more expensive when the resizing is necessary.</p>\n<p>To simplify this, we instead resize the incoming argument area in the function prologue to accommodate the largest possible argument area of any <code>return_call</code> instruction in the function. We then shrink back down when necessary before an individual <code>return_call</code>. This simplifies the implementation of tail calls on x86_64, as we no longer need to move the entire frame, just the return address before we jump to the tail-callee.</p>\n<p>Co-authored-by: Jamey Sharp &lt;<a href=\"mailto:jsharp@fastly.com\">jsharp@fastly.com</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
