I'm not entirely sure I like it -- it actually creates much more complexity passing through the backend choice everywhere, and it creates additional states to test (one backend included, but user has chosen another).</p>\n<p>My intuition here is that simplicity is better found by just reducing the number of backends -- e.g. if/when we decide that memfd supersedes uffd, we can remove that, and then we can do memfd by default on Linux, and all of memfd is already built to support some memories having images and others not, so it should support dynamic fallback to mmap much more gracefully.</p>\n<p>I'm also worried that since uffd was built as a static feature choice, I may have missed something somewhere that needs a dynamic branch -- this feels like a somewhat dangerous refactor.</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>",
