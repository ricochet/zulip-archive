This is because the ISLE and Rust implementation of constant generation have already diverged somewhat.  The new generated code seems preferable to me according to the Arm ISA documentation.</p>\n<h3>riscv64: constant generation cleanup</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Handle <code>f32const</code> and <code>f64const</code> instructions via ISLE.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>s390x: constant generation cleanup</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix rule priorities for <code>imm</code> term.</li>\n<li>Only handle 32-bit stack offsets; no longer use <code>load_constant64</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>x64: constant generation cleanup</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No longer call <code>Inst::gen_constant</code> from <code>lower.rs</code> or <code>abi.rs</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Refactor <code>LowerBackend::lower</code> to return <code>InstOutput</code></h3>\n<p>No longer write to the per-insn output registers; instead, return an <code>InstOutput</code> vector of temp registers holding the outputs.</p>\n<p>This will allow calling <code>LowerBackend::lower</code> multiple times for the same instruction, e.g. to rematerialize constants.</p>\n<p>When emitting the primary copy of the instruction during lowering, writing to the per-insn registers is now done in <code>lower_clif_block</code>.</p>\n<p>As a result, the ISLE <code>lower_common</code> routine is no longer needed.  In addition, the <code>InsnOutput</code> type and all code related to it can be removed as well.</p>\n<h3>Refactor <code>IsleContext</code> to hold a <code>LowerBackend</code> reference</h3>\n<p>Remove the <code>triple</code>, <code>flags</code>, and <code>isa_flags</code> fields that are copied from <code>LowerBackend</code> to each <code>IsleContext</code>, and instead just hold a reference to <code>LowerBackend</code> in <code>IsleContext</code>.</p>\n<p>This will allow calling <code>LowerBackend::lower</code> from within callbacks in <code>src/machinst/isle.rs</code>, e.g. to rematerialize constants.</p>\n<p>To avoid having to pass <code>LowerBackend</code> references through multiple functions, eliminate the <code>lower_insn_to_regs</code> subroutines in those targets that still have them, and just inline into the main <code>lower</code> routine.  This also eliminates <code>lower_inst.rs</code> on <code>aarch64</code> and <code>riscv64</code>.</p>\n<p>Replace all accesses to the removed <code>IsleContext</code> fields by going through the <code>LowerBackend</code> reference.</p>\n<h3>Remove <code>MachInst::gen_constant</code></h3>\n<p>After the various cleanups in earlier patches in this series, the only remaining user of <code>gen_constant</code> is <code>put_value_in_regs</code> in <code>Lower</code>.  This can now be removed, and instead constant rematerialization can be performed in the <code>put_in_regs</code> ISLE callback by simply directly calling <code>LowerBackend::lower</code> on the instruction defining the constant (using a different output register).</p>\n<p>Since <code>put_value_in_regs</code> no longer performs rematerialization anywhere, the check for egraph mode can be removed, which in turn makes the <code>Lower::flags</code> member obsolete.</p>\n<p>Care needs to be taken that other calls directly to the <code>Lower::put_value_in_regs</code> routine now handle the fact that no more rematerialization is performed.  All such calls in target code already historically handle constants themselves. The remaining call site in the ISLE <code>gen_call_common</code> helper can be redirected to the ISLE <code>put_in_regs</code> callback.</p>\n<p>The existing target implementations of <code>gen_constant</code> are then unused and can be removed.  (In some target there may still be further opportunities to remove duplication between ISLE and some local Rust code - this can be left to future patches.)</p>\n<p>CC @cfallin @jameysharp @elliottt @fitzgen </p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

(I see that in your commit message but it's slightly unclear if it's replaced by a check anywhere else that I might be missing.) The reason for this was that the egraph-based mid-end does its own rematerialization handling, and will replicate iconsts/fconsts into different blocks as appropriate, so we want to avoid this redundant behavior. (Ultimately once egraph-based optimization is on by default we can remove this remat code here entirely.)</p>\n</blockquote>",

Ideally, the lower_branch ISLE term would have a Unit result instead of InstOutput, but that would require a few further changes (like the side_effect constructor no longer works etc.), so I didn't want to do it as part of this patch.   I guess this could be done as a follow-up?</p>\n</blockquote>",
