Sorry for the mess here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, we've decided that checking whether the rule is actually an improvement is not desirable. In general, that should be the job of the cost function. Blindly adding equivalent expressions gives us more opportunities for other rules to fire, and we have global recursion and growth limits to keep the process from going too wild.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Good to see the new guidance for this, since it had been uncertain back when I first started doing these rules in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7693#discussion_r1430497487\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7693#discussion_r1430497487</a> </p>\n</blockquote>",
