For the purposes of building something service mesh-esque using wasm, more flexible SOCK_OPT functionality in the socket interface would be extremely beneficial. The big one we use in mesh world is <code>SO_ORIGINAL_DST</code>, but there are others. How would I go about passing ~arbitrary socket options to the underlying host?</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>Service mesh and other networking applications can have access to more complex socket functionality on the host.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>TBD<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
