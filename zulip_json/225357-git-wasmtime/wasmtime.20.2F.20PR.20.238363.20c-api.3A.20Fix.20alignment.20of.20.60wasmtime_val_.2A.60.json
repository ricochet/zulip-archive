In Rust <code>ValRaw</code> contains a <code>u128</code> which has an alignment of 16 but in C the representation had a smaller alignment meaning that the alignment of the two structures was different. This was seen to cause alignment faults when structure were passed from C++ to Rust, for example.</p>\n<p>This then additionally changes the representation of <code>wasmtime_val_union</code> in Rust to use a <code>u128</code> instead of <code>[u8; 16]</code> to ensure that the same 16-byte-aligned <code>wasmtime_v128</code> type in C can represent both payloads in <code>wasmtime_val_union</code> and <code>wasmtime_val_raw_t</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
