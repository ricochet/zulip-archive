They have all been removed from the WASI Preview 2 spec in progress because of these inconsistencies.</p>\n<p>We are not aware of any real-world programs or WASI users that are broken by removing this support.</p>\n<h3><code>fd_allocate</code></h3>\n<p>This operation from cloudabi is linux-specific, isn't even supported across all linux filesystems, and has no support on macos<br>\nor windows. Rather than ship spotty support, it has been removed from preview 2, and this PR removes support for it in preview 1 as well.</p>\n<p>The PR also removes flags from the test suite which work around this operation only being available on linux.</p>\n<h3><code>fd_sync</code> and <code>fd_datasync</code></h3>\n<p>The file sync operation is only supported on linux and mac, and there are different semantics on those platforms. WASI never specified the semantics of these operations, and our test suite never included use of these operations. We have removed them from preview 2, so this PR drops support in preview 1 as well.</p>\n<h3>TODO</h3>\n<p>I will also get rid of the fdflags sync flag support</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
