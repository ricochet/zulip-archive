There are still a couple of unimplemented SIMD code paths in the backend (e.g. <code>Vsplit</code>), but they are currently not exercised by any tests, so I am not sure how important they are (for example, they might be one of the IR operations that the backend is never supposed to see). In any case I think we are able to emit all instructions that are necessary, so implementing the missing bits shouldn't require more than simple changes to <code>lower_insn_to_regs()</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
