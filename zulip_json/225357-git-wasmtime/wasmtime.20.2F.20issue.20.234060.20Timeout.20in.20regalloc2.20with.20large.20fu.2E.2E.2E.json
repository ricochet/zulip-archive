For example our README currently says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fast. Wasmtime is built on the optimizing <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/README.md\">Cranelift</a> code generator to quickly generate high-quality machine code at runtime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and if we can't fix issues like this then I don't think that's correct to leave in the README (specifically the \"quickly generate\" part). For example issues like <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3523\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3523</a> come from real-world wasm modules that users are generating and we would basically need to close that as \"WONTFIX\" (since that's an old bug I just measured, the 0.36.0 release compiles the <code>extract.wasm.gz</code> module in one of my comments in 17 seconds and the <code>main</code> branch compiles it in 7 seconds)</p>\n<p>Separately from that for the fuzz input I don't feel like there's any great options here. If we artificially limit the size of wasms then we're going to fundamentally have a less interesting space of modules to explore. My gut is that we should implement simple heuristics one-at-a-time and basically play whack-a-mole until we stop getting timeouts on oss-fuzz. It doesn't seem to me that min-maxing trying to get the most interesting modules that cranelift can still compile in time is going to be too worthwhile, we will get more mileage from just getting fewer timeouts on oss-fuzz.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I just think this is a matter of setting valid/reasonable expectations. Optimizing compilers involve slower-than-linear algorithms, and register allocation is NP-hard under certain assumptions (splitting in particular blows up the possibility space, and register constraints make the solver's life harder too). If we can make Cranelift-with-optimizing-settings \"quickly generate code\" in all cases, then we have solved P=NP. I don't mean to be glib but I do feel that there is a widely varying algorithmic-complexity spectrum underlying superficially similar problems here that is sometimes not fully appreciated. This is \"years of research and PhD dissertation comes out of it\" level challenge if we want to do the heuristics well and ultimately slow/stop the trickle of outliers, not a simple bugfix.</p>\n<p>That challenge isn't uniquely ours, either: one can find \"slow compilation\" bugs for other compilers too. I spoke with Julian Seward recently as he was tackling a slowdown in IonMonkey (also regalloc-related). That's a backend with engineer-decades of tuning!</p>\n<p>So the main thing I'd argue against is: I am not sure if this is a \"turning point\" unless I've misunderstood the extent of our positioning/marketing: to my knowledge we have never said that we guarantee linear-time compilation, or anything of the sort. If we are super-linear, then there will be outliers.</p>\n<p>If others feel differently, that we must never have compilation time outliers, then this could be justification for building a baseline compiler. For what it's worth that is probably about a year of work to reach parity with current functionality and to optimize it well enough to rely on as a first tier.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's my perspective on this; sorry, I don't mean to be too rigid; I just need to say \"not possible\" when something seems not possible (at the requested level) to me :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm pointing out that if a user hits a slow compilation it's probably going to be surprising because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AFAIK most documentation about Wasmtime is that it's suitable in a JIT context. In my mind, though, a JIT context means that latency-to-code-running is extremely important. This, however, is not really of the utmost importance to Wasmtime at this time and fundamentally won't ever be optimized for unless we have a baseline compiler of sorts.</li>\n<li>Additionally if users report a slow compilation we're not really motivated to look into it at all. It's very easy to open up a profiler, see register allocation, and then forget about it. In a context where we do care about compilation speed and at least getting close to a JIT-like performance profile this seems worrisome to me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not proposing we go off and crate a baseline JIT. What I'm saying is that if we have reached the line in the sand where further \"big\" optimizations to register allocation are no longer going to happen then we need to reflect the current state of the world in how we communicate about Wasmtime (both in the README and in how we talk about it). Whenever we mention that Wasmtime can be used as a JIT we need to have like a footnote explaining that there will be outliers that take a very long time to compile. We also need to take fuzz bugs back to wasm-smith and make sure it doesn't generate such a slow-to-compile module any more. </p>\n<p>Basically we need to do something. I don't think it's reasonable to close a bug like this (and the other slow-to-compile bugs we have) and just ignore them.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The particular input is causing a lot of splits though and that's kind of fundamental to the design; a heuristic to band-aid this case might break others or cause worse performance on average. The agonizingly annoying reality of problems like this is that we can never win the game of whack-a-mole. In other words, I could go write regalloc3, get it completed and merged in 2023... and this timeout might go away, but then we'll have new ones.</p>\n<p>So I'm not really saying that \"big optimizations won't happen\" so much as: this kind of bug won't go away, there will always be outliers, and we should be prepared for that reality somehow.</p>\n<p>Re: how we advertise, all I can say I guess is that we're in good company -- most other compilers will have outliers too -- so we could add the asterisk, but then LLVM needs that, and SpiderMonkey (*for the optimizing tier), and Golang, and ...</p>\n<p>I talked with @tschneidereit a bit yesterday about this and setting expectations with optimizing compilers and outliers; Till, any more thoughts here?</p>\n</blockquote>",

For those, a baseline compiler is needed on a pretty fundamental level.</p>\n<p>In turn this means that there very clearly is room for a baseline tier or even an interpreter in wasmtime, and I expect that to materialize eventually. For use cases where these kinds of pathological cases aren't acceptable, but the default should still be optimized compilation, one could imagine setups like using Cranelift with a timeout, and falling back to baseline if the timeout is hit.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We can't bill ourselves as \"suitable for JIT in all cases\" given the compile-time outliers we're fundamentally going to have without a baseline compiler in my opinion. We need to make sure documentation and such indicates that the JIT part of Wasmtime is only suitable if outliers in compile times are acceptable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Re: how we advertise, all I can say I guess is that we're in good company -- most other compilers will have outliers too -- so we could add the asterisk, but then LLVM needs that, and SpiderMonkey (*for the optimizing tier), and Golang, and ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Personally this is what I want to push back against. Wasmtime is notably different than SpiderMonkey due to its lack of a basline compiler or interpreter, which means that in my mind that's an apples-to-oranges comparison.</p>\n<p>For other compilers I'm under the impression that no one expects LLVM to be fast and I suspect Go folks are similar where they don't expect 100% of code to compile quickly. Users on the web, however, do generally expect that 100% of code gets at least running quickly.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Overall I'm probably going to just ignore timeouts in fuzz bugs for now and we'll figure out a way to deal with them if that ever becomes a problem. Otherwise I don't think it's worthwhile keeping an issue open for this, so I'm going to close it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
