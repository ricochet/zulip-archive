This question on per lane vs no lane in the enum is a good one. I think we discussed it in a recent cranelift meeting and is something that can be changed in the future if we think that is best. I think we said the benefits for having one SseOpcode per lane (how it is now) were just (1) the explicitness that made the code easier to read, less to infer, less to chase down what a lowering was ultimately doing, and (2) the explicitness prevents the creation of lowering nonsensical instructions. So that was general thought, but you were out and obviously enumerating each instruction is maybe not desired and maybe removes some sort of flexibility and so ultimately this is something that is still an open and can be refactored if that's the better direction.</p>\n</blockquote>",
