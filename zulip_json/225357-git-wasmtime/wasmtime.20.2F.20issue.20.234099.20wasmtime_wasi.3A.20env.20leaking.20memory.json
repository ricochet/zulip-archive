I don't think that the problem is with <code>inherit_env</code>, rather simply any env var being defined. (this reproduces when defining just a single env var). Also note that this isn't a leak in Wasmtime, but rather then wasm module itself.</p>\n<p>The <code>do_something</code> export is wrapped automatically by LLD so that every time it's called it first calls <code>__wasm_call_ctors</code> followed by a call to <code>__wasm_call_dtors</code>. For this particular wasm module the ctors initializes the environment but the dtors don't actually free anything, so the environment is initialized every time the function is called, which results in the apparent leak.</p>\n<p>@sunfishcode is this perhaps updated in wasi-libc already? Does the Rust toolchain just need to update its wasi-libc version?</p>\n</blockquote>",

To build a module that can be called into multiple times, the toolchain now expects users to build in \"reactor\". The rust toolchain unfortunately does not yet have a flag for enabling \"reactor\" mode. We should consider adding one. Though adding one that can be relatively stable will require answering complex questions about \"what is a wasm cdylib?\" and \"what is a wasm reactor?\" which have been difficult to answer while module-linking has been in flux.</p>\n<p>It is a change from previous versions. It used to be the case that \"command\" executables were more forgiving about being called multiple times. Some things didn't work, and it wasn't ever documented or anticipated that calling into wasm modules multiple times would work, but it does appear to have turned out to work in practice for some users. When I made the change, quite a while ago at this point, I was trying to fix the things that didn't work, and I didn't realize how many people were depending on the old behavior continuing to work the way it did. These changes are now showing up in toolchains and unfortunately breaking these users' code.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
