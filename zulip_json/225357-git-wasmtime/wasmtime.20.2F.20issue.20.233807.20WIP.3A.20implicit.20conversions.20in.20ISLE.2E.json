Or said another way, once we have <code>t_to_u</code> and the system knows about it, there's no difference in behavior whether we use that to take a <code>T</code> and apply a pattern for a <code>U</code> on the extractor side, or evaluate an expression for a <code>T</code> and convert it to a final <code>U</code> result on the constructor side.

I'm quite excited by how clean the rules turn out to be -- for example, the basic lowering for integer add is literally</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Common Lisp\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\">;; Add two registers.</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">rule</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">lower</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">has_type</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">fits_in_64</span> <span class=\"nv\">ty</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n                       <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">iadd</span> <span class=\"nv\">x</span> <span class=\"nv\">y</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">add</span> <span class=\"nv\">ty</span> <span class=\"nv\">x</span> <span class=\"nv\">y</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>where the <code>(put_value_in_reg ...)</code> and <code>(value_reg ...)</code> are inserted implicitly. All of the conversions between Gpr/Xmm newtypes, the various argument forms (Reg, RegMem, RegMemImm, likewise for Xmm/Gpr), etc. all became automatic as well.</p>\n<p>This PR has just the changes to the DSL compiler, and documentation changes, as well as the new ISLE testing infrastructure. I'll do a followup PR with the branch linked above containing a refactor to actually define and use some converters.</p>\n</blockquote>",
