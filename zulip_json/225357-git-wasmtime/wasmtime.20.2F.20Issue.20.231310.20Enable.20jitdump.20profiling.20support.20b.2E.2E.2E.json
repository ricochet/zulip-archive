I passed <code>-g</code> and got at least some line number/etc in the output. They didn't seem like the most accurate things in the world, but then again I've found <code>perf</code>'s sources to rarely be that accurate anyway!</p>\n<p>In any case I'm curious on your thoughts on this!</p>\n</blockquote>",

Specifically for a production build jitdump support should not be baked in by default I don't think. Also, when vtune support is added should that also be default?  Should we just make this default for the debug build but optional for the production build?</p>\n</blockquote>",

The binaries we ship I think we're ok enabling them, and then users building their own binaries still have the option to turn this feature on/off. </p>\n<p>I'm fine going either way myself, I just found this to be so slick once it worked it seemed like we'd want it in official builds by default :)</p>\n</blockquote>",
