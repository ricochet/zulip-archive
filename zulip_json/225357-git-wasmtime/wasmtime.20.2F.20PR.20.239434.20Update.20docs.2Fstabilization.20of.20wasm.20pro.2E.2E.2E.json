The goal of this commit it to explicitly list all requirements for each WebAssembly proposal in a way such that enabling a feature requires actively checking this table and performing effort to fill in. This is intended to mitigate GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg where it was found that we were accidentally not fuzzing tail calls but had enabled it by default.</p>\n<p>This shuffles around some documentation, modernizes a bit, and notably tries to list out a green checkbox or red X for the status of various proposals. Notes for \"holes\" in the \"on by default matrix\" are also added.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed.
