I'm thinking about what the best way to install wasmtime in GitHub Actions and I don't like using <code>install.sh</code> as it assumes shell changes.

The easiest by far is <code>- run: cargo install wasmtime-cli</code> but that's slow. You can add caching to make it faster but that gets sort of unwieldy and annoying to manage. You could otherwise have a macos/unix/Windows-specific block to download each binary and install them and add them to PATH, but I also find that pretty unwieldy.</p>\n<p>Basically I've never found a great way to install precompiled binaries on github actions, but if there's an action like \"go download this release for the current platform from this repo\" and all we need to do is restructure the tarballs we should definitely do that. I'm not aware of one myself though.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I guess as long as you are always willing to move the tags to match the version then it should work, although updating all of those tags when there's been a fix would be a bit of a headache.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>having it as a <code>with:</code> argument also seems reasonable</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's probably the best, it just becomes a question of whether it's okay to require the full version (e.g., <code>9.0.0</code>) or if you could leave bits off and have them filled in (e.g. <code>9</code> gets you <code>9.0.4</code>), and is it worth the effort to make that work? Would most people want the latest <strong>or</strong> a specific version for some reason? Or would it be better to just have the action for the latest and provide the YAML snippet for those that need a specific version?</p>\n</blockquote>",
