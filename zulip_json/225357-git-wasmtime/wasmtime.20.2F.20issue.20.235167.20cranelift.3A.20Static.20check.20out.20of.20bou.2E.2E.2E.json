This is a separation-of-concerns issue in my mind: the allowed IR should be defined separately from how powerful we can make our analyses (or in other words, IR should not be disallowed because \"the compiler can't prove X\"). That is a recipe for very confusing issues where validation state flips back and forth as optimizations change code.</p>\n<p>For a very concrete example, removing redundant blockparams could allow an analysis to see further; it could then suddenly observe a statically-known-to-be-invalid combinatino of size and offset; and so we have an optimization pass that takes legal IR and produces illegal IR, according to our validator.</p>\n<p>In general, the legality of loads/stores is a <em>dynamic</em> property, not a static (type-like) property, and for consistency we should keep it that way, I think; anything else causes confusing and unintuitive behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>",

As long as we state that the results are not hard errors (i.e., are not part of the definition of \"correct IR\"), that seems fine to me.</p>\n</blockquote>",
