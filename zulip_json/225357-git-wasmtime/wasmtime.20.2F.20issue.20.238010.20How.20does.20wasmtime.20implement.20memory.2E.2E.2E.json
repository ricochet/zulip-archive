Unfortunately this probably won't be the answer your looking for. I can answer direct questions like what the proposal is and how it affects Wasmtime, but I'm not aware of any tutorials or longer-form documentation about how to get started with the proposal. For that you'll be on your own to put the pieces together and figure out if it works for you.</p>\n<p>As far as I know the usage of memory64 in Wasmtime and throughout the ecosystem is \"not great\" at this moment. For example there does not exist any memory64-based WASI target that's usable in standard runtimes, meaning you won't be able to do anything unless you define your own set of host APIs, which is generally a big task.</p>\n<p>In terms of the Wasmtime embedding API, not much changed with <code>memory64</code>. You still get a <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html\"><code>Memory</code></a> and work with that as usual. For wasm this means that WebAssembly can have a memory larger than 4G, and pointers are generally 64-bits instead of 32-bits.</p>\n</blockquote>",
