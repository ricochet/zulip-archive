This is used inconsistently, and causes a compiler error on the expanded code. See issue #9315 for more details.</p>\n<p>I have also added test to the wasmtime-component-macro crate to prevent this from regressing.</p>\n<p>This is my first contribution to this project so please let me know if you need any additional information or changes.</p>\n</blockquote>",
