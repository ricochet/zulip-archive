This also makes it easier to track places where we<br>\nwould have to support type exports in translation in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Otherwise my worry is that when you import and instance with a type export and then alias a type from that during the <code>translate.rs</code> phase we don't otherwise have a type scope to associate with that because we don't know how the import was satisfied.</p>\n</blockquote>",
