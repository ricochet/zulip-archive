They do not, however, adjust the caller's virtual SP, so that still needs to happen in our ABI and <code>CallSite</code> code. This is, however, slightly trickier than just emitting a nominal SP adjustment pseudo-instruction because we cannot let regalloc attempt to spill or reload values between the call and the SP adjustment because the stack offsets will be off by the size of the stack arguments to the call. Therefore, we add the number of bytes that the callee pops to the <code>CallInfo</code> structures and have emission update the virtual SP atomically with regards to the call itself.</p>\n<p>Fixes #6581<br>\nFixes #6582</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
