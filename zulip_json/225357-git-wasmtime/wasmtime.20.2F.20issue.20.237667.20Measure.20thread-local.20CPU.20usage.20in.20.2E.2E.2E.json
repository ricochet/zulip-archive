That's generally easier for people to understand.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>On POSIX platforms, the clock to use is <code>rustix::time::clock_gettime(ClockId::ThreadCPUTime)</code>. I don't know how to do this on Windows.</p>\n<p>In <code>GuestProfiler::sample</code>, the call to <code>self.profile.add_sample</code> currently passes <code>CpuDelta::ZERO</code> and should instead pass the difference between two queries of the above clock.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if this would work correctly for an embedder who time-slices between different guests on the same OS thread. I don't know if we can detect when the current guest is swapped out or back in without some kind of magic attached to the current wasmtime-fibers code for swapping thread-local storage.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>The profiler is usable without this CPU time metric.</p>\n</blockquote>",
