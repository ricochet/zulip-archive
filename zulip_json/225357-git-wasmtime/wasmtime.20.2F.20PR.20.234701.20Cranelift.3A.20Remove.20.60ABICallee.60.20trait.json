In some cases they are vague and still in development. Rust crate authors should consider them as a set of important considerations in the development of idiomatic and interoperable Rust libraries, to use as they see fit. These guidelines should not in any way be considered a mandate that crate authors must follow, though they may find that crates that conform well to these guidelines integrate better with the existing crate ecosystem than those that do not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I find <code>AbiCallee</code> looks wrong to me; an ABI is an ABI, not an Abi (or \"abi\"); I'd really prefer not to take the change. If it's confusing to me and not confusing to you, then there is likely a split among other readers as well. Given that it is currently this way and there is disagreement, could we keep with the current convention for this PR and then discuss separately?
