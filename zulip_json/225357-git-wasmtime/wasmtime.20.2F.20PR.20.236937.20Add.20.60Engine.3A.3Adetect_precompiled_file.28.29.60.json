I initially hoped to avoid <code>ModuleOrComponent</code> in the <code>wasmtime</code> crate's API but I think <code>from_trusted_file</code> would work there.</p>\n<p>Overall at least from the CLI I felt that our API for loading modules/components is still kinda clunky. I couldn't really figure out a better replacement though so I gave up and added <code>detect_precompiled</code>. I'm definitely all-ears though for other suggestions!</p>\n</blockquote>",
