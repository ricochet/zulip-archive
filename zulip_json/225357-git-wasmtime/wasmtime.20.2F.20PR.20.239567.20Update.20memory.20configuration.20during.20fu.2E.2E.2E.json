Previously this was either 0 or an arbitrary 32-bit number. This ended up not not handling cases such as 4GiB exactly which is 1 larger than the 32-bit range. Additionally 33+-bit numbers were never tested. This intends to expand our fuzz coverage here by most of the time using the default settings of <code>Config</code> and then otherwise selecting amongst an \"interesting\" set of numbers such as 0, powers of two, etc.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
