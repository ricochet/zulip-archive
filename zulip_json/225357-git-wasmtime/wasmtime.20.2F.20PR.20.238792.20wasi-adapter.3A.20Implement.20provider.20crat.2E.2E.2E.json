As per @alexcrichton's suggestion, this crate contains the adapter files as artefacts, which are checked in CI to match the freshly compiled versions of the <code>wasi-preview1-component-adapter</code> crate. The new crate is intended to be published on <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> and allow Rust code which programmatically builds WASM components to use the adapter without needing more than a normal crate dependency (instead of having to manually download the file).</p>\n</blockquote>",

I find this not super appealing though because it adds binary file churn to this repository which feels unfortunate.</li>\n<li>Add a <code>build.rs</code> to the provider crate which injects version information. To be maximally useful this would probably want to have zero build-dependencies which makes it a bit difficult to do, though.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall I'd probably still be most in favor of just dropping the version information in the binary.
