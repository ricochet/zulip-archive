The error seems to originate from <code>bindgen!</code>. I suspect that some code in <code>bindgen!</code> forgets to import <code>Box</code> when a WIT spec is inlined. In my own example that imports from a WIT file, there's no problem. In the example 4 where async is not used, it's also fine. I have no clue why that happened. The difference between <code>_7_async.rs</code> and <code>_4_imported_resources.rs</code> is just the line <code>async: true,</code></p>\n</blockquote>",
