Let's acknowledge that the effort to do so is not practical for us, and focus our vetting efforts on crates that developers and users are more likely to build.</p>\n<p>This reduces our estimated audit backlog by over three million lines, according to <code>cargo vet suggest</code>.</p>\n<p>Note that our crates which depend on those engines, such as wasmtime-fuzzing, are not published to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>, so if we fall victim to a supply chain attack against dependencies of these crates, the folks who might be impacted are limited.</p>\n<p>Although there is value in also auditing code that might be run by people who clone our git repository, in this case I propose that anyone who is concerned about the risks of supply chain attacks against their development systems should be running fuzzers inside a sandbox. After all, it's a fuzzer: it's specifically designed to try to do anything.</p>\n<p>I'd like to especially seek comment from folks who've expressed interest in our use of cargo-vet, like @alexcrichton, @bholley, @cfallin, and @tschneidereit. I'm open to being persuaded that we shouldn't make this change, but I can't currently see that we get any value from auditing these particular dependencies.</p>\n</blockquote>",
