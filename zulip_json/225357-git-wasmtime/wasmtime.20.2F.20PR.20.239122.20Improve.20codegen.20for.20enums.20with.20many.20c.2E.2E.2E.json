This is done by optimizing for enums specifically rather than handling them generically like other variants which can reduce the amount of code going into rustc to O(1) instead of O(N) with the number of cases. This in turn can greatly reduce compile time.</p>\n<p>The tradeoff made in this commit is that enums are now required to have <code>#[repr(...)]</code> annotations along with no Rust-level discriminants specified. This enables the use of a <code>transmute</code> to lift a discriminant into Rust with a simple bounds check. Previously this was one large <code>match</code> statement.</p>\n<p>Closes #9081</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
