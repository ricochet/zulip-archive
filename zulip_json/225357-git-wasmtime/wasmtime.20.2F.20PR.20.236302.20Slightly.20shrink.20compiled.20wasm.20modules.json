Additionally trampolines are no longer given a higher alignment requirement than is required by the ISA as is given to functions since they're not perf critical.</p>\n<p>The savings here are quite minor, only 0.3% locally on spidermonkey.wasm.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
