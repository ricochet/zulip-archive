This commit centralizes all of these helpers to one section of <code>inst.isle</code> to make it a bit easier to organize them and more clear where to add new ones.</p>\n<p>A few minor refactorings were performed as well for two new constructors which are now used in instruction lowerings.</p>\n</blockquote>",
