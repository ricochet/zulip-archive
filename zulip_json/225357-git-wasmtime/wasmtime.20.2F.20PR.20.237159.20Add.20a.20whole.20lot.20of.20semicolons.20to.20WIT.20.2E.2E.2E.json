This led me to add quite a few semicolons in quite a few places in what is going to be the first of a few batches of semicolons.</p>\n<p>CI checks for this cannot be added just yet because the wasi-nn spec is a submodule which needs to be updated with semicolons before this repository can require semicolons. Nevertheless that doesn't stop us from using semicolons in the meantime (yay gradual rollout of changes!) so I figure this would be good to get in sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
