To fix this the conversion to a static memory<br>\nimage has been updated to first do a conversion to paged memory<br>\ninitialization, which is sparse, followed by a second conversion to<br>\nstatic memory initialization.</p>\n<p>The sparse construction for the paged step should make it such that the<br>\nupper/lower bounds of the initialization image are easily computed, and<br>\nthen afterwards this limit can be checked against some heuristics to<br>\ndetermine if we're willing to commit to building up a whole static image<br>\nfor that module. The heuristics have been tweaked from \"must be less<br>\nthan 1GB\" to one of two conditions must be true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Either the total memory image size is at most twice the size of the<br>\n  original paged data itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Otherwise the memory image size must be smaller than a reasonable<br>\n  threshold, currently 1MB.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We'll likely need to tweak this over time and it's still possible to<br>\ncause a lot of extra memory consumption, but for now this should be<br>\nenough to appease the fuzzers.</p>\n<p>Closes #3815</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
