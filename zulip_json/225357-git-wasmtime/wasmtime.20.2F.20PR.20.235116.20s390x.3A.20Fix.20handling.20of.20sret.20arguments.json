Fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5089\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5089</a></p>\n<p>CC @cfallin </p>\n<p>This mirrors the implementation in <code>gen_call_common</code>, and does fix the actual crash.  I still think this could be improved further:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's unfortunate that whether or not a synthetic <code>StructReturn</code> was added cannot be discovered solely from looking at the <code>Sig</code> (or <code>SigData</code>) - at the moment you always have to look at the <code>SigRef</code> as well.</li>\n<li>There appears to be a discrepancy between <code>call_clobbers</code>, which considers <em>all</em> <code>StructReturn</code> return values as clobbers, and <code>gen_call_common</code>, which only skips those <code>StructReturn</code>s that were added by <code>missing_struct_return</code>.   Shouldn't these two be in sync?   (OTOH does any code ever actually have a <code>StructReturn</code> on the <em>return</em> list that isn't added by <code>missing_struct_return</code>?)</li>\n<li>This whole mechanism probably should be platform-specific anyway.  The fact that the incoming return-buffer address needs to be preserved in a return register is a property of the <em>Intel</em> ABI only - AFAIK none of the other ABIs we support have that requirement (s390x certainly does not).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
