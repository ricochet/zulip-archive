Stack usage can be worse than one might expect because ISLE is called from a build script, and those are always built in debug mode.</p>\n<p>This commit avoids the problem by using an explicit heap-allocated stack instead of recursion.</p>\n<p>I recommend turning on the \"ignore whitespace\" option in your diff tool of choice when reviewing this commit.</p>\n<p>The amount of stack space that this recursive function uses is affected by the version of rustc used to compile it, and the amount of stack space available depends on the host platform. As a result, this was only observed on Windows with a recent nightly version of rustc, but it could eventually affect other platforms or compiler versions, especially as ISLE rules grow in complexity.</p>\n<p>Note that there are several other places in ISLE which recurse over the user-provided rules. This commit does not change those, but they could also become a problem in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It is, of course, possible to pop the iterator and then push it back on if it is not empty (would require a peekable iterator) and this would be fine. But it might be more natural or \"simpler\" (depending on your taste) to instead push a separate stack entry for each item in the iterator. This latter approach doesn't require any extra is-it-done-or-not wrangling, which is kind of nice. It does use probably mean more entries pushed onto the stack and therefore potentially a larger heap allocation, but I don't think that matters at all here.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't think the result can be honestly said to be clear, but I agree that it's less unclear than it was before <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span> </p>\n<p>It's actually important to have some special treatment of the end of a list of cases or match-arms: we need to print some stuff and reset some state about what's still in scope. So if I take your suggestion of pushing each case/arm individually onto the stack, I also would need to push something like <code>Nested::EndBlock { last_line, scope }</code> first, which is certainly possible but is a fair bit more complexity each time stuff gets pushed onto the stack. Since that happens in more places (five) than calls to <code>end_block</code> (two), I feel like that's overall worse. But I'm still open to suggestions, and also may think differently about this after I get some sleep.</p>\n</blockquote>",
