Instead, we can use the generated <code>GraphEncoding</code> type as the key to map to the right implementation.</p>\n<p>Also, this PR adopts the <code>Wrapper(Box&lt;dyn ...&gt;)</code> pattern everywhere, which now includes backends and registries. Since wasi-nn accepts multiple implementations for all of these things, we need a way to virtually dispatch to the right implementation. Previously we used the <code>Box&lt;dyn ...&gt;</code> type explicitly in many places but this change opts to use a wrapper around this, expecting users to create the wrapper via <code>From</code> and <code>Into</code> and internally accessing the implementation via <code>Deref</code> and <code>DerefMut</code>. The idea is to eliminate some of the \"type clutter;\" let me know if you agree. </p>\n</blockquote>",
