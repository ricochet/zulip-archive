We were accidentally also enabling this operation for floats without first moving the float to an integer register. This caused a regalloc error since we can't use those instructions directly on floats.</p>\n<p>I've also tried to restrict the matches for some other rules that could probably suffer the same issue. Though the fuzzer hasn't complained about those yet.</p>\n</blockquote>",
