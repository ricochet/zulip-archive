I was politely informed that I would need to open a discussion about merging it here, or else my PR would <em>not</em> be merged (even though this PR does not in fact touch wasmtime in any way and is completely unrelated to it). So, this issue is for the discussion for merging that PR. The PR does not modify any behavior of wasmparser or wasmtime, nor does it alter the development flow of (any) new developers (although they will simply have to avoid certain dependencies). However, that shouldn't be a problem, since wasmtime is an incremental wasm parser, and is media-agnostic as to where the wasm comes from.<br>\nThe PR alters the dependency tree of wasmparser by adding the <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/no-std-compat\">no-std-compat</a> and an <code>extern crate</code> declaration above all use declarations in <a href=\"http://lib.rs\">lib.rs</a>. Additionally, I added a feature called <code>std</code> to facilitate the importation of <code>libstd</code>, and enabled it by default. Other than that, the code for the library is identical. This nullifies any reasons not to add no-std support to wasmparser, at minimum. CD/CI builds can be satisfied by adding another task to bench/test the wasmparser crate without any default features and with only the deterministic feature but not <code>default</code>/<code>std</code>.<br>\nCrates that should be avoided in wasmparsers development are typically any crates that depend on modules within <code>libstd</code> that aren't also in <code>liballoc</code> or <code>libcore</code>. (This is mitigated a bit by emulating mutexes/locks with spin and hashmaps with hashbrown, but things that touch the filesystem, networking, threads, processes, etc., should be avoided.) However, as I said previously I don't foresee any reason why wasmparser would ever need any of this functionality.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In fact in the past it used to have it (there is still a feature flag), but it was left bitrotting. Only the final step to mark the jitted code as executable requires OS support, but the embedder is the one responsible for this anyway. It can do the respective OS call or page table manipulation itself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is possible other features developed in the future for wasmparser may also have no #![no_std] equivalent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can't imagine what kind of feature for a parser would need an OS to function. In addition having a parser directly interact with the OS seems like a recipe for a security issue to me. In any case it is possible to provide an <code>std</code> feature flag to enable libstd usage and then gate this feature behind the feature flag.</p>\n</blockquote>",
