I've separated out each dependency by commit to see what's going on. The biggest upgrades were <code>syn 2.x.x</code>, <code>clap 4.x.x</code>, and <code>bitflags 2.x.x</code>. All the other updates were mostly minor.</p>\n<p>In terms of vetting I've added a number of new trusted annotations crates that are authored by those we already trust (e.g. me, Dan, epage, etc). I've additionally performed a variety of audits for new versions that aren't covered by our preexisting policies.</p>\n<p>At some point we need to revisit <code>cargo deny</code>'s configuration because we have quite a few duplicated dependencies which aren't being caught by <code>cargo deny</code> and I'm not entirely sure why. I think that our ignore list is too aggressive and/or not interacting well with how <code>cargo deny</code> works. I'll try to poke at this in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>",
