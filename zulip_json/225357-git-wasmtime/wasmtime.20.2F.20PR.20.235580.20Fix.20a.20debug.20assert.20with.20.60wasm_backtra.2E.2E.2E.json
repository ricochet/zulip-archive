The fix here is to update the condition of the debug assertion and add a test doing this behavior to ensure it works in the future.</p>\n<p>I've also further taken the liberty in this commit to remove the deprecation notice for <code>Config::wasm_backtrace</code>. We don't really have a strong reason for removing this functionality at this time and users have multiple times now reported issues with performance that seem worthwhile to keep the option. The latest issue, #5577, has a use case where it appears the quadratic behavior is back in a way that Wasmtime won't be able to detect. Namely with lots of wasm interleaved with host on the stack if the original error isn't threaded through the entire time then each host error will trigger a new backtrace since it doesn't see a prior backtrace in the error being returned.</p>\n<p>While this could otherwise be fixed with only capturing one contiguous backtrace perhaps this seems reasonable enough to leave the <code>wasm_backtrace</code> config option for now.</p>\n<p>Closes #5577</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
