It's not necessary to probe that partial page, just like it's unnecessary to probe at all if the frame is smaller than one page. Either way, any signal handler needs to be prepared for stack accesses on that last page to fault at any time during the function's execution.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Kind of unfortunate it would need to be copied to all the other inline probestack code paths.
