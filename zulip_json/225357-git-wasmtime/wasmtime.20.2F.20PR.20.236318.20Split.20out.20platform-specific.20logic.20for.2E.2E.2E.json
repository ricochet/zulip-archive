I plan in the near future to add a faux implementation for <code>cfg(miri)</code> to get some tests running with miri on CI.</p>\n<p>At the same time this additionally updates the interface of <code>Mmap</code> to be more miri-friendly in the sense of ensuring that mutability is all in the right place and we don't eagerly mark items as safe too soon. For example it seems questionable that previously you could get a mutable slice to readonly memory. Probably not going to cause any issues, but this interface should hopefully be more verification-friendly.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
