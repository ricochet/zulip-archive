You're likely running up against a version mismatch between what the adapter wants and what the runtime is expecting. Here for example it seems like the adapter wants <code>0.2.0-rc-2023-11-05</code> which I think means that you're using the <code>dev</code> tag and its adapter. Wasmtime 15, which isn't released yet, implements this. Wasmtime 14, however, which is released, does not implement this version. Hence I want to confirm whether you're using Wasmtime 14 or 15. </p>\n<p>If you're using Wasmtime 14 then you can download the adapters from <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v14.0.4\">here</a></p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm not sure how best to handle that. For example the world in that snippet does not include WASI, so technically feeding in a component that uses WASI correctly reports an error (the error message can definitely be improved). So from a \"what went wrong where\" perspective the error is a big higher up than the example because either the world isn't correct or the component isn't correct. From a more practical perspective though almost all components will import WASI, so it would also make sense to showcase there. Hence me not being entirely sure how best to handle this.</p>\n</blockquote>",
