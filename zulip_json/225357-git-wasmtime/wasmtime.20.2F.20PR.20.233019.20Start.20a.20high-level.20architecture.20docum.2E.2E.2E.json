On the one hand, users of Wasmtime don't really need to know about internals and where the safe vs unsafe line is drawn. On the other hand, contributors should (perhaps with guidance from reviewers) always strive for \"proper\" safety design/annotations, even if the current code doesn't fully live up to that in some area. I think we could expand / make explicit this second point, but what is written here seems like it will</p>\n<ul>\n<li>unnecessarily scare users of wasmtime, and</li>\n<li>let new contributors think that it is \"okay\" to be lax about safety boundaries because they've picked up the impression that everyone else is being lax too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don't think we intend for either of those things.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Do you know if it's one of those two?</p>\n<p>I personally find no use for one-liner readmes that explain nothing beyond the title of the crate, and I personally find it to be a worse experience not seeing a README in the first place and getting my hopes up that one exists. It's similar to the feeling of a function's documentation not explaining anything beyond the name of the function.</p>\n<p>I also find that these sorts of README.md files which aren't at the root level of a repository are perennially neglected. If we really want to add documentation to these crates I think we should do it in a centralized location (the book) and more technical details would go in the source itself (e.g. a large crate doc comment)</p>\n</blockquote>",
