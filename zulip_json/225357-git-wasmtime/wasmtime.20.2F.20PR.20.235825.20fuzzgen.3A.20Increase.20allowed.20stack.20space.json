He had previously run fuzzgen on s390x and that sort of error should have been found. But it wasn't because we never generate large offsets in our stack accesses.</p>\n<p>This PR allows larger stack slots that let us explore these larger offsets and hopefully more errors like this.</p>\n<p>I've picked <code>8192</code> somewhat arbitrarily, it's the next largest power of two after <code>4096</code> which i suspect might be the more troublesome value, although this probably depends on the ISA.</p>\n<p>With <code>8192</code> we have a max stack usage per function of <code>8 * 8192 = 65536</code>. And with #5765 we generate at most 8 functions, so worst case <code>8 * 8 * 8192 = 524288</code> which still seems fairly reasonable.</p>\n<p>Opening this as a draft because it has already found issues on the AArch64 backend! (#5824)</p>\n</blockquote>",
