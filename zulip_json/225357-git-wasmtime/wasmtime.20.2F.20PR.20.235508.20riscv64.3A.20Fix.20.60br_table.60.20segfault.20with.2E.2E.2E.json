Instead of always jumping to the default block when we have a jump table with 0 targets we would try to compute an offset past the end of the table.</p>\n<p>This sometimes would not crash, but it would crash if the there was no block after the <code>br_table</code>, thus adding a cold block would cause a segfault.</p>\n<p>The actual fix is quite simple, do not count the default block as a jump table entry when computing the limits.</p>\n<p>This commit also does a bunch of cleanup and adding some comments to the <code>br_table</code> emission code.</p>\n<p>Fixes #5496<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
