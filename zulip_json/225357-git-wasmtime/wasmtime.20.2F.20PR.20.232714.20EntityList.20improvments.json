I factored out the code to remove the last element of a list into <code>remove_last</code>, which is used by both <code>remove</code> and <code>swap_remove</code>.</li>\n<li>Added <code>deep_clone</code> which copies all elements to a new list. This is difficult to implement efficiently otherwise since it requires mutable access to the list pool for one lists while reading from another list.</li>\n<li>Added <code>truncate</code> which efficiently shortens a list without needing to remove elements individually.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
