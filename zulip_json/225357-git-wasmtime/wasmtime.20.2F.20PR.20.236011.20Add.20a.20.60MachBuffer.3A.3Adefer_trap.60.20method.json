This is useful for backends which frequently use <code>TrapIf</code>-style opcodes. Currently a jump is emitted which skips the next instruction, a trap, and then execution continues normally. While there isn't any pressing problem with this construction the trap opcode is in the middle of the instruction stream as opposed to \"off on the side\" despite rarely being taken.</p>\n<p>With this method in place all the backends (except riscv64 since I couldn't figure it out easily enough) have a new lowering of their <code>TrapIf</code> opcode. Now a trap is deferred, which returns a label, and then that label is jumped to when executing the trap. A fixup is then recorded in <code>MachBuffer</code> to get patched later on during emission, or at the end of the function. Subsequently all <code>TrapIf</code> instructions translate to a single branch plus a single trap at the end of the function.</p>\n<p>I've additionally further updated some more lowerings in the x64 backend which were explicitly using traps to instead use <code>TrapIf</code> where applicable to avoid jumping over traps mid-function. Other backends didn't appear to have many jump-over-the-next-trap patterns.</p>\n<p>Lots of tests have had their expectations updated here which should reflect all the traps being sunk to the end of functions.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

Previously this would naturally happen due to the source location tracking but by moving these to the end the tracking is lost. It turns out we don't have anything in the wasm test suite testing this just yet! I've now added in source location tracking for deferred traps in addition to some more tests which require the logic to be here.</p>\n<p>So now to get back to your question, about deduplicating, maybe! The source location adds another vector by which this needs to be considered for deduplication, and it's pretty unlikely to get deduplicated with the source information (except for perhaps some of those x64 lowerings of float-to-int conversions which have a bunch of traps). With source locations considered too, though, I think it's safe to deduplicate in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>",
