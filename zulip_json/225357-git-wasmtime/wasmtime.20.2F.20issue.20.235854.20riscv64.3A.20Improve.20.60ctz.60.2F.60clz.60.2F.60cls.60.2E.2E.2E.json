I think it would help me if you can split this into smaller PRs. It looks like you already structured individual commits carefully, but I think the main thing I want in this case is to keep separate the movement of definitions from the actual changes in lowering.</p>\n<p>I'm open to alternative suggestions, but would you mind opening a new PR that moves existing definitions without changing them first? I'm hoping that makes the overall diff for _this_ PR easier to review as it should only have the actual logic changes.</p>\n<p>If that's too much trouble, I'm happy to discuss other ways to split this, or I can try to review it as-is, or we can see if @elliottt or @cfallin is up for reviewing it. My trouble is that since I'm not familiar with risc-v I have to figure that out at the same time as following the motion of existing code and finding the real changes, and together that's apparently a bit too much for my brain.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I haven't authored enough backend rules to have an opinion myself though. My first reaction had originally been that it seemed like a lot of work with an unclear benefit, but I'm coming around to the conclusion that it's worth doing after all.</p>\n</blockquote>",
