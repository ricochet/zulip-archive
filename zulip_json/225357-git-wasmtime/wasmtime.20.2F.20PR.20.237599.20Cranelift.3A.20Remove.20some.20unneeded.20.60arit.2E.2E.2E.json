But if it's expected that patterns don't don't rely on canonicalization and it's better to keep these duplicates, then please just close this PR.</p>\n<p>(I needed to learn how to edit patterns and write+run tests against them for what I actually want to do, so this was a useful learning exercise for me whether it lands or not.)<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
