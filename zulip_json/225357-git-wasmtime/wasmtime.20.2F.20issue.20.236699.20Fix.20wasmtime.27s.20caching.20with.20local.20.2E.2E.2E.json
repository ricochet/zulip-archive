I guess we have some custom version serialization stuff now, not sure how relevant it is to this)</p>\n<p>One thing we could maybe do would be to add the hash of the whole executable to the cache key. This would be a big hammer, but would be pretty robust against any kind of local dirty state, or new commits on the same branch, or anything like that.</p>\n</blockquote>",
