These were pretty much already supported, but by default the x64 backend doesn't load sink small types. (It'd be neat to fix that at some point)</p>\n<p>The only change here is to allow it to do so for <code>movzx</code> and <code>movsx</code>. These instructions have the correct implementation for small types and shouldn't try to perform a load larger than the source type.</p>\n<p>This should also be the last backend that needs this implementation, s390x already supports this, so the next PR in this series is removing the <code>{u,s}loadNN</code> instructions from cranelift.</p>\n<p>CC: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6056\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6056</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
