These constructors take just an <code>&amp;Engine</code> and then access the underlying <code>TypeRegistry</code> as needed, effectively making that property hold statically.</p>\n<p>This is a minor clean up on its own, but is a big help for follow up work I am doing for Wasm GC and typed function references, where being able to grab a reference to the engine that a <code>FuncType</code> is registered within will prevent needing to thread in additional engine parameters to various places and then assert that the engine is the engine that the type is registered within, and etc...</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
