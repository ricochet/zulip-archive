This helps speed up the path from wasm into the host by avoiding branches at the start and the end of the execution. In a thread on [Zulip] this is locally leading to significant performance gains in this particular microbenchmark so having an option to disable it at the crate layer seems like a reasonable way to thread this needle for now. This definitely has a downside in that it requires a crate feature at all, but I'm not sure of a better solution as LLVM can't dynamically detect that <code>Store::call_hook</code> is never invoked and therefore the branch can be optimized away.</p>\n<p>[Zulip]: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime/topic/Performance.20regression.20since.20rust.201.2E65/near/444505571\">https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime/topic/Performance.20regression.20since.20rust.201.2E65/near/444505571</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Most of our Cargo features have been relatively low overhead to maintain so far. The main question to me is that this might be an appropriate feature to be off-by-default instead of on-by-default as it can affect benchmarks, but even then it's pretty rare anyone benchmarks host-to-wasm calls or vice versa, most benchmarking is just of the wasm itself.</p>\n</blockquote>",
