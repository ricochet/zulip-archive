In any case, it's an easy fix -- it appears that V8 added a new error message, so we need to add it to the allowlist of messages that we expect for a table out-of-bounds condition.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
