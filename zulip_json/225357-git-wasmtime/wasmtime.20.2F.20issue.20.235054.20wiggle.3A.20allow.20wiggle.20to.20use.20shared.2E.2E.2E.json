Or well it's not really specific to Rust per-se, but it's easiest to explain through Rust.</p>\n<p>Wiggle aggressively takes advantage of an internal borrow checker and handing out slices which point raw into wasm linear memory. This means that when the host gets <code>&amp;mut [u8]</code> or <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or <code>&amp;str</code> those are all pointers into raw wasm memory. While this is valid for single-threaded instances because the contents cannot change none of these Rust-based views are valid for shared memories because the contents can change at any time.</p>\n<p>All host-based processing of data stored in linear memory needs to change with shared memories. All loads/stores need to be atomic and additionally nothing can ever reside in the linear memory itself. For example if a wiggle API gives a string to the host then the host needs to copy out the string and then validate utf-8, whereas I think the opposite order happens today.</p>\n<p>I believe that solving this would require a fair bit of work and design within wiggle itself. Given the cost of atomic operations we probably can't do them by default. Additionally it may be too expensive to check \"is this shared memory\" at all interactions with linear memory from wiggle so having a runtime flag to process this may or may not be the best option as well.</p>\n<p>Overall I haven't really thought much about how to solve this problem. We've known about this for quite some time now but it's been a moot issue due to the lack of support for the <code>threads</code> proposal in Wasmtime. Also FWIW many of the same issues apply to supporting memory64 in WASI and additionally supporting either threads or memory64 in the component model support within Wasmtime.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We've known about this for quite some time now but it's been a moot issue due to the lack of support for the threads proposal in Wasmtime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One thought that I have had about this is to sequentialize host access from the WebAssembly threads, either by locking on _every_ host call. If this were done, then the Rust views to the underlying memory would be protected from concurrent modification. I looked for a way to do this <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/compare/main...abrown:wasmtime:wasi-threads\">here</a> but am still struggling to figure out how to tell a <code>Linker</code> to \"wrap every call with a <code>Mutex::lock</code>\" while still passing the expected WASI context type through <code>get_cx</code> without dropping the lock. It seems to me like some refactoring may be needed.</p>\n<p>The other idea I had was to lock calls within a WASI proposal, so that one could make concurrent calls to <code>wasi-common</code> and <code>wasi-nn</code>, e.g., but not within <code>wasi-common</code> itself. The motivation for this is that the contexts/states of each WASI proposal are distinct and there is no reason (along those lines) to lock everything. The point you raise above, however, suggests that locking is not just for protecting WASI contexts/states, but also to preserve the Rust expectations of the memory views used by host calls. So maybe I need to abandon this \"lock calls within a WASI proposal.\" </p>\n</blockquote>",
