It only needs to be reloaded in loops. So this commit eliminates the double-check on function entry.</p>\n<p>When Cranelift optimizations are enabled, the alias analysis pass correctly detected that this load was redundant, and the egraph pass optimized away the <code>icmp</code> as well. However, since we don't do conditional constant propagation, the branch couldn't be optimized away. On x86 this lowered to a redundant <code>cmp</code>/<code>jae</code> pair of instructions in every function entry, which this commit eliminates.</p>\n<p>To keep track of what code we're generating for epoch interruptions, I've also added disas tests with a trivial infinite loop.</p>\n</blockquote>",
