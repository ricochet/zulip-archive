Currently, the <code>wasmtime</code> API exposes possible failures as an <code>anyhow::Result</code>, which is akin to returning a String as an error. The conventional wisdom is that while <code>anyhow</code> is great for applications _consuming_ errors, it is more useful for libraries (which _produce_ errors) to define structured errors as enums, potentially using helper crates like <code>thiserror</code>. This is even [noted in the anyhow repo]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use Anyhow if you don't care what error type your functions return, you just want it to be easy. This is common in application code. Use thiserror if you are a library that wants to design your own dedicated error type(s) so that on failures the caller gets exactly the information that you choose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[noted in the anyhow repo]: <a href=\"https://github.com/dtolnay/anyhow#comparison-to-thiserror\">https://github.com/dtolnay/anyhow#comparison-to-thiserror</a></p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>Adding structured errors to the <code>wasmtime</code> API will allow for programmatic users to define logic to react to precise error<br>\nconditions, without resorting to parsing error strings. A specific use-case that I would benefit from having is being able to recognize when a module is missing a function export.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>It would be great to have one top-level <code>wasmtime::Error</code> error enum that divided the error space into discrete variants. The <code>thiserror</code> macro could be used to assist in generating the <code>Display</code> implementation for this type.</p>\n<p>A brief search through the <code>crates/wasmtime/</code> directory shows the following number of hits for <code>bail!</code> and <code>anyhow!</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>src/types/matching.rs</code>:<ul>\n<li>bail!: 24</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>src/module/serialization.rs</code>:<ul>\n<li>bail!: 17</li>\n<li>anyhow!: 3</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>src/externals.rs</code>:<ul>\n<li>bail! 9</li>\n<li>anyhow!: 2</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>src/linker.rs</code>:<ul>\n<li>bail! 8</li>\n<li>anyhow!: 1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>src/config.rs</code>:<ul>\n<li>bail!: 5</li>\n<li>anyhow!: 1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>src/instance.rs</code>:<ul>\n<li>bail! 5</li>\n<li>anyhow!: 1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>src/values.rs</code>:<ul>\n<li>bail!: 4</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>src/func/typed.rs</code>:<ul>\n<li>bail!: 3</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>src/func.rs</code>:<ul>\n<li>bail!: 3</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>src/store.rs</code>:<ul>\n<li>bail!: 2</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>src/trampoline/memory.rs</code>:<ul>\n<li>anyhow!: 1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This amounts to 83 <code>bail!</code> calls and 9 <code>anyhow!</code> calls, and does not account for errors that may be bubbled-up from internal or third-party crates using <code>?</code>. This is most probably too many instances to create unique variants for all of them, but if we take a closer look at some of these error instances, it becomes clear that we can probably bundle many of them into reusable variants. For example, there are the following <code>bail!</code>s:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">src</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span

There are probably other such groupings that can whittle down the number of error variants that would be necessary.</p>\n<h5>API Commitment</h5>\n<p>Creating a structured error type would expand the public API of the <code>wasmtime</code> crate, so it may be something that should be done incrementally, or in a future-proof way. One way to do this would be to make the Error enum <code>#[non_exhaustive]</code> so that callers must provide a catch-all when examining it. The initial version of the Error enum could expose some high-impact variants that are obviously useful to be able to inspect, and provide some sort of <code>Other</code> or <code>Unknown</code> case which could store any unclassified errors as an <code>anyhow::Error</code> like how things were done before.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>The most obvious alternative is to simply not adopt structured errors, or to not do so at this point in time. This would incur zero maintenance burden and retain the flexibility of being able to change error messages at any time, but would not provide the benefit to programmatic users described above.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This inline computation looks a lot like the higher-order iterator patterns seen in functional programming, e.g. <code>filter</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>fold</code>, and users fill in the implementation of each of these using a WebAssembly module that matches the signature expected in the higher-order function.</p>\n<p>To get a little bit more concrete on the interface of an individual WebAssembly module, a <code>filter</code> written by a user will essentially result in the following low-level Rust function being compiled as WASM:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">#[no_mangle]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"k\">extern</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"C\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">filter</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ptr</span>: <span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">len</span>: <span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"kt\">i32</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This code is generated by a procedural macro in the user's code, and is not written by the users themselves, so the user might write something high-level like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">#[smartstream(filter)]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">filter</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">record</span>: <span class=\"kp\">&amp;</span><span class=\"nc\">Record</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"nb\">Result</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"kt\">bool</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>However, if the user forgets the procedural macro to generate the low-level code exported at the WASM boundary, the Rust still compiles just fine, but it causes an error on the Streaming Processing Unit server when it tries to instantiate the WASM module and cannot find the function export called <code>filter</code>. We would like to be able to catch a \"missing function export\" error with confidence, rather than relying on parsing a stringified <code>anyhow::Error</code>. I.e., it would be nice to be able to do something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">filter_fn_result</span>: <span class=\"nb\">Result</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">TypedFunc</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">),</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">instance</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">get_typed_func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">base</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">store</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"filter\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">filter_fn</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">match</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">filter_fn_result</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nb\">Ok</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">filter_fn</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">filter_fn</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nb\">Err</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">wasmtime</span>::<span class=\"n\">Error</span>::<span class=\"n\">MissingExport</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// Remind the user to add `#[smartstream]` attribute</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nb\">Err</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">other</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// generic error handling</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One can inspect a module prior to instantiation to determine compatibility with the host, which isn't in the scope of the wasmtime API itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This sounds like it would probably be the best bet with our use-case, I'll have to explore more of the API to see how to inspect a module before instantiation.

Even if we did add an exhaustive listing of errors they're the most likely to change over time since precise errors often get different sorts of context and such like that. In that sense inspecting the module's interface is likely the most stable way to recognize this kind of error.</p>\n<p>That being said I do think that Wasmtime should make more use of concrete errors where helpful. I also want to stick to <code>anyhow::Error</code> if we can, but we can always provide public error types for downcasting as we do <code>Trap</code> for wasm traps. That could be used for specific errors and could also be done to recognize mismatches like this if we exported a particular error for this linking error.</p>\n</blockquote>",
