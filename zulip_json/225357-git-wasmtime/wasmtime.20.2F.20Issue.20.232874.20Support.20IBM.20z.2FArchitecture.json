I'll start reviewing soon; hopefully it won't take more than a week or two.</p>\n<p>As a general note for others -- we have talked about the CI situation here, and for now there is still a bit of a gap in qemu's z15 support, so we won't yet have this tested on CI and will have to trust the filetests instead. This will hopefully be improved at some point, but it shouldn't stop us from considering this merge now, IMHO.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'll have a look at the current state of qemu.  I'll also see if I can add support for z14, which would be useful anyway and might make it easier to use qemu.</p>\n</blockquote>",
