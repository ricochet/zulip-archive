We concluded that because most<br>\nhardware doesn't support it directly, it probably is not ideal to force<br>\nall backends to polyfill it. In the future we can always reverse this<br>\ndecision, perhaps with a platform-independent legalization.</p>\n<p>This PR restricts the allowed types on the CLIF ops to integer types<br>\nonly.</p>\n<p>Fixes #4104.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
