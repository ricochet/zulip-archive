This fills out<br>\nmissing pieces of functionality such as exporting modules as well. The<br>\nprevious translation code had initial support for translating imported<br>\nmodules but some of the AST type information was restructured with<br>\nfeedback from this implementation, namely splitting the<br>\n<code>InstantiateModule</code> initializer into separate upvar/import variants to<br>\nclarify that the item orderings for imports are resolved differently at<br>\nruntime.</p>\n<p>Much of this commit is also adding infrastructure for any imports at all<br>\ninto a component. For example a <code>Linker</code> type (analagous to<br>\n<code>wasmtime::Linker</code>) was added here as well. For now this type is quite<br>\nlimited due to the inability to define host functions (it can only work<br>\nwith instances and instances-of-modules) but it's enough to start<br>\nwriting <code>*.wast</code> tests which exercise lots of module-related functionality.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
