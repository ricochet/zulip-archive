The <code>wiggle</code>-generated implementations of <code>GuestTypeTransparent</code> were all unsafe in the face of shared memories since they do raw pointer reads/writes and needed treatment somehow. One option would be to switch to atomic loads as was done for primitive integers, but I opted instead to change the definition of <code>GuestTypeTransparent</code> to require \"all bits valid\" and then I went ahead and removed the auto-generated implementations. I don't think anything needs <code>GuestTypeTransparent</code>, or at least not in WASI today, and it otherwise represents the ambitions-at-the-time which have since been eclipsed by the component model.</p>\n</blockquote>",
