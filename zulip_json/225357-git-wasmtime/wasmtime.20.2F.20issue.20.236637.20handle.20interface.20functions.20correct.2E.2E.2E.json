I went for the linked list because I assumed there could be more than one sibling <code>LinkerInstance</code> alive at a a given moment and thus couldn't share the same <code>Vec</code>.

After reading Jamey's comments in more detail I would agree with his suggestion and I think that'd be an excellent refactoring to have. I poked at it for a moment but it was going to get somewhat nontrivial with the <code>matching</code> implementation where the list-of-instances needs to be passed around as context. Nothing insurmountable of course but it might be a bit of a nontrivial refactoring.</p>\n<p>I do think though that we won't be able to go to the constant-time implementation of this though because given the current API we always need to walk the path to the current instance in the provided <code>&amp;Component</code> to figure out the type.</p>\n<p>@jameysharp how would you feel about deferring your suggestion to an issue? (and/or how do you feel about the current state of the PR as well)</p>\n</blockquote>",
