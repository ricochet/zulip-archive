We get a good deal of fuzzing with oss-fuzz on Wasmtime, but our fuzz generators for wasm files aren't always the best (right now it's just <code>wasm-opt -ttf</code> which I think is somewhat limited). Do you know if it'd be possible to see if we could share generators for wasm files so we could leverage the oss-fuzz infrastructure to discover cases like this?</p>\n<p>(also we can move this to a separate issue to avoid cluttering up too much here)</p>\n</blockquote>",
