I am tempted to say \"go for it!\" but maybe there is some coordination needed. E.g., I think @jianjunz has started enabling some DirectML bits in #8756. And @devigned may have some opinions on the best way to do this. But from my perspective, this seems like a worthwhile avenue to pursue.</p>\n</blockquote>",
