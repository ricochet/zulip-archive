The lowering backend implicitly specified<br>\nthe order of successor edges via its <code>MachTerminator</code> enum on the last<br>\ninstruction in the block, while the <code>Lower</code> toplevel<br>\nmachine-independent driver set up blockparam branch args in the edge<br>\norder seen in CLIF.</p>\n<p>In some cases, these orders did not match -- for example, when the<br>\nconditional branch depended on an FP condition that was implemented by<br>\nswapping taken/not-taken edges and inverting the condition code.</p>\n<p>This PR refactors the successor handling to be centralized in <code>Lower</code><br>\nrather than flow through the terminator <code>MachInst</code>, and adds a<br>\nsuccessor block and its blockparam args at the same time, ensuring the<br>\norders match.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
