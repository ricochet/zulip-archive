Specifically for WebAssembly support, we only have to worry<br>\nabout the new stack slots convention. Stack slots don't need to be at<br>\nleast 8-bytes, they can be as small as the data type's size. For<br>\ninstance, if we need stack slots for (i32, i32), they can be located at<br>\noffsets (+0, +4). Note that they still need to be properly aligned on<br>\nthe data type they're containing, though, so if we need stack slots for<br>\n(i32, i64), we can't start the i64 slot at the +4 offset (it must start<br>\nat the +8 offset).</p>\n<p>Added one test that was failing on the Mac M1, as well as other tests<br>\nstressing different yet similar situations.</p>\n<p>Fixes #2734.</p>\n<p>(Note: more work will likely be needed to accommodate non-wasm uses: sign- or zero- extension of &lt; 32 bits arguments + i128 registers proper register passing. Happy to try PRs and confirm they work or not here.)</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm not a huge fan of generic terms like \"fast ABI\" because the ambiguity is confusing -- both on the user/embedder side (\"what guarantees does this have? how fast is fast? when can I use it?\") and on the implementer side (do we just choose an array of features that lead to better speed, and add more as we think of them? IMHO an evolving ABI is a recipe for subtle bugs as we mutate invariants over time).</p>\n<p>So I'd rather design a \"fast internal Cranelift ABI v1\", implement it, and then keep that as a first-class, well-defined ABI alongside the others, and retire names like \"fast\" and \"cold\", just for clarity's sake. But, that's a deeper discussion for another day, I think!</p>\n</blockquote>",
