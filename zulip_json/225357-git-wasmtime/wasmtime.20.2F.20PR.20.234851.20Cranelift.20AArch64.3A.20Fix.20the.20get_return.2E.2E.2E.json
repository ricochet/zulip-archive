The operation is valid only if the <code>preserve_frame_pointers</code> flag is enabled, which implies that the presence of a frame record on the stack is guaranteed.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think this is so that we know that <code>LR</code> is in a consistent state (the original signed return address), even if another <code>get_return_address</code> op had already been executed; is that right? And then it's safe to clobber below with <code>xpaclri</code> because <code>preserve_frame_pointers</code> implies that <code>LR</code> will be reloaded before return?</p>\n</blockquote>",
