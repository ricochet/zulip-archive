These two instructions currently<br>\nhave multiple branches in them to check for traps when the float is out<br>\nof bounds. This is additionally signaled via the <code>fflags</code> CSR however so<br>\nthis is an attempt to trim some branches/constants/etc and instead check<br>\nthe <code>fflags</code> CSR after the operation. This requires clearing the CSR<br>\njust beforehand, however. This additionally doesn't work for 8/16-bit<br>\ntypes because the hardware doesn't set flags for those.</p>\n</blockquote>",
