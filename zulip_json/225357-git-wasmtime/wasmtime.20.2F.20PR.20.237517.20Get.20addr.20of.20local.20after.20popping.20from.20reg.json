If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;<br>\nI observed in Winch that the offset from the stack pointer for locals written to with <code>local.set</code> and <code>local.tee</code> are slightly wrong when they are writing to a local that had been spilled by a prior operation. The cause appears to be that we get the address of the local (that is, the offset from the stack pointer) before invoking <code>self.context.pop_to_reg</code> and then use that address to perform the store operation. <code>self.context.pop_to_reg</code> may change the value of the stack pointer if the value on top of the stack is in memory. So the previously calculated stack pointer offset of the local may not be correct when storing a value into that address. This change has us calculate the address of the local (that is, the offset from the stack pointer) after invoking <code>self.context.pop_to_reg</code> to avoid that problem.</p>\n</blockquote>",
