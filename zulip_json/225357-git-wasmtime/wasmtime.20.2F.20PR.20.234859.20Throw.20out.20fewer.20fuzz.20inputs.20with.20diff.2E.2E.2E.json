This<br>\nmeant, however, that the candidate list of engines were filtered against<br>\nthe configuration used to generate the module to ensure that the<br>\nselected engine could run the generated module.</p>\n<p>This commit inverts this logic and instead selects an engine first,<br>\nallowing the engine to then tweak the module configuration to ensure<br>\nthat the generated module is compatible with the engine selected. This<br>\nmeans that fewer fuzz inputs are discarded because every fuzz input will<br>\nresult in an engine being executed.</p>\n<p>Internally the engine constructors have all been updated to update the<br>\nconfiguration to work instead of filtering the configuration. Some other<br>\nfixes were applied for the spec interpreter as well to work around #4852</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
