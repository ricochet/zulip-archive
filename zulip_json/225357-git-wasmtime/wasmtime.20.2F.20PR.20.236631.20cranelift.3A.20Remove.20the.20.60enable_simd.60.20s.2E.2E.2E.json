The setting is currently documented as enabling SIMD instructions, but that only sort of works for the x64 backend and none of the other backends look at it. Historically this was used to flag to Cranelift that a higher x64 baseline feature set is required for codegen but as of #6625 that's no longer necessary.</p>\n<p>Otherwise it seems more Cranelift-like nowadays to say that vector instructions generate SIMD instructions where non-vector instructions probably don't, but may still depending on activated CPU features. In that sense I'm not sure if a dedicated <code>enable_simd</code> setting is still motivated, so this PR removes it.</p>\n<p>This renames some features in the x86 backend such as <code>use_avx_simd</code> to <code>use_avx</code> since the <code>_simd</code> part is no longer part of the computation now that <code>enable_simd</code> is gone.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
