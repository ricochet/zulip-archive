(I realize you were trying to do something similar earlier but I think it makes sense to have both: the ISLE-level option to exclude from codegen completely, and the Cranelift-level custom trace macro. Probably we should make the codegen option a string option naming the trace macro...)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I like that idea a lot! Being able to control the name of the macro called would also make it easier to use this to instrument the generated rust, which we might be able to take advantage of during testing.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If that's true then there shouldn't be any runtime cost to including the logging calls, and actually I wonder if it should be a \"warn\" level log message or something.
