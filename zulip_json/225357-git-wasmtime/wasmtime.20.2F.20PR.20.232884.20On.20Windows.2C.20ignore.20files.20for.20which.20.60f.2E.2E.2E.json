These files wouldn't be openable in any other way by<br>\nWASI programs, so the only benefit of listing them would be to<br>\nlet applications know that they exist. This allows it to avoid failing<br>\nand avoid returning bogus results.</p>\n<p>This is part of a fix for <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std/issues/169\">bytecodealliance/cap-std#169</a>.<br>\n&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
