The example there switches between <code>ADDPS</code> (FP) and <code>PAND</code> (SIMD) and back to <code>ADDPS</code> (FP). So I would expect that to keep everything in the same domain, to follow the manual's example, we would need <code>ADDPS; ANDPS; ADDPS</code>. Or am I missing something?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since Andps already exists, is there any point in adding Andpd?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question still stands, though, and since I don't know of any penalty like the one mentioned (and I believe packed single floats and packed double floats to be in the same FP domain), then the assembler could avoid knowing about another instruction. But what is the benefit of that? We can always choose <code>ANDPS</code> in the lowering if we are concerned about code size? I would leave it in so that lowering users have the option to use it if it feels more natural.</p>\n<p>I think where I'm coming from (and I'm still developing this thought, so bear with me) is that at the assembler level, which is what we are talking about here, the best naming convention in the assembler code is one that matches the ISA naming convention 1:1. Instead of writing <code>Inst::XmmAbcDef(SseOpcode::Andps, ...)</code> (or its helper function) I am suggesting the abstraction should look more like <code>...::Andps(...)</code> so that we more directly think in the ISA namespace than in Cranelift's custom namespace. From that viewpoint, it makes sense to me to have more instruction variants available (e.g. <code>ANDPD</code>) to reduce friction during lowering. (I understand that's still not strongest argument for keeping <code>ANDPD</code> but I'm really thinking more about the ISA naming point... it was a bit frustrating to have to think in terms of an ad hoc convention instead when I was addding SIMD FP arithmetic support).</p>\n</blockquote>",
