        "content": "<p>fitzgen opened <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8933\">PR #8933</a> from <code>fitzgen:host-alloc-gc-objects</code> to <code>bytecodealliance:main</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This commit introduces the <code>wasmtime::StructRef</code> type and support for allocating Wasm GC structs from the host. This commit does <em>not</em> add support for the <code>struct.new</code> family of Wasm instructions; guests still cannot allocate Wasm GC objects yet, but initial support should be pretty straightforward after this commit lands.</p>\n<p>The <code>StructRef</code> type has everything you expect from other value types in the <code>wasmtime</code> crate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A method to get its type or check whether it matches a given type</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An implementation of <code>WasmTy</code> so that it can be used with <code>Func::wrap</code>-style APIs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ability to upcast it into an <code>AnyRef</code> and to do checked downcasts in the opposite direction</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are, additionally, methods for getting, setting, and enumerating a <code>StructRef</code>'s fields.</p>\n<p>To allocate a <code>StructRef</code>, we need proof that the struct type we are allocating is being kept alive for the duration that the allocation may live. This is required for many reasons, but a basic example is getting a struct instance's type from the embedder API: this does a type-index-to-<code>StructType</code> lookup and conversion and if the type wasn't kept alive, then the type-index lookup will result in what is logically a use-after-free bug. This won't be a problem for Wasm guests (when we get around to implementing allocation for them) since their module defines the type, the store holds onto its instances' modules, and the allocation cannot outlive the store. For the host, we need another method of keeping the object's type alive, since it might be that the host defined the type and there is no module that also defined it, let alone such a module that is being kept alive in the store.</p>\n<p>The solution to the struct-type-lifetime problem that this commit implements for hosts is for the store to hold a hash set of <code>RegisteredType</code>s specifically for objects which were allocated via the embedder API. But we also don't want to do a hash lookup on every allocation, so we also implement a <code>StructRefPre</code> type. A <code>StructRefPre</code> is proof that the embedder has inserted a <code>StructType</code>'s inner <code>RegisteredType</code> into a store. Structurally, it is a pair of the struct type and a store id. All <code>StructRef</code> allocation methods require a <code>StructRefPre</code> argument, which does a fast store id check, rather than a whole hash table insertion.</p>\n<p>I opted to require <code>StructRefPre</code> in all allocation cases -- even though this has the downside of always forcing callers to create one before they allocate, even if they are only allocating a single object -- because of two reasons. First, this avoids needing to define duplicate methods, with and without a <code>StructRefPre</code> argument. Second, this avoids a performance footgun in the API where users don't realize that they <em>can</em> avoid extra work by creating a single <code>StructRefPre</code> and then using it multiple times. Anecdotally, I've heard multiple people complain about instantiation being slower than advertised but it turns out they weren't using <code>InstancePre</code>, and I'd like to avoid that situation for allocation if we can.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
