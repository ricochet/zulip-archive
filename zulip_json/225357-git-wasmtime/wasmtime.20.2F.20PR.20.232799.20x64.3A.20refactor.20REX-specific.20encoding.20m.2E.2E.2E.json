It would make it a bit easier to test and perhaps this code could be useful elsewhere?)</li>\n<li>implement a few more abstractions like <code>RexFlags</code> to make this easier to work with (again, why not? Rust == \"zero-cost abstractions,\" right? <span aria-label=\"grinning\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning\">:grinning:</span>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any thoughts for or against this?</p>\n</blockquote>",
