It's common for users to<br>\nredirect stdio streams to interesting places, and applications<br>\ngenerally shouldn't change their behavior depending on the size or<br>\ntimestamps of the file, if the streams are redirected to a file, so just<br>\nleave these fields to 0, which is commonly understood to represent<br>\n\"unknown\".</p>\n<p>Fixes #4497.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
