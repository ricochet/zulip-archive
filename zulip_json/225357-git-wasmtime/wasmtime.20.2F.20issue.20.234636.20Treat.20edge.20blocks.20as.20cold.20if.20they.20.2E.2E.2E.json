However, simple cases may never need to jump back to a shared block, so don’t require an edge-block on outgoing edges.</p>\n<p>In 2., the cold block only as a single incoming edge so doesn’t require any moves to occur along the incoming edge (at least as well as I can understand). However, since the cold path rejoins the hot path, it frequently requires an edge block on the outgoing edge to ensure that the values.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, I was only thinking of 2. when I changed the

existing cold-blocks test: <code>isa::x64::test::test_cold_blocks</code>), is that there is a subtle interaction of this change with trivial edges (i.e., edges without any moves) that occur when the

However, simple cases may never need to jump back to a shared block, so don’t require an edge-block on outgoing edges.</p>\n<p>In 2., the cold block only as a single incoming edge so doesn’t require any moves to occur along the incoming edge (at least as well as I can understand). However, since the cold path rejoins the hot path, it frequently requires an edge block on the outgoing edge to ensure the values are in the same place as the hot path.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, I was only thinking of 2. when I changed the heuristic (to attempt to solve the issue below), so my intuition was that there would never be an edge-block that contained any move operations for incoming edges to cold blocks.</p>\n<p>An issue I observed (as a result of the existing cold-blocks test: <code>isa::x64::test::test_cold_blocks</code>), is that there is a subtle interaction of this change with trivial edges (i.e., edges without any moves) that occur when the cold path is reached as part of an untaken branch.</p>\n<p>e.g., if we have:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">block0</span>:\n    <span class=\"nc\">brnz</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">block2</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">jump</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">block1</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">block1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">cold</span>:\n    <span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">....</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">block2</span>:\n    <span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If block1 is shared, then Cranelift seems to generate something equivalent to the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">block0</span>:\n    <span class=\"nc\">brnz</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">v1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">block2</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">jump</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">block0_to_block1_edge</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">block0_to_block1_edge</span>:\n    <span class=\"nc\">jump</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">block1</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">block1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">cold</span>:\n    <span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">....</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">block2</span>:\n    <span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Normally the redundant <code>block0_to_block1_edge</code> jump is eliminated because it acts as a \"fallthrough\" to the next block, however if it gets marked as cold then it is no longer a fallthrough block and we end up with a redundant jump, e.g., see the branch at 0x23 below:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"

annotation to incoming edges would fix the redundant branch (in combination with my assumption that all edges to cold blocks would not contain any moves). However, this is not really the case, and the same issue can crop up in the cold-&gt;hot edge case as well.</p>\n<p>In summary: I think it makes sense to re-enable the heuristic for edges with cold blocks as successors, however in both cases we can end up with a redundant edge in some cases.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If you want to dig into it further, in addition to the RPO sort you see in <a href=\"http://blockorder.rs\">blockorder.rs</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/0b1f51f80427a79fbd7d77849f7e2301a1d128f5/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/vcode.rs#L768-L778\">this</a> code does the actual sinking at the last second, during emission (we do it this way because we need to generate vcode in postorder to see uses before defs).</p>\n<p>In the meantime I'd be happy to merge this with the heuristic returned to \"edge is cold if pred or succ is cold\"; that seems pretty reasonable and robust to me.</p>\n</blockquote>",
