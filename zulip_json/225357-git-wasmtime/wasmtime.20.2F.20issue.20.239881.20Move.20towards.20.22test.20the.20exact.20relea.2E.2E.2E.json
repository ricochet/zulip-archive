Currently the actual released artifacts are not actually tested in CI at all, they're simply produced. This isn't a great situation and ideally we would test the exact artifacts that CI produces rather than a different build configuration.</p>\n<p>There's a few challenges to tackle when handling this though:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most of the test suite is not architected to run the <code>wasmtime</code> CLI or the <code>libwasmtime.so</code> C API. Some of <code>tests/all/cli_tests.rs</code> runs the <code>wasmtime</code> executable, but the executable is produced as part of <code>cargo test</code> and isn't a released artifact. The C API is only tested through the C examples (so very lightly).</li>\n<li>Testing artifacts might require a different command to execute or new infrastructure other than <code>cargo test</code>. It's unclear what this infrastructure would look like.</li>\n<li>Testing \"all possible configurations\" isn't feasible, even with the generous concurrency that we already have. For example we can't test the matrix of {platform, opt/debug, debug-asserts/no, crate} in CI as that would be too much.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We didn't reach many firm conclusions in the meeting but I wanted to open a follow-up issue to track further progress. A few points we did identify were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We should probably have one CI job test with <code>--release</code> to test with optimizations (just one platform though, probably not all of them)</li>\n<li>We should ideally run at least a \"smoke test\" for released artifacts. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>cc @tschneidereit </p>\n</blockquote>",
