Besides having many fewer cases now, this should also fix part of the bug that #8393 addresses, but that PR fixes other issues as well.</p>\n<p>This PR changes the operand size that we emit for some cases from 32-bit to 64-bit. In those cases, the operand size doesn't matter because we want the upper 32 bits to be zero. We set them that way with the initial instruction: widening <code>movz</code> from 32-bit to 64-bit doesn't change anything. And we preserve the upper bits with subsequent <code>movk</code> instructions, instead of zeroing them, but they were already zero.</p>\n</blockquote>",

There are some choices we could make which would synthesize the same constants using a different sequence of instructions, but in almost all cases we'd produce the same number of instructions, so it doesn't make much difference. This algorithm is simple and produces readable disassembly listings so we might as well preserve the existing behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>",
