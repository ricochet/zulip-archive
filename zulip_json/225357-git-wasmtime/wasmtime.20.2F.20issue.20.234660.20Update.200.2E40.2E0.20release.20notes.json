Building the <code>bench-api</code> crate with <code>--no-default-features</code>, notably disabling the <code>shuffling-allocator</code>, shows that <code>bz2</code> and <code>pulldown-cmark</code> had no changes in compile time and <code>spidermonkey</code>/<code>intgemm-simd</code> had very small changes (&lt;5%), so not worth calling out in the relnotes</p>\n</blockquote>",
