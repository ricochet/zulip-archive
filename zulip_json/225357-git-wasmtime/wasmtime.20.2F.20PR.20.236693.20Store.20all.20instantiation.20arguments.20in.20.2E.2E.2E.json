Previously a list of import arguments was \"unzipped\" into a list of modules and a list of functions. This is becoming a bit more cumbersome in an upcoming change for resources where a third style of import is being added, so instead of this unzipping operation this commit instead replaces the list of imports with an <code>Arc</code>. This way instantiation is actually a bit cheaper since only one <code>Arc</code> needs to be retained instead of each individual argument imported into a module.</p>\n<p>Additionally this refactors the way that exported modules are handled by avoiding translating everything into one list and instead continuing to store modules in two separate lists: those in the component and those imported.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

This is a pattern used commonly throughout the core wasm implementation as well though (which also isn't necessarily thoroughly documented).</p>\n<p>One difficulty is that it's not easy to tie the data structure's types to \"oh yes here's the point where the <code>unsafe</code> block is ok\" since the unsafety is so pervasive. Or at least right now with our current organization I'm not aware of a \"single spot\" but rather the whole codebase assumes a store lives forever and everything needed by anything in a store must be rooted in the store somehow.</p>\n</blockquote>",
