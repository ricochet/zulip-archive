This means that if a failure is quickly encountered it doesn't wait for the entire workflow to finish just to report the failure, clearing out the queue of failing PRs faster. This doesn't work well on Windows runners though where often the cancellation and marking the job as failed race. The winner of the race is often the cancellation which means that there's no listed failure in 100+ jobs which can be frustrating.</p>\n<p>Instead centralize this cancellation logic in one helper and additionally add a condition where it doesn't cancel on Windows platforms. That means that failures on windows won't be fail-fast, but that's sort of the best that we can do for now.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
