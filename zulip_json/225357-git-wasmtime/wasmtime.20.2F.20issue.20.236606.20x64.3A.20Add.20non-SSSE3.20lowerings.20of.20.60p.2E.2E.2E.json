Turns out that Cranelift previously didn't correctly implement the Windows fastcall calling convention with respect to vector arguments since they're all supposed to be indirect rather than immediate in registers (unlike System-V). That motivated me to remove the usage of <code>lower_pshufb</code> and the usage of a libcall, ending up in an SSE2 lowering for <code>i8x16.popcnt</code> that's not the end of the world. I couldn't find a way to avoid the libcall for <code>shuffle</code> or <code>swizzle</code>, though, so I doubled down on fixing it. I've attempted to add the ABI bits here to get that working, but more eyes are of course always appreciated.</p>\n</blockquote>",
