Would you be up for updating the rule added in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7131\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7131</a> as well to match this rule in terms of consistency? I tried to put everything in ISLE in that PR but I like how this PR turned out as well so that may not have been the best option.</p>\n<p>I was initially quite perplexed as I thought that this should have already been handled by <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7131\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7131</a> and the \"aha!\" moment was realizing that there has to be at least 12 trailing zeros since the immediate starts at higher bits. I think being able to see that difference in ISLE might be kind of nice.</p>\n<p>No worries either way though, this is a nice improvement, so thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
