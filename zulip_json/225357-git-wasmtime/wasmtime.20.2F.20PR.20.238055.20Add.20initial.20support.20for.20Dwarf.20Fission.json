DWARF fission has advantages in linking and wasm size (<a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/faster-wasm-debugging\">https://developer.chrome.com/blog/faster-wasm-debugging</a>) as it separates the debug_info section into a separate file leaving a <code>DW_TAG_skeleton_unit</code> in the main wasm file.   </p>\n<p>This PR only supports DWARF pacakges, <code>.dwp</code> files.  It should also be possible to support<code>.dwo</code> files, but I've not done that here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
