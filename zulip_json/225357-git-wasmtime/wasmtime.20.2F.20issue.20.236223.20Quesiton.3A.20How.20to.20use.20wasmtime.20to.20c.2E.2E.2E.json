As you've found the <code>--target</code> CLI flag which maps to <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.target\"><code>Config::target</code></a> is how to cross compile. Additionally as you've found cross-compilation is currently disabled by default but can be enabled at compile time with the <code>--features all-arch</code> flag.</p>\n</blockquote>",
