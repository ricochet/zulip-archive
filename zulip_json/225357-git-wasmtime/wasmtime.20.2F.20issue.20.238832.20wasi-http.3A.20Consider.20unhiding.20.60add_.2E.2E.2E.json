I work on the AWS Rust SDK and I maintain our <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/aws-smithy-wasm\">aws-smithy-wasm</a> crate. This includes a <a href=\"https://docs.rs/aws-smithy-wasm/0.1.3/aws_smithy_wasm/wasi/struct.WasiHttpClient.html\">WasiHttpClient</a> for sending outbound HTTP calls to AWS services. So the full <code>proxy</code> world is overkill for my needs and I would prefer to link in the minimal set of interfaces that I need. </p>\n<p>That seems possible today with the <code>add_to_linker_get_host</code> functions, but I haven't had time to go through and figure out what I actually need to implement for the <code>host_getter</code> yet.</p>\n</blockquote>",
