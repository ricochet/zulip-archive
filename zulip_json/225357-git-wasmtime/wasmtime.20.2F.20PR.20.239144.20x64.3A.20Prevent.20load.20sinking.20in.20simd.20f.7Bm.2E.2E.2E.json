That triggered a panic in the backend since this isn't valid. The reason for this is due to how some ISLE rules were written where a <code>Value</code> was both implicitly coerced into an <code>XmmMem</code> and an <code>Xmm</code>. This issue is similar to #4815 for example. The fix in this commit is to force the operands into registers which prevents load sinking which wouldn't work here anyway.</p>\n<p>This panic was introduced in #5841 which is quite old at this point. This bug does not affect WebAssembly translation due to how the <code>v128</code> type maps to <code>i8x16</code> in Cranelift by default.</p>\n<p>Closes #9143</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
