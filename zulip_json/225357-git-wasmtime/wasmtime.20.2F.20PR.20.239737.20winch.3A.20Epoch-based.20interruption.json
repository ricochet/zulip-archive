The heuristics around epoch check emission are identical to Cranelift's except for the fact that the current implementation doesn't introduce a local-based cache for the current epoch deadline. This is an intentional decision given Winch's focus on compilation performance. However, if needed in the future, knobs could be introduced to optionally introduce a local cache at the cost of reduced compilation performance.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",

Just a couple nitpicks inline.</p>\n<p>Also I know that most of the testing will be covered by fuzzing and the existing epoch tests, but it may make sense to throw in a single disas test with epochs enabled as well that contains a some <code>if</code>s, <code>block</code>s, and a <code>loop</code> just to show that we insert epoch checks only on the loop headers and body prologue. Could also be used to see that deadlines are actually cached, if we ever get around to doing that here.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If so, ignore the following.</p>\n<p>If not, then I find it a little surprising. I thought maybe there was a <code>Var</code> type that abstracts over registers and stack slots or something. Or introduces a virtual register concept or something like that. I think a <code>_reg</code> suffix would have avoided me going down that line of thought and inquiry, which would make it slightly easier to follow what's going on, as a code reader.</p>\n</blockquote>",
