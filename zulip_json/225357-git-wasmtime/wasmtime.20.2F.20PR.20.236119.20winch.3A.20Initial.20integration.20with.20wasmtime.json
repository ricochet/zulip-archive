We've been manually running it's output in a test environment, but moving that over to <code>wasmtime</code> would greatly simplify the process.</p>\n</blockquote>",

One thing that I discovered though, is that everything works as expected if the <code>component-model</code> feature is passed to the <code>cargo doc</code> invocation in the github workflow, which would match the invocation that <a href=\"http://doc.rs\">doc.rs</a> will make according to docs metadata entry:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"TOML\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">[package.metadata.docs.rs]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">rustdoc-args</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">\"--cfg\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"nightlydoc\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">features</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">\"component-model\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>So I think that using the <code>component-model</code> feature in the CI workflow is preferred over using <code>winch</code> since this is what <a href=\"http://docs.rs\">docs.rs</a> will use for the documentation anyway. </p>\n<p>I was wondering if you'd be good with this change as a short term fix and I'll circle back with Alex when is back. </p>\n</blockquote>",
