From my tests it does function correctly, no unexpected crashes, so no code modifications were made. It uses the <code>ANDROID</code> CMake variable to transparently detect when Android compilation is being done and sets flags and some other environment variables accordingly. The environment variables are necessary for some crates (as far as I could tell). <code>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</code> might have to be off.</p>\n<p>Some relevant issues are #3867, #3877, #3921.</p>\n</blockquote>",
