This instruction uses a condition mask field as \"R1\", not an actual register field, and the contents are 15 (all mask bits set) to indicate a \"branch on any condition\", i.e. an unconditional branch.  It would have been clearer to add a variant of the <code>enc_rr</code> helper instead of passing the condition mask as a \"register\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and it has a debug assert that r14 is used as link register.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Huh, I'm surprised to see that.  Looks like @elliottt added a bunch of asserts here: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5172\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5172</a> - I'm not sure if there's anything in that diff that makes those asserts necessary?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What other OSes use a different link register?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, XPLINK (the current main calling convention on z/OS) uses %r4, as one major example.</p>\n<p>In general, I'm pretty sure in case we ever wanted to support a significantly different calling convention like XPLINK that uses different registers for the link register, the stack register, and pretty much any ABI-defined register, we will find places where the current code isn't fully generalized.  I tried to keep things general where it seemed easily possible, but didn't attempt any full review ...   I just don't see why it's beneficial now to make the code <em>less</em> general.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
