The machinst backends store everything in a <code>MachBuffer</code> before finally emitting the compiled code one byte at a time to the <code>CodeSink</code>. Unlike a plain <code>memcpy</code> this is not easily vectorizable. In addition there are a lot of branches to check if the current instruction has a relocation, can trap or is a call site.</p>\n<p>I propose that either the <code>CodeSink</code> interface is removed in favor of giving the embedder direct access to the <code>MachBufferFinalized</code> or the <code>CodeSink</code> interface will get a <code>put_bytes</code> function that allows copying all bytes at the same time in combination with explicit offsets for the <code>reloc_external</code>, <code>trap</code> and <code>add_call_site</code> methods.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Once that happens, I think we'll want to look over the codegen-crate interfaces generally to see if there are any other possible efficiency improvements like this one.</p>\n</blockquote>",
