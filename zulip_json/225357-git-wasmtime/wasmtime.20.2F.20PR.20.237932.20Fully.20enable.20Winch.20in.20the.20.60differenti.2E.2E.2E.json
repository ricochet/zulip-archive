I attempted enabling winch for the other fuzzers as well but Winch doesn't currently implement all methods for generating various trampolines required so it's currently only limited to the <code>differential</code> fuzzer.</p>\n<p>This adds Winch as an \"engine\" and additionally ensures that when configured various wasm proposals are disabled that Winch doesn't support (similar to how enabling <code>wasmi</code> disables proposals that <code>wasmi</code> doesn't support).</p>\n<p>This does reduce fuzzing of Winch slightly in that the reference-types proposal is completely disabled for Winch rather than half-enabled where Winch doesn't implement <code>externref</code> operations yet but does implement <code>funcref</code> operations. This, however, enables integrating it more cleanly into the rest of the fuzzing infrastructure with fewer special cases.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
