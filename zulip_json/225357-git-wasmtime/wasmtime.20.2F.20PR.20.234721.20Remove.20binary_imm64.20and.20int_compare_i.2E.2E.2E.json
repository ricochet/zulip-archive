The main issues are that there are a bunch<br>\nof tests I haven't fixed up, and some optimizations I've removed. Also I<br>\nhave no performance measurements yet to see what effect this has on<br>\neither compile time or generated code quality.</p>\n<p>I just wanted to understand what the <code>*_imm</code> instructions were used for,<br>\nand trying to grep for them didn't work out well. So I removed them to<br>\nlet the compiler tell me where they're used instead.</p>\n<p>To avoid having to make as many changes, I introduced a <code>InstImmBuilder</code><br>\ntrait. It provides methods like <code>iadd_imm</code> which emit the pair of<br>\ninstructions that legalization would have decomposed that instruction<br>\ninto eventually anyway.</p>\n<p>I have several questions that this may help with answering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Is there significant savings, in IR code size and/or compile time,<br>\n  from inlining one immediate operand into some instructions at the<br>\n  frontend? Or is the widespread frontend use of these instructions just<br>\n  for convenience?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can simple_preopt cleanly identify arithmetic identities involving<br>\n  constants without rewriting to use these combined forms?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is there a compile-time cost to simple_preopt rewriting into combined<br>\n  forms, only for legalization to rewrite them away again soon after?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
