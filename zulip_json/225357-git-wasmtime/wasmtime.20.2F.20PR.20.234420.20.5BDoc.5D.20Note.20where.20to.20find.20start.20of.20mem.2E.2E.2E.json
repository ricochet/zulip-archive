This is useful when needing to inspect the value referred to by a pointer. It wasn't immediately obvious to me how to figure out the location of the start of linear memory until I attempted to auto-complete <code>__vmctx-&gt;</code> in my debugger. Including this in the docs would make it more obvious.</p>\n<p>I have not opened an issue to discuss this since this seems like a very minor change.</p>\n<p>I do not know who to assign to this PR from the core maintainer team at this time.</p>\n</blockquote>",
