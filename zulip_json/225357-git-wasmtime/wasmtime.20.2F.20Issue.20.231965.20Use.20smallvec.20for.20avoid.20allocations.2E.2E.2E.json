I'm curious, though, would y'all be able to switch to using the <code>get*</code> family of functions? Not a whole lot of effort has gone into making <code>Func::call</code> (or <code>Func::new</code>) all that fast since it's imagined that most speed-critical usage would use <code>Func::wrap</code> and <code>Func::get*</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
