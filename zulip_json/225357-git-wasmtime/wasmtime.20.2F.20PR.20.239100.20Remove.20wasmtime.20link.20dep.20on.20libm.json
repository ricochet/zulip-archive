I'm not sure why, and at least in my project, we build without using the musl-gcc linker and everything works perfectly, and adopting that strategy broke something in a way I couldn't debug. So, I'd like it for CI to test the musl build with the default linker as well, to catch issues like this one. The CI matrix / docker configuration is pretty complicated and I was gonna consult with @alexcrichton on the best way to add this check.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm not sure why, ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is because our build containers are all Ubuntu so the default linker uses glibc instead of musl. The <code>musl-gcc</code> package is sort of a few wrapper scripts to tell the linker to link musl instead of glibc. In your distro it might be musl-based so this all happens by default perhaps?</p>\n<p>In any case looks good to me, now I'm not sure why I needed this but maybe I got something wrong while developing this and accidentally thought it was required.</p>\n</blockquote>",
