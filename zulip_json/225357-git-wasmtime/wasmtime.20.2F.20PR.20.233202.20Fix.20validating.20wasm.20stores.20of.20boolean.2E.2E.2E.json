Cranelift's <code>store</code> instruction, however, isn't valid for<br>\nboolean vector types. This commit fixes this issue by inserting a<br>\nbitcast specifically for the store instruction if a boolean vector type<br>\nis being stored, continuing to avoid the bitcast for all other vector types.</p>\n<p>Closes #3099</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

If we settle it once for all (do we have an issue for this?) and document it then it might make sense to avoid the bitcast (if that's what is decided).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
