In this commit I just narrowed the declarations to the specific<br>\nenum variants that were not used (as it seems reasonable to keep them<br>\nand their handling in all the matches, for future use). And the compiler<br>\nfound more dead code that I think we can remove safely in the short<br>\nterm.</p>\n<p>With this, the only files annotated with a module-wide<br>\n<code>allow(dead_code)</code> are isle-generated files.</p>\n</blockquote>",
