So I lean toward just accumulating one <code>Vec</code> for all the results and returning that. This isn't performance-critical, anyway.</p>\n<p>I think I'd prefer to verify that the <code>rv64</code> part is the first one, which we can't cleanly do in an iterator chain, but can do by calling <code>Iterator::next</code> directly.</p>\n<p>Finally, I fiddled around with different ways to get an iterator over single-character string slices.
