What this flag does is inform VTune about the JIT-compiled code so it can display it appropriately in the UI. We've had problems in the past with incorrectly telling VTune about this code which _did_ result in errors and that is what this test is checking: in effect, this is a regression test to check that we correctly tell VTune about the JIT code.</p>\n</blockquote>",
