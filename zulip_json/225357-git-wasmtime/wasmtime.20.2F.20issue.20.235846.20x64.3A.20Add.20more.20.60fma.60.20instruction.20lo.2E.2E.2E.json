These are pattern-matched where one of the arguments to the CLIF instruction is an <code>fneg</code>. I opted to not add a new CLIF instruction here since it seemed like pattern matching was easy enough but I'm also not intimately familiar with the semantics here so if that's the preferred approach I can do that too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'd generally prefer not to add CLIF instructions if it seems like we can get just as good of results without them. It sounds like that's the case here, so I think you made the right choice.</p>\n</blockquote>",
