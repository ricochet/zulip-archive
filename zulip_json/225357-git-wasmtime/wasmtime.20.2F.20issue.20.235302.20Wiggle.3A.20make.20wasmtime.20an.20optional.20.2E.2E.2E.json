The <code>wiggle</code> of old, as you've found, did this as it was multiplexing the Lucet and Wasmtime runtimes. Nowadays, however, the design of <code>wasi-common</code> is evolving, especially with an upcoming implementation of the preview2 snapshot of WASI. With all the shuffling going on we need to focus on the needs of Wasmtime and the component model right now. Once the dust settles I think it would be reasonable to look at this issue again and see where things are at and whether it can be reasonably supported. For now though I'm going to close this as this was something intentionally removed (with more information on Zulip as well in that linked thread)</p>\n</blockquote>",
