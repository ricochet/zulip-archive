The very non-controversial bits that just introduce a calling convention and tail call instructions, nothing that actually implements the calling conventions or supports lowering. As such, I think it doesn't really need to block on the RFC merging.</p>\n<p>We also went down a little bit of a rabbit hole with DFG helper method refactoring.

I kinda felt that it was nice to have it next to <code>DataFlowGraph::inst_result_types</code> since they have nearly identical structures. I don't feel super strongly about it though. I suspect there's some other way of factoring all this that would be even better but I haven't been able to figure out what that would be yet...</p>\n</blockquote>",
