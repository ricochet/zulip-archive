This is not a stable feature of Cargo and thus requires usage of nightly. Additionally one of the reasons it's not stable is that the DX is not great as many minimal-versions errors come from transitive dependencies that we can't do anything about. Nevertheless I figure it might be good to try out having it on CI and see how it fares.</p>\n<p>This is inspired by #6755 where we picked up a dependency on a newer version of <code>system-interface</code> but forgot to update the minimum version bound. Whether or not this prevents the issue or causes too many headaches is I think yet to be seen.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
