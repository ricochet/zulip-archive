We intend to merge this PR and ship it as patch release 9.0.3.</p>\n<p>In order to work with wasi-testsuite, it needs to be possible to<br>\npath_open(dirfd, \".\", ...) with the same rights reported in the<br>\nfdstat of that dirfd. When we report the Rights::all() set, both<br>\nFD_READ and FD_WRITE are set in the base rights, which results in<br>\nunix rejecting an openat2(dirfd, \".\", O_RDWR) with EISDIR.</p>\n<p>By not having the FD_READ and FD_WRITE rights present in the base<br>\nrights, the open syscall defaults to O_RDONLY, which is the only<br>\naccess mode allowed for opening directories.</p>\n<p>Note: wasi-testsuite is used to test our wasi-common implementation upstream, but not in this release branch, which is why this problem did not get caught before releasing 9.0.2.</p>\n</blockquote>",
