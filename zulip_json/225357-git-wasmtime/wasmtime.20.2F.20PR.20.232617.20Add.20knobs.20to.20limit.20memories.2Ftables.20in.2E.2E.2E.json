For example if N instances<br>\nare allowed and M tables are allowed per-instance, then currently<br>\nwasmtime allows MxN tables (which is quite a lot). This is causing some<br>\nwasm-smith-generated modules to exceed resource limits while fuzzing!</p>\n<p>This commits adds corresponding <code>max_tables</code> and <code>max_memories</code><br>\nfunctions to sit alongside the <code>max_instances</code> configuration.<br>\nAdditionally fuzzing now by default configures all of these to a<br>\nsomewhat low value to avoid too much resource usage while fuzzing.</p>\n</blockquote>",
