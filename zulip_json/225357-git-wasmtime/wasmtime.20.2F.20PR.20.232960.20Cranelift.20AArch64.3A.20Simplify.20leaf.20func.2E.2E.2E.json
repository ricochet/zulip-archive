I am not familiar with the ABIs of other architectures, so I don't know if it is safe to apply the same optimization, and that's why only the AArch64 backend does it.</p>\n<p>@cfallin I'd appreciate any feedback on how these changes interact with unwinding; in particular, do we need an <code>Inst::Unwind</code> pseudo-instruction for the simple leaf functions we are optimizing?</p>\n<p>cc @abrown @bnjbvr @uweigand</p>\n</blockquote>",

However, that made me realize that there were no unwind test for AArch64 (such as <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/inst/unwind/systemv.rs#L98\">these</a>), neither were the GC tests enabled, so now I am not sure that even my AArch64 implementation is complete. I'll make some testing changes in separate pull requests and then I'll come back to this.</p>\n</blockquote>",
