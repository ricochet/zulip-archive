If we take this as a goal, however, I don't think that we can solve problem (1) listed above because WIT itself doesn't retain a version number of when a symbol was first defined. Personally I don't think this matters too much in the sense that you would have to really go out of your way to create a component that imports 0.2.1 APIs at an 0.2.0 version and there's not necessarily a big consequence.</p>\n<p>Additionally with adding a symbol to each semver range, if we take the above goal as one to pursue, I'm not sure how we would do that. I'm not sure how we could enumerate all the semver versions that a symbol was known at.</p>\n<p>Otherwise though in terms of how the <code>Linker</code> type works you can think of it as a glorified component instance. You get to define exports and each export can itself be an instance with its own exports, so you end up with a tree-like structure where you defined all the names in the tree and the values at the leaves. So today <code>add_to_linker</code> is basically building the part of the tree with WASI names, for example. </p>\n<p>The semver compat stuff at this point is currently all built where for each component instance in the tree there's a table in that instance of \"if you're looking for something semver compatible with 0.2.X then go load import 0.2.3\" (or whatever the max registered version is). That's what gives rise to the behavior of if you import timezones at 0.2.0 then you'll get a \"hit\" on timezones at 0.2.1.</p>\n<p>I explain the <code>Linker</code> bits because one issue with the per-symbol versioning is that it's not quite the layer where versioning happens. At the component layer what's happening is that a component is importing a versioned instance from the host, but then in the instance there are no versions. For example <code>wasi:cli/environment@0.2.0</code> has a version but <code>get-environment</code> does not have a version. This means that there's really a concept of per-symbol versioning but instead you can think of a version as applying to an entire subtree (e.g. an instance). With that if a function were added to an interface then given the above scheme I think it gets a bit tricky.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Speaking again at a high level in terms of requirements, I think another requirement we'd like to have is to avoid the need to have lots of \"implement this one WASI proposal in terms of this other one\". For example in Wasmtime we don't want to manually implement all of 0.2.0 in terms of 0.2.1.</p>\n<p>Now in terms of trying to propose a solution instead of just critiquing them: the best I can think of is to maintain the last stable WASI release and the next draft we're supporting. This would then look like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> crate would only have generated bindings for the latest draft that Wasmtime supports, for example <code>0.2.1-draft</code> or whatever rc/date combo is currently being used.</li>\n<li>A new macro is added to generate an <code>add_to_linker</code> for the last stable release, e.g. 0.2.0.<ul>\n<li>This new macro only generates <code>add_to_linker</code>, no types.</li>\n<li>This new macro defines names at the 0.2.0 version but uses the 0.2.1 traits to implement the types. If the 0.2.0 traits are actually semver-compatible this'll compile just fine.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In the CLI by default we call the 0.2.0-based <code>add_to_linker</code>. If a CLI flag is passed then the 0.2.1-draft-based version would be called as well. (note that this is in addition to, not as a replacement of)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then as part of the ecosystem we'd have an optional feature perhaps on the <code>wasi</code> crate for enabling 0.2.1-draft (or maybe a prerelease of the crate itself? unsure.). That would generate bindings alongside the existing 0.2.0 ones perhaps in a submodule or similar (depends on the publication process of the crate itself I think). </p>\n</blockquote>",
