It wouldn't be too hard to add an invalid egraph rule that only matches when some flag is set, and only turn that flag on in a test, but I don't think it's worth doing that.</p>\n<p>Mostly I think we'll notice whether this is working whenever we write new incorrect egraph rules, which I'm sure will happen often enough. <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>\n</blockquote>",
