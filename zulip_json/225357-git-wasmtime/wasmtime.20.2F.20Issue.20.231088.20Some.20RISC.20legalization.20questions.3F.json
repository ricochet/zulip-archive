Specifically, <code>iconst</code> is lowered to one or several instructions depending on the value, so the backend can choose whatever synthesis strategy (constant pool, synthesizing from several parts, etc.) makes the most sense. Branches can be lowered to one or several instructions as necessary -- to the specific issue above regarding value widths supported by <code>brz</code>/<code>brnz</code>, we could add widening instructions as needed in the lowering.</p>\n</blockquote>",
