This PR required checking every call site for <code>translate_pattern</code> to see that a particular argument either used the same enum variant or was a recursive call that passed that argument through unchanged. Does Clippy do inter-procedural analyses like that?</p>\n<p>It helped that the method in question was not <code>pub</code> so it was easy to prove I'd checked all of its possible call sites. In general, I'd guess a Clippy lint for this couldn't fire all that often since any functions visible outside the crate would have to be exempt.</p>\n<p>At any rate, I think this is a question you should pose to the Clippy developers. We generally don't use Clippy in this project so I'm not all that familiar with it. But it's an interesting question and I do like to indulge in a good static analysis on occasion.</p>\n</blockquote>",
