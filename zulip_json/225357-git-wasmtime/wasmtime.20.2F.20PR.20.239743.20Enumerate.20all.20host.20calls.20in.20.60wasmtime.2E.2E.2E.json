Here the <code>Compiler::call_indirect_host</code> method is updated to take a new type, <code>HostCall</code>, which indicates what type of host call is being performed. This is then serialized to a 32-bit integer which will be present in the pulley instruction being generated. This 32-bit integer will then be used to perform a dispatch (the dispatch is left for a future PR with more Pulley integration).</p>\n<p>This new <code>HostCall</code> structure is defined with <code>BuiltinFunctionIndex</code> internally. Additionally a new <code>ComponentBuiltinFunctionIndex</code> is added to enumerate the same set of indexes for components as well. Along the way the split between component transcoders/builtins were removed and they're now all lumped together in one macro for builtins. (no need to have two separate macros).</p>\n<p>This new <code>HostCall</code> is used to implement the <code>call_indirect_host</code> instruction for Pulley to fill out an unimplemented piece of code.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
