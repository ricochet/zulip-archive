We treat the result as an unordered set of values, so setting rule priorities is meaningless. We want to prohibit relying on the rule match order in this case.</p>\n<p>Also, codegen can produce invalid Rust if rules with different priorities both match against a multi-term. We first documented this symptom in #5647. As far as I can figure, prohibiting rule priorities prevents all possible instances of that bug.</p>\n<p>At some point in the future we might decide we want to carefully define semantics for multi-term result ordering, at which point we can revisit this.</p>\n</blockquote>",
