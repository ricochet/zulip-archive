I'd take this PR even if you don't get around to that. So pick whichever is more convenient for you.</p>\n<p>When I look at the associated constant idea, I wonder: why do we export types like <code>TestCase</code> from the cranelift-fuzzgen crate?</p>\n<p>If we declared that struct in the cranelift-fuzzgen target instead, we just need to provide implementations of <code>Arbitrary</code> and <code>Debug</code> along with it. The current <code>Arbitrary</code> implementation is very short because it mostly delegates to the <code>FuzzGen</code> struct, and if we put that in the fuzz target then we have the opportunity to tweak the config there. The <code>FuzzGen::generate_host_test</code> method probably should get inlined in the implementation of <code>Arbitrary</code>. But the lower-level methods (<code>generate_flags</code>, <code>generate_func</code>, <code>generate_test_inputs</code>) are sensible things to share across multiple fuzz targets.</p>\n<p>I think the same plan works for <code>FunctionWithIsa</code> too. Its current <code>Arbitrary</code> implementation is more complicated but I think all the complexity is reasonable to move to the cranelift-icache fuzz target.</p>\n<p>I'd prefer if both <code>Debug</code> implementations call a shared helper from the fuzzgen crate too, for printing the target/flags/function body. Really, I want that even if we don't move these structs to the fuzz targets.</p>\n<p>Again, though, none of that needs to happen in _this_ PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",
