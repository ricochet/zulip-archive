Anyway, builds don't normally turn on Miette, so I'm hoping to merge this without getting Miette exactly right.</p>\n<p>Otherwise I think this is ready to merge so I'd appreciate review.</p>\n<p>By the way, the number of rules which currently can't fire due to higher-priority rules always matching first is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>25 in aarch64</li>\n<li>12 in x64</li>\n<li>4 in s390x</li>\n<li>0 in riscv64</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apparently there aren't any rules in any backends which attempt to constrain a binding site in two incompatible ways, like <code>(and 1 2)</code>, so that's reassuring.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The <code>Error::Errors</code> case, which contains a <code>Vec&lt;Error&gt;</code>, is handled in <code>error_miette.rs</code> by returning all the errors from <code>miette::Diagnostic::related</code>. I think Miette is then trying to report the source code for a span containing all of those errors at once. I think the panic I saw was when different errors came from different source files, so it couldn't cover them all in one span.</p>\n<p>Rather than fix any of that right now, I've just removed all my attempts to use Miette \"properly\" in this PR. Instead, the new errors are reported with basically the same simple text formatting whether Miette is enabled or not.</p>\n</blockquote>",
