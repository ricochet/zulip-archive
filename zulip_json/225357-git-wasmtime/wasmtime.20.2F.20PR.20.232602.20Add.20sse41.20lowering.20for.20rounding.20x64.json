The match here is already using two parameters, an opcode and type so I am missing what you mean here.

Now we've changed the code into <code>if use SSE4.1 { use SSE4.1 instructions for both scalars and vectors } else { VM calls }</code>. So non-SSE4.1 vector types aren't covered anymore.</p>\n<p>Note this is still an improvement compared to the previous situation where we <em>could</em> generate SSE4.1 code on non-SSE4.1 platforms.</p>\n<p>The right thing to do would be to implement something equivalent to the ROUND instructions, either as a VM call taking vector types as inputs, or as sequences of other SSE2 opcodes emulating the behavior. Or... we could say that wasm SIMD is only available for SSE4.1+ capable x86 machines :)</p>\n</blockquote>",
