My end goal is to eventually remove the <code>Dummy*</code> trait for wasm translation so we don't have to keep updating that over time, but for now these tests I think reside in a more appropriate location nowadays.</p>\n</blockquote>",

There was a report of exactly the same bug in Wasmtime two years later (#3509), and the fix included tests in <code>tests/misc_testsuite/empty.wast</code> to cover this case.</p>\n<p>The <code>empty.wast</code> test is better than this one because it has minimal and well-commented binary modules which I've verified still trigger the same bug if the fix is reverted. By contrast, since this older test was produced by a fuzzer, it is larger than necessary and the end of its name section is malformed and unparseable.</p>\n<p>Also, I had concluded that the reachability tests were pretty well covered by <code>tests/disas/*reach*.wat</code>, but your addition of <code>tests/disas/dead-code.wat</code> certainly can't hurt.</p>\n</blockquote>",
