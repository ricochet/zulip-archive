In that sense <code>iabs</code> with an <code>i64</code> result would match this rule but it's not valid to match this rule since it only works for vectors. I think that this would probably be best to have a matcher/extractor of some sort for the <code>ty</code> here like <code>multi_lane</code> (or ideally something like <code>multi_integer_lane</code> to avoid matching <code>f64x2</code> but I don't think we have that yet)</p>\n</blockquote>",

One can use rule priorities to make one rule semantically shadowed by others though; that's probably the easiest approach here. So <code>(rule -1 (lower (has_type ty ...)))</code> (lower numbers are lower priority).</p>\n</blockquote>",
