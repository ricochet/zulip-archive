The code that it still protects is not the \"meat\" of trap handling. Instead the <code>jmp_buf_if_trap</code> is changed to be more like \"take\" so once a \"take\" succeeds it won't be able to recursively call any more \"meat\".</p>\n<p>Overall this shouldn't affect anything, it's just a small internal cleanup.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
