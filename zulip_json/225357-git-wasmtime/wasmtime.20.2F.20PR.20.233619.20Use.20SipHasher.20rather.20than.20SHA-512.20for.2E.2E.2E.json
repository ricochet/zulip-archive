It turns out that <code>sha2</code> is a nontrivial dependency for<br>\nCranelift in many contexts, partly because it pulls in a number of other<br>\ncrates as well.</p>\n<p>One option is to remove the hash check under certain circumstances, as<br>\nimplemented in #3616. However, this is undesirable for other reasons:<br>\nhaving different dependency options in Wasmtime in particular for<br>\n<a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> vs. local builds is not really possible, and so either we<br>\nstill have the higher build cost in Wasmtime, or we turn off the checks<br>\nby default, which goes against the original intent of ensuring developer<br>\nsafety (no mysterious stale-source bugs).</p>\n<p>This PR uses <code>SipHash</code> instead, which is built into the standard<br>\nlibrary. <code>SipHash</code> is deprecated, but it's fixed and deterministic<br>\n(across runs and across Rust versions), which is what we need, unlike<br>\nthe suggested replacement <code>std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher</code>.<br>\nThe result is only 64 bits, and is not cryptographically secure, but we<br>\nnever needed that; we just need a simple check to indicate when we<br>\nforget a <code>rebuild-isle</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so. The list of<br>\n  suggested reviewers on the right can help you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please ensure all communication adheres to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">code of\nconduct</a>.<br>\n--&gt;<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
