With the addition of the <code>mutable</code> configuration option to <code>from_witx!</code> and <code>wasmtime_integration!</code>, one can disable this, emitting instead traits that use <code>&amp;self</code> (i.e., <code>mutable: false</code>). This change is helpful for implementing wasi-threads: WASI implementations with interior mutability will now be able to communitcate this to their Wiggle-generated code.</p>\n<p>The other side of this change is the <code>get_cx</code> closure passed to Wiggle's generated <code>add_to_linker</code> function. When <code>mutability</code> is set to <code>true</code> (default), the <code>get_cx</code> function takes a <code>&amp;mut</code> data structure from the store and returns a corresponding <code>&amp;mut</code> reference, usually to a field of the passed-in structure. When <code>mutability: false</code>, the <code>get_cx</code> closure will still take a <code>&amp;mut</code> data structure but now will return a <code>&amp;</code> reference.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
