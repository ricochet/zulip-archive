For now I'd like to see this as an added optional feature of the wasi-nn crate, that users can choose to use. It works as intended, but as I said its quite large and slimming it down will take some time. Suggestions, concerns, etc welcomed. </p>\n</blockquote>",

This should address some of the comments I made above. There is more refactoring that could/should be done in that area (fix the custom parsing, evaluate the use of <code>Arc</code>s) but hopefully that commit helps!</p>\n</blockquote>",
