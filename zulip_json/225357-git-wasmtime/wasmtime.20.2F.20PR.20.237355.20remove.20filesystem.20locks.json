This is in part because some additional<br>\ndesign work is required to integrate the blocking lock functions with<br>\npollable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These functions may come back as part of an additional filesystem<br>\ninterface in a post Preview 2 patch version 0.2.n, or in Preview 3 or<br>\nbeyond. Until then, their design is still in the git history.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
