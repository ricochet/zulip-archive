Additionally they would return SSE opcodes that must be used with <code>xmm_rm_r_imm</code>, but the result of <code>sse_cmp_op</code> is used directly with <code>xmm_rm_r</code> in the definition of <code>vector_all_ones</code>. If these cases were to suddenly become reachable through a heuristic change in ISLE, we would start seeing panics during code generation for lowerings that rely on <code>vector_of_ones</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

Additionally, <code>vector_all_ones</code> always called <code>sse_cmp_op</code> with the same type, so the other cases were redundant.</p>\n<p>The solution in this PR is to remove <code>sse_cmp_op</code> entirely and inline a call to <code>x64_pcmpeqd</code> directly in <code>vector_all_ones</code>, and remove the unused argument from <code>vector_all_ones</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
