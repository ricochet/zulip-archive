From what I could tell though <code>mremap</code> failed on memory regions where there were varying protections, which is what we do for our memory regions with guard pages and such. Consequently I don't think that we can use <code>mremap</code> on Linux, or at least not that I know of, unless I'm just being naive and there is actually a way to <code>mremap</code> a region with varying protections.</p>\n</blockquote>",
