There was one <code>debug_assert!</code> using the original tree for dominance queries, but we can do those in O(1) time against the preorder instead. So I've renamed <code>domtree_children</code> just to <code>domtree</code>, replacing the other <code>domtree</code> field entirely.</p>\n</blockquote>",
