This function was refactored in #3975 and accidentally introduced a bug where the future provided was polled once and then dropped, cancelling it instead of executing it to completion.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
