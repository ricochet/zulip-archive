Force enable the test at all times and then fix the test failures. The test failures here were introduced in #8277 and weren't caught due to the test not running and the fix was to relax the implementation of <code>fd_pread</code> to avoid taking multiple mutable borrows.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
