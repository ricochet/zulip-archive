One of the most onerous parts about releases right now is writing release notes in all the locations and making sure they're all up-to-date and in-sync. This is inevitably forgotten in some cases and various pieces will slip through the cracks. The basic idea of this PR is to change our release notes to only document the release branch that they're on. All historical release notes are relegated to historical branches.</p>\n<p>With this change there's no longer any need to backport or forward-port release notes for any changes. Instead release notes are written once on one branch and that's it.</p>\n<p>The major downside of this change is that there's no easy way to get a bird's eye view of all release notes for Wasmtime any more. If necessary that could theoretically be automated in the future (like <a href=\"https://releases.rs/\">https://releases.rs/</a>), but for now this feels like an acceptable compromise to make releases much easier.</p>\n<p>The contents of this PR are to update <code>RELEASES.md</code> with back-links to historical release notes as well as the various pieces of automation we have about managing release notes.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
