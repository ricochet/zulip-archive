In this particular case, the address-map construction<br>\nconsults the encoding info, which is not implemented by the new backend<br>\nand causes the panic.</p>\n<p>This fix simply avoids generating per-instruction entries in the address<br>\nmap; it at least gets us going until we plumb SourceLocs all the way<br>\nthrough the new pipeline.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
