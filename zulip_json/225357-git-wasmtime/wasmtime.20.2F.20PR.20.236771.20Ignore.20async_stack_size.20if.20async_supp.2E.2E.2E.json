I wasn't sure where to put it, let me know if there's a better spot for it (or some way to avoid the magic number of 8MB).</p>\n<p>Background: wasmtime-go is currently panicking when trying to set the stack size (see: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go/issues/182\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go/issues/182</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>",
