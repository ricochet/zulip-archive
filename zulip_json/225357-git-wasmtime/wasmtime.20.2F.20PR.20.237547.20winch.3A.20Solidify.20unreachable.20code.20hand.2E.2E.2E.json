Even though this appoach might seem natural at first, it actually broke several of the invariants that must be met at the end of each contol block, this was specially noticeable with programs that conditionally entered in an unreachable state, like for example</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"WebAssembly\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">module</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">func</span> <span class=\"cm\">(;0;)</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">param</span> <span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">result</span> <span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">local.get</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">local.get</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">result</span> <span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n      <span class=\"nb\">i32.const</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n      <span class=\"nb\">return</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span>\n      <span class=\"nb\">i32.const</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">end</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">i32.sub</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">export</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"main\"</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">func</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The approach followed in this commit ensures that all the invariants are met and introduces more guardrails around those invariants. In short, instead of resetting the value stack at unconditional jump sites, the value stack handling is deferred until the reachability analysis restores the reachability of the code generation process, ensuring that the value stack contains the exact amount of values expected by the frame where reachability is restored. Given that unconditional jumps reset the machine stack, when the reachability of the code generation process is restored, the SP offset is also restored which should match the size of the value stack.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
