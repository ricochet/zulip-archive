To make this a reality, a new API is required to notify the store that it's been moved over, so that it can initialize trap handling on this particular thread. I've made it an unsafe function, this should catch the eye of the users that they wouldn't need to use it in general. Also added a test that crashed before on a Mac.</p>\n</blockquote>",
