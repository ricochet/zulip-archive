That incoming handler will always return a 200, as it runs sanity checks on the state of the request as seen by an incoming handler.</p>\n<p>I think you'll want to add a new incoming handler like <a href=\"http://api-proxy.rs\">api-proxy.rs</a> that actually forwards the requests on, returning the result that it gets directly. Alternatively, you could add a new incoming handler that makes the request to <code>example.com</code> and returns that response, for any incoming request that it receives.</p>\n</blockquote>",
