This fixes a debug assert tripping in niche configurations of the pooling allocator where if no virtual memory is given and table lazy init is disabled then a module could trip a debug-only assert about a slice being created from a raw pointer that is not properly aligned. The fix here is to use a helper that starts with an over-aligned empty slice which is then casted down to a byte slice.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
