In an attempt to satisfy the dummy values of such imports the<br>\nfuzzing integration would create instances for each import. This would,<br>\nhowever, count towards instance limits and isn't always desired.</p>\n<p>This commit refactors the creation of dummy import values to decompose<br>\nimports of instances into imports of each individual item. This should<br>\nretain the pre-module-linking behavior of dummy imports for various<br>\nfuzzers.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
