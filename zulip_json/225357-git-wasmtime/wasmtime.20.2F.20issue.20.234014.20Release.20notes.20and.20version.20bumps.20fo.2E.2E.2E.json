If we need another point release on 0.35.0, we need to manually version-bump with <code>scripts/publish.rs</code> running <code>./publish bump-patch</code> and commit that, then add the <code>[automatically-tag-and-release-this-commit]</code> at the end of the commit, then make a PR against the stable branch and merge it once approved/green-CI. This semi-manual process is only needed to do a point release on 0.35.0; a point release on 0.36.0 or later will work fine with the workflow trigger as described in our published docs. Also, note that the \"security release\" checklist in that doc is different and has always been manual, because of CI limitations in the private fork.)</p>\n</blockquote>",
