I think making the condition <code>target_lexicon::OperatingSystem::Linux</code> would be fine-ish (I don't know what the *BSDs do with respect to this section; I see that <code>lld</code> ignores this section entirely and controls executable stack-ness with a command-line switch).  I don't think I'd want to try to condition on <code>*gnu</code>-ness; matching on <a href=\"https://docs.rs/target-lexicon/0.10.0/target_lexicon/enum.Environment.html\" title=\"https://docs.rs/target-lexicon/0.10.0/target_lexicon/enum.Environment.html\"><code>target_lexicon::Environment</code></a> to catch all of the cases would be annoying, I think -- and maybe you also have to catch musl-ness etc. as well?</p>\n<p>Making it ELF-only seems like the safest option, and the linker should just drop these sections anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>",
