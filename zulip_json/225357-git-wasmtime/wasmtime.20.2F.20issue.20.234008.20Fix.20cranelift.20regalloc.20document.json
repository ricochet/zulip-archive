Unfortunately this is actually an outdated document in another way: it describes the old Cranelift register allocator that no longer exists, and it appears we just forgot to delete it at the same time that we removed the code. If you want to convert this PR into a deletion of the file instead, though, I'd be happy to merge that.</p>\n</blockquote>",
