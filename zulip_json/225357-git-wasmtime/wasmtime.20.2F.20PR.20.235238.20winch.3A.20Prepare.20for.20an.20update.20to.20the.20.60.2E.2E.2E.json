This moves the function body and wasm validator out of the <code>CodeGen</code> structure and into parameters threaded into the emission of the actual function.</p>\n<p>Additionally the <code>VisitOperator</code> implementation was updated to remove the explicit calls to the validator, favoring instead a macro-generated solution to guarantee that all validation happens before any translation proceeds. This means that the <code>VisitOperator for CodeGen</code> impl is now infallible and the various methods have been inlined into the trait methods as well as removing the <code>Result&lt;_&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>Finally this commit updates translation to call <code>validator.finish(..)</code> which is required to perform the final validation steps of the function body.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
