I'm not sure what you expect from the review, since the PR is marked as a draft and you're not sure about it working; the approach of using a sequence of lowered instructions to emulate the addition looks good, if that's what you wanted to validate. An alternative is to extract each vector's lane, do the multiply, and reconstruct the result vector from this (iirc we do this in Spidermonkey; this seems alright since the vectors only have 2 lanes). Otherwise, I'd rather have a look once this has been tested, just to spare some back-and-forth, if that's alright with you :-) Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",

Sorry shouldn't have added folks as reviewers yet, did it to simply let you know the patch was coming where any feedback was a bonus .. so thanks. There are some redundant moves that I need to get rid of and check correctness which I'll get too soon. </p>\n</blockquote>",
