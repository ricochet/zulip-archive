Looking more into the fix #8113 I was looking to add some <code>*.wast</code> runtime tests to assert that the fix works at the wasm layer in addition to the instruction selection layer. I was poking around and there's a second user of <code>XmmCmove</code> which wasn't addressed in #8113.</p>\n<p>In #8113 the only caller of <code>cmove_xmm</code> was updated to ensure that everything was always in memory. This was done to both prevent the upgrade-to-an-aligned-load from loading too much but additionally to ensure that the load always happened, regardless of the condition. There was a second constructor of <code>XmmCmove</code>, however, from <code>cmove_or_xmm</code>. This is triggered when the condition is a <code>f64.ne</code> instruction, for example, and ran into the same bug that #8112 was exposing.</p>\n<p>To fix both of these and prevent any future issues about skipping a load by accident due to control flow this commit removes the <code>XmmMemAligned</code> argument entirely from <code>XmmCmove</code> and replaces it with <code>Xmm</code>. This prevents sinking loads entirely and sidesteps all these issues at the type level.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
