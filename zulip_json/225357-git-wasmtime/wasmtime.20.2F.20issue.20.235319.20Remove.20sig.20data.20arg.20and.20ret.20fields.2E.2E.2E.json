This is ensured by <code>from_func_sig</code>, which has a comment saying \"Handle retvals first, because we may need to add a return-area arg to the args.\"</p>\n<p>As a result,</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>self.args_start</code> == <code>self.rets_end</code>.</li>\n<li><code>self.rets_start</code> == <code>prev.args_end</code>, or 0 if there is no previous <code>SigData</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I believe that's the cause of the test failures. They were all off-by-one because the inputs that failed had exactly one return value.</p>\n<p>I think this means we could save some more space by keeping one <code>u16</code> length and one <code>u32</code> offset in each <code>SigData</code>, but I don't think we should try to do that until we've fixed this version using two <code>u32</code> offsets. Anyway, if I'm counting right, reducing a <code>u32</code> to a <code>u16</code> won't make the struct smaller right now because of padding and alignment, but it could help later combined with other changes.</p>\n<p>I'm not totally happy with how confusing this will be for anyone trying to maintain this code in the future, but I think it's worth doing if we add some comments. In particular, extend the comment at the beginning of <code>from_func_sig</code> to mention that the <code>args</code> and <code>rets</code> methods rely on the order in which they're added to <code>abi_args</code>; and add a comment to the <code>args</code> and <code>rets</code> methods saying to see <code>from_func_sig</code> for details.</p>\n</blockquote>",
