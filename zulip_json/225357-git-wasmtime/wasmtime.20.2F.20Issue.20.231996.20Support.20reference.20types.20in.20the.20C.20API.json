This way, <code>wasm_ref_copy</code> and <code>wasm_ref_delete</code> can still be safely implemented, which I think is valuable, even if a bunch of the other <code>wasm_ref_*</code> stuff is not worthwhile.</p>\n</blockquote>",

For <code>wasm_table_set</code> I think we should not take ownership anyway, so it's less of an issue there, but for <code>wasm_table_get</code> you'd need some way to delete the reference that you acquire. Without tagging we don't know, in isolation, what to delete there.</p>\n<p>Given that it seems that to support that API we'd need to have internal tagging. I'll raise an issue on the wasm-c-api repo as well.</p>\n</blockquote>",
