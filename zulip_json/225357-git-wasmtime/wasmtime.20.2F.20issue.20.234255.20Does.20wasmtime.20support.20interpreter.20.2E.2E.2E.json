This is something we would be open to having, if someone is interested in building it, but currently I'm not aware of anyone who is planning to do so.</p>\n<p>I'll go ahead and close this issue since the question is answered but again, we're happy to talk further if someone wants to build this!</p>\n</blockquote>",
