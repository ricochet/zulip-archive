Unlike <code>wiggle</code> however the configuration key is <code>async_except_imports: [\"...\"]</code> to provide a deny-list instead of an allow-list. This is done thinking that the majority of functions probably want to be <code>async</code> and it's easier to specify a list of synchronous imports instead of all the async ones. This key name also reflects how exports will be async no matter what, and it's just some imports which may be exempted.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
