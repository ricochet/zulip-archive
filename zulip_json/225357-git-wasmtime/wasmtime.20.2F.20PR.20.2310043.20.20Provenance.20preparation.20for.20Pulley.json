Currently today this is not possible because<br>\nPulley does not properly respect either strict or permissive provenance<br>\nmodels. The goal of this refactoring is to enable fixing this in a<br>\nfuture commit that doesn't touch everything in the codebase. Instead<br>\neverything is touched here in this commit.</p>\n<p>The basic problem with Pulley is that it is incompatible with the strict<br>\nprovenance model of Rust which means that we'll be using \"exposed<br>\nprovenance\" APIs to satisfy Rust's soundness requirements. In this model<br>\nwe must explicitly call <code>ptr.expose_provenance()</code> on any pointers<br>\nwhich are exposed to compiled code. Arguably we should also be already<br>\ndoing this for natively-compiled code but I am not certain about how<br>\nstrictly this is required.</p>\n<p>Currently in Wasmtime today we call <code>ptr.expose_provenance()</code> nowhere.<br>\nIt also turns out, though, that we share quite a few pointers in quite a<br>\nfew places with compiled code. This creates a bit of a problem! The<br>\nsolution settled on in this commit looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A new marker trait, <code>VmSafe</code>, is introduced. This trait is used to<br>\n  represent \"safe to share with compiled code\" types and enumerates some<br>\n  properties such as defined ABIs, primitives wrappers match primitive<br>\n  ABIs, and notably \"does not contain a pointer\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new type, <code>VmPtr&lt;T&gt;</code>, is added to represent pointers shared with<br>\n  compiled code. Internally for now this is just <code>SendSyncPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> but in<br>\n  the future it will be <code>usize</code>. By using <code>SendSyncPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> it shouldn't<br>\n  actually really change anything today other than requiring a lot of<br>\n  refactoring to get the types to line up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The core <code>vmctx_plus_offset*</code> methods are updated to require<br>\n<code>T: VmSafe</code>. Previously they allowed any <code>T</code> which is relatively<br>\n  dangerous to store any possible Rust type in Cranelift-accessible<br>\n  areas.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These three fundamental changes were introduced in this commit. All<br>\nfurther changes were refactoring necessary to get everything working<br>\nafter these changes. For example many types in <code>vmcontext.rs</code>, such as<br>\n<code>VMFuncRef</code>, have changed to using <code>VmPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> instead of <code>NonNull&lt;T&gt;</code> or<br>\n<code>*mut T</code>. This is a pretty expansive change which resulted in touching a<br>\nlot of places.</p>\n<p>One premise of <code>VmPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> is that it's non-null. This was an<br>\nadditional refactoring that updated a lot of places where previously<br>\n<code>*mut T</code> was used and now either <code>VmPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>NonNull&lt;T&gt;</code> is used.</p>\n<p>In the end the intention is that <code>VmPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> is used whenever pointers<br>\nare store in memory that can be accessed from Cranelift. When operating<br>\ninside of the runtime <code>NonNull&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>SendSyncPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> is preferred<br>\ninstead.</p>\n<p>As a final note, no provenance changes have actually happened yet. For<br>\nexample this doesn't fix Pulley in MIRI. What it does enable, though, is<br>\nthat the future commit to fix Pulley in MIRI will be much smaller with<br>\nthis having already landed.</p>\n</blockquote>",

As long as Rust supports linking to code that is not compiled by the same rustc invocation (i.e., does not adopt a fully closed-world assumption), its provenance model has to support the \"outside world\" escape hatch that calling JIT code would also fall into. And unless strict provenance is going to say \"you are no longer allowed to link C libraries, and all indirect calls have to be statically devirtualizable\" that's as far as an analysis is going to get.</p>\n</blockquote>",
