This is a consequence of (performance-motivated) bitpacking of <code>Operand</code>s into <code>u32</code>s in regalloc2.</p>\n<p>As a result of this, it is possible to produce a function body that will fail to compile by running out of vreg temporaries during lowering. Currently, this results in a panic. Ideally, we would propagate the error upward and return it programmatically.</p>\n<p>This PR does that, with a \"deferred error\" mechanism. A cleaner solution would be to properly thread the <code>Result</code> types through all layers of lowering. However, that would require supporting <code>Result</code>s in ISLE, and that is a deeper language-design and <code>islec</code>-hacking question that I think we can tackle later if we continue to see motivating cases.</p>\n<p>The deferral works by returning a valid but bogus <code>ValueReg</code>s to the lowering rule, but storing the error and checking for it in the toplevel lowering loop. (Note that we have to return a bogus <code>v0</code> rather than <code>VReg::invalid()</code>, because the latter causes the <code>ValueRegs</code> to think there is no register provided.)</p>\n<p>This PR also includes a test at the Wasmtime level. Note that it takes ~22s to run on my (relatively fast) laptop, because it has to run until it runs out of VRegs in a debug build of the compiler. We could remove the test if we feel we're otherwise confident.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Venkkatesh Sekar for reporting this issue! The integration test uses one of the example inputs from the report.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

There's a number of other <code>vregs.alloc(...).unwrap()</code> through the ABI code. Additionally there's preexisting error handling for <code>vregs.alloc(...)?</code> and could that use this same pattern as well? It might be relatively simplifying to assume that vreg allocation always succeeds and only at the end is the global error checked to see if allocation actually failed.</p>\n</blockquote>",
