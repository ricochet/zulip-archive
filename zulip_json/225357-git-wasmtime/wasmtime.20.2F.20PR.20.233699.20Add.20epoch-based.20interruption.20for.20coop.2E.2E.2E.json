The tradeoff is that this<br>\nmechanism interrupts with less precision: not at deterministic points<br>\nwhere fuel runs out, but rather when the Engine enters a new epoch. The<br>\ngenerated code instrumentation is substantially faster, however, because<br>\nit does not need to do as much work as when tracking fuel; it only loads<br>\nthe global \"epoch counter\" and does a compare-and-branch at backedges<br>\nand function prologues.</p>\n<p>This change has been measured as ~twice as fast as fuel-based<br>\ntimeslicing for some workloads, especially control-flow-intensive<br>\nworkloads such as the SpiderMonkey JS interpreter on Wasm/WASI.</p>\n<p>The intended interface is that the embedder of the <code>Engine</code> performs an<br>\n<code>engine.increment_epoch()</code> call periodically, e.g. once per millisecond.<br>\nAn async invocation of a Wasm guest on a <code>Store</code> can specify a number of<br>\nepoch-ticks that are allowed before an async yield back to the<br>\nexecutor's event loop. (The initial amount and automatic \"refills\" are<br>\nconfigured on the <code>Store</code>, just as for fuel.) This call does only<br>\nsignal-safe work (it increments an <code>AtomicU64</code>) so could be invoked from<br>\na periodic signal, or from a thread that wakes up once per period.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It seems to be in the noise at least on SpiderMonkey running a CPU-intensive workload (<code>fib()</code>) -- this tells me that the regalloc is doing the right thing and spilling where it needs to, so it's reasonable to use a <code>Variable</code> here as you suggest for slightly simpler/smaller IR, I think.
