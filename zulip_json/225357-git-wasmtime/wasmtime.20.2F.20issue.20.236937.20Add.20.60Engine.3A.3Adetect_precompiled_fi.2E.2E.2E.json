However, it sounds like both of you have reasons why that wasn't enough. I don't want to think about it that hard so I'll leave you to it.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If the expectation is that most applications will eventually move to the component model, I don't think it's worth codifying that sort of type in the crate API. But if you're feeling the pain while maintaining the CLI as well, it might be worth thinking more about some shared interfaces.</p>\n</blockquote>",
