Doing this properly required a lot of design work, including introducing the separation of mutable and immutable borrows into wiggle, but ultimately I think it was worthwhile. <code>cap-std</code> defines its own structs, flags, enums and so on, and in many ways these mirror the ones that <code>wiggle</code> can generate from the wasi witx files. In the <code>wasi-common</code> library we <code>impl From</code> to convert back and forth between these types, which is a little noisy, but we trust LLVM to compile these trivial impls down to no-ops, and worthwhile to break the complexity.</p>\n<p>Maybe we could spend some time pair programming this week to figure out how an analogous split would work for wasi-crypto?</p>\n</blockquote>",
