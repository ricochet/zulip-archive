The purpose of this change is to enable using LTO when building the C API. Currently LTO is disabled because one of the crate types of the C API is an \"rlib\" which means that it can't have LTO performed due to rustc limitations. The solution here is to remove the \"cdylib\" and \"staticlib\" crate types from the \"wasmtime-c-api\" crate and introduce a new crate 'wasmtime-c-api-artfact' which wraps the previous crate and reexports it.</p>\n<p>This way LTO can be enabled when just building the artifacts and the use case from #6765 is still satisfied by having a crate that can be linked to from Rust. Locally this reduces the size of the C API artifact for me by nearly 1M.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
