The pushes in wasmtime_fiber_switch start with <code>stp lr, fp, [sp, -16]!</code>, so FP was at CFA - 0x8, not CFA - 0x60. Unclear why it did work in the first place, and why it stopped working at some point; likely that something in Apple's libunwind has changed in the meanwhile.</li>\n<li>the OS page size is 16K, not 4K on Mac M1: a constant is used for the code section page's size, and defined per target, and reused in a few places in the code base. Thanks to @alexcrichton for indicating me the place to look at!</li>\n<li>unfortunately we need to disable pointer authentication (until we implement it!) for function frames that don't have a prologue too. Preferred to split <code>gen_prologue_frame_setup</code>, so there's a new function <code>gen_debug_frame_info</code> that's defaulting to doing nothing, and implemented on aarch64 and disabling pointer auth. This function is called independently from the fact that the function requires a prologue/epilogue, so we can put the unwind instruction that will generate the CFI directive in there. cc @cfallin @akirilov-arm for this change</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3256\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3256</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This is for example necessary for Rosetta 2 to work as it uses AArch64 sized pages. There may be other cases where it isn't possible to know this at compile time. You can use <code>region::page::size()</code> to query it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
