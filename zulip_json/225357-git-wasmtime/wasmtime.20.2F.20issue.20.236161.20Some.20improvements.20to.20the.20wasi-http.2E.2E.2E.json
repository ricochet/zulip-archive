We definitely should not have dependencies on a third-party service like this in our core CI flows, especially given that we will sometimes have time-sensitive CI builds (e.g. for security issues) that cannot tolerate third-party downtime.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We would still want some tests to connect on a \"real\" local network to make sure that code gets exercised as well.</p>\n</blockquote>",
