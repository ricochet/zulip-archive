Please fill out the TODOs below.</p>\n<h4>Feature</h4>\n<p>My team is using wasmtime for building a wasm-based VM. We need to set up different fuel cost for different opcode. It seems there is no such feature in current codebase. We really desire to see one.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>Finer fuel control enables more flexibility </p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>TODO: Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>\nalgorithms to use?</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>TODO: What are the alternative implementation approaches or alternative ways to<br>\nsolve the problem that this feature would solve? How do these alternatives<br>\ncompare to this proposal?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
