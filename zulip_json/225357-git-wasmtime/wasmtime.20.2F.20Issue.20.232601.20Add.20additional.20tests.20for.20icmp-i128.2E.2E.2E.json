IMHO we should flesh this out a bit more in the future and add run tests for everything that's required by CLIF semantics, but that's for a later time!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>failing checks are due to a security advisory</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'll go ahead and do a quick PR to bump the version, then we should be able to merge main into this branch to make cargo-deny happy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, for my edification: is the x64 backed the lowering framework, as opposed to the older legalizing one?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, exactly. We sometimes call it a <code>Machinst</code> backend or \"new-style backend\" and it's based on lowering to VCode.</p>\n</blockquote>",
