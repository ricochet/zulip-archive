This behavior though is not required by WebAssembly which validates that lane indices are always in-bounds. Additionally since these are static immediates even other code generators should be able to verify that the immediates are in-bounds.</p>\n<p>As a result this commit updates the definition of the <code>shuffle</code> instruction to specify that all byte immediates must be in-bounds in the range of [0, 32). The verifier has been updated and some test cases have been removed that were testing this functionality.</p>\n<p>Closes #5989</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
