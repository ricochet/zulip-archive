This helper expanded in some cases to a pseudo-<code>LoadAddr</code> instruction but the lowering of this instruction doesn't actually exhaustively handle all <code>AMode</code> values.</p>\n<p>The fix in this commit is to remove the <code>load_addr</code> helper altogether to remove the need to go from an <code>AMode</code> back to a <code>Reg</code>, instead going directly from an address to a register. The one small wrinkle is a small helper now to add the immediate offset to the address register, but that's not too too bad to write.</p>\n<p>By avoiding the <code>LoadAddr</code> instruction the unimplemented cases aren't hit, so the codegen issue should be fixed.</p>\n<p>Closes #6313</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
