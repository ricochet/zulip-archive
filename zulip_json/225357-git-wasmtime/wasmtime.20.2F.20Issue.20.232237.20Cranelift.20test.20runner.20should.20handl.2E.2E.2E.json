They should support larger boolean types, both scalar and vector.</p>\n<p>The underlying issue here is that Cranelift's <code>load</code> and <code>store</code> do not operate on boolean types so the trampoline must convert them from an equivalent integer type in memory to their boolean type before calling the compiled function (and vice-versa for the return).</p>\n</blockquote>",
