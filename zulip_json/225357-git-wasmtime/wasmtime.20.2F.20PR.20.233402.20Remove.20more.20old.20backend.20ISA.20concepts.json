In theory the two traits could be merged, which would be nice to limit the number of total concepts. Also they have quite different responsibilities, so it might be fine to keep them separate. Any thoughts @cfallin?</p>\n<p>Interestingly, this PR started as removing<code>RegInfo</code> from the <code>TargetIsa</code> trait since the adapter returned a dummy value there. From the fallout, noticed that all <code>Display</code> implementations didn't needed an ISA anymore (since these were only used to render ISA specific registers). Also the whole family of <code>RegInfo</code> / <code>ValueLoc</code> / <code>RegUnit</code> was exclusively used for the old backend, and these could be removed. Notably, some IR instructions needed to be removed, because they were using <code>RegUnit</code> too: this was the oddball of <code>regfill</code> / <code>regmove</code> / <code>regspill</code> / <code>copy_special</code>, which were IR instructions inserted by the old regalloc. Fare thee well!</p>\n</blockquote>",
