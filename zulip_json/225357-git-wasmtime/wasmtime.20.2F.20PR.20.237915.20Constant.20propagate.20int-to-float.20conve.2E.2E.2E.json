Today, on <code>main</code>, and in the 17.0.1 release Wasmtime will panic when compiling this wasm module for x64:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>(module\n  (func (result v128)\n    i32.const 0\n    i32x4.splat\n    f64x2.convert_low_i32x4_u))\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>panicking with:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>thread &#39;&lt;unnamed&gt;&#39; panicked at /home/alex/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/cranelift-codegen-0.104.1/src/machinst/lower.rs:766:21:\nshould be implemented in ISLE: inst = `v6 = fcvt_from_uint.f64x2 v13  ; v13 = const0`, type = `Some(types::F64X2)`\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Bisections points to the \"cause\" of this regression as #7859 which more-or-less means that this has always been an issue and that PR just happened to expose the issue. What's happening here is that egraph optimizations are turning the IR into a form that the x64 backend can't codegen. Namely there's no general purpose lowering of i64x2 being converted to f64x2. The Wasm frontend never produces this but the optimizations internally end up producing this.</p>\n<p>Notably here the result of this function is constant and what's happening is that a convert-of-a-splat is happening. In lieu of adding the full general lowering to x64 (which is perhaps overdue since this is the second or third time this panic has been triggered) I've opted to add constant propagation optimizations for int-to-float conversions. These are all based on the Rust <code>as</code> operator which has the same semantics as Cranelift. This is enough to fix the issue here for the time being.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
