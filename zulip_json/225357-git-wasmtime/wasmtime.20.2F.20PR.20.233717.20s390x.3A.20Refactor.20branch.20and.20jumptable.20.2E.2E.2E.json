Remove BranchTarget and simply<br>\nuse MachLabel everywhere a branch target is required.  (This brings the<br>\ns390x back-end in line with what x64 does as well.)</p>\n<p>In addition, simplify jumptable emission by moving all instructions<br>\nthat do not depend on the internal label (i.e. the conditional branch<br>\nto the default label, as well as the scaling the index register) out of<br>\nthe combined JTSequence instruction.</p>\n<p>This refactoring will make moving branch generation to ISLE easier.</p>\n<p>CC @cfallin </p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
