Previously this function required a <code>Store&lt;T&gt;</code> to be present to be able to perform type-checking on the contents of the linker, and now this requirement has been removed.</p>\n<p>Items stored within a linker are either a <code>HostFunc</code>, which has type information inside of it, or an <code>Extern</code>, which doesn't have type information inside of it. Due to the usage of <code>Extern</code> this is why a <code>Store</code> was required during the <code>InstancePre</code> construction process, it's used to extract the type of an <code>Extern</code>. This commit implements a solution where the type information of an <code>Extern</code> is stored alongside the <code>Extern</code> itself, meaning that the <code>InstancePre</code> construction process no longer requires a <code>Store&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>One caveat of this implementation is that some items, such as tables and memories, technically have a \"dynamic type\" where during type checking their current size is consulted to match against the minimum size required of an import. This no longer works when using <code>Linker::instantiate_pre</code> as the current size used is the one when it was inserted into the linker rather than the one available at instantiation time. It's hoped, however, that this is a relatively esoteric use case that doesn't impact many real-world users.</p>\n<p>Additionally note that this is an API-breaking change. Not only is the <code>Store</code> argument removed from <code>Linker::instantiate_pre</code>, but some other methods such as <code>Linker::define</code> grew a <code>Store</code> argument as the type needs to be extracted when an item is inserted into a linker.</p>\n<p>Closes #5675</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
