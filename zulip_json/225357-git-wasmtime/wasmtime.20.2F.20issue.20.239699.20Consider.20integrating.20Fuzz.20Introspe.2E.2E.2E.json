That's the very problem Fuzz Introspector was created to help address.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>Rust support was <a href=\"https://github.com/ossf/fuzz-introspector/pull/1818\">added to Fuzz Introspector</a> very recently, so it's not yet fully documented. I think that PR contains sufficient bread crumbs to find the right path to integration with our OSS-Fuzz setup, though.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>There might be alternative initiatives with similar goals that'd be more valuable to integrate. If so, I'm not aware of them.</p>\n</blockquote>",
