I have just been misusing <code>Linker</code> by assuming it was designed to give out an <code>Instance</code>, instead of to directly give out the exports with <code>get_one_by_name</code>.</p>\n<p>As such, let's repurpose this issue for documentation, to avoid that other people : maybe it should be made clear in the documentation that <code>Linker</code>s are there for when the user needs to link multiple modules together, and that often <code>instantiate()</code> should be replaced by <code>module()</code> and <code>get_one_by_name()</code>?</p>\n<p>Also… maybe it'd make sense to expose the same convenience getters on <code>Linker</code> as on <code>Instance</code>? The diff of my switch to using <code>Linker::module</code> instead of <code>Linker::instantiate</code> isn't that great :) <a href=\"https://github.com/Ekleog/kannader/commit/ee7de0461f62bb50420503ab7bef98b5e7149165\">https://github.com/Ekleog/kannader/commit/ee7de0461f62bb50420503ab7bef98b5e7149165</a></p>\n</blockquote>",

I agree, it would be good to clarify the docs in this area.</p>\n<p>If I read the diff correctly, the main convenience methods you'd want on <code>Linker</code> are <code>get_func</code> and <code>get_memory</code>, right? The <code>Linker</code> API does want to be careful about cases where there are multiple exports that match&mdash;hence the <code>get_one_*</code> naming. But offhand it does seem like accessors dedicated for querying functions etc. would be useful.</p>\n</blockquote>",
