In modern cores, the bit-test instructions are known to be slower than plain ALU operations. According to <a href=\"https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf\">Agner Fog's instruction tables</a>, on IceLake (a recent-ish Intel core) for example (pp. 350-351 in that PDF), AND/OR/XOR with reg/reg or reg/imm forms have a latency of 1 cycle and a throughput of 4/cycle, while BTS/BTR/BTC with reg/reg or reg/imm have a latency of 1 cycle and a throughput of 2/cycle. It gets worse for memory forms: the implementation is microcoded (11 uops; up to a few uops can be emitted by the hardware decoders, anything greater switches the frontend to microcode-sequencing mode with associated penalty).</p>\n<p>In general I think the tendency of modern compilers is to stick to the \"RISC-like\" areas of x86 because the more complex corners of the ISA are unoptimized; IMHO we should do the same as we'd prefer performance over saving a few bytes of code size.</p>\n</blockquote>",

However in that case it's necessary to make sure that <code>x</code> is used modulo <code>N</code>, where <code>N</code> is the number of bits in the result type. See the lowerings for <code>shl</code> for details, and note that the bit-test instructions use their operands modulo the operand width just like the x86 shift instructions do.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>Testing and modifying individual bits is a common pattern in certain kinds of systems programming, so such programs will produce smaller code and may run faster.</p>\n<p>These instructions don't modify their operands, unlike the and/or/xor instructions, so they're potentially eligible for load-sinking, and also register allocation may be able to avoid duplicating values. (edit: this is obviously only true for <code>bt</code>, not any of the other instructions which do modify their operands.)</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>This is mostly like adding any other instruction, but as a particular note, we have an extractor called <code>imm64_power_of_two</code> for getting the base-two log of an <code>iconst</code> if that constant is a power of two.</p>\n</blockquote>",
