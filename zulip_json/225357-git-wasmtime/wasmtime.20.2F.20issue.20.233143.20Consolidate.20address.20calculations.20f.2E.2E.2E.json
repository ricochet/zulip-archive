The trap showing up was different for emulation vs non-emulation (due to configurations around guard pages and linear memory). I'm not sure which trap <em>should</em> be showing up so I've modified the tests to only have one case of the trap possible, instead of two.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The codegen is inefficient in that it generates an <code>iadd</code> purely for the alignment check which probably overlaps with the later <code>iadd</code> for the the lowering of <code>heap_addr</code> or adding in the offset again, but this should at least be more correct than before and presumably optimizations can always come later too.</p>\n</blockquote>",
