This involves allocating a <code>Vec</code> and pushing a bunch (on AArch64, O(64)) of register-info structs onto it. We should share this work across the backend instance as long as it exists; and we can, because the flags (which might affect which registers we use) remain constant for one backend instance.</p>\n<p>This saves ~0.14% instruction count, ~0.18% allocated bytes, and ~1.5%<br>\nallocated blocks on a <code>clif-util wasm</code> compilation of <code>bz2.wasm</code> for<br>\naarch64.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
