Looking into this further in #7445, I discovered that it is due to how <code>has_cpuid_bit_set</code> works on different x86 machines: Intel's <code>CPUID</code> instruction reports support for MPK in a certain leaf bit, AMD does it some other (unknown?) way. The CI problem boiled down to occasional runs on AMD machines that would fail with <code>SIGILL</code> because the AMD machine reported that it had MPK support when it really did not. This change fixes the issue by first checking if the CPU vendor string is <code>GenuineIntel</code> before inspecting the MPK <code>CPUID</code> leaf bit.</p>\n<p>Closes #7445.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
