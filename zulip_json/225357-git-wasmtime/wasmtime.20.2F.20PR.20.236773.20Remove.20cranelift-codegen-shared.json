Reducing the time it takes to build Cranelift is super helpful. I was a little uncomfortable with adding more strings we have to emit from codegen-meta but the change is well-motivated and you've done a great job making the result as easy to maintain as possible. Thanks!</p>\n<p>I think one further change is necessary before we can merge this: don't we need to remove <code>cranelift-codegen-shared</code> from both lists in <code>scripts/publish.rs</code>? I think the <code>verify-publish</code> CI job would have caught this but it was skipped.</p>\n<p>Thanks also to @elliottt for reminding me that I hadn't responded to this PR yet.</p>\n</blockquote>",
