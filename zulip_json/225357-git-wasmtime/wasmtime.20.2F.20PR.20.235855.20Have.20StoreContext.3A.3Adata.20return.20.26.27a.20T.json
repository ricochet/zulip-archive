(was trying to make a <code>data_and_store(impl Into&lt;StoreContext&lt;'a, T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; (&amp;'a [u8], &amp;'a T)</code> convenience function in my project but it failed to compile for the aforementioned reason)</p>\n<p>Also added a <code>StoreContext: From&lt;StoreContextMut&gt;</code> impl, which would probably be useful for something in context/data/memory juggling even if I can't think of what specifically off the top of my head.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
