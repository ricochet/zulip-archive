If that's true, it should be somewhat easy to implement (add amount to SP, adjust the \"nominal SP\" offset, make sure to deallocate in the return paths).</p>\n<p>If one can pass a dynamic input value that's the amount to allocate, it is likely to be much trickier, because we need to be able to track precisely the running SP value within the function's body: that's what the nominal SP offset does in a static manner. It should be implementable, but it might require using a register for this purpose.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Using DWARF unwinding for perf profiles as opposed to frame pointers results in much bigger <code>perf.data</code> files and slower <code>perf report</code>, as it requires capturing a big chunk of the stack and then performing the unwinding offline.
