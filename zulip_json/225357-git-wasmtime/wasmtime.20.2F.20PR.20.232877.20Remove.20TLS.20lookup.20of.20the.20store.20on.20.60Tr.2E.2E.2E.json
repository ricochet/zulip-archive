This was previously done to lookup information in the<br>\nmodule registry, but nowadays there's a global registry which has all<br>\nthe equivalent information as well. This commit moves around some code<br>\nin the module registry and then uses this global map when creating<br>\ntraps.</p>\n<p>This is not motivated by performance, and likely regresses performance<br>\nslightly since it involves taking a global lock now. That being said the<br>\nperf of creating a <code>Trap</code> is generally not super consequential, so this<br>\nis seen as ok.</p>\n<p>The goal of this commit is to lessen Wasmtime's reliance on TLS for<br>\nstore-based information. I'm hoping to lessen this even more with the<br>\nchanges for <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/issues/11\">bytecodealliance/rfcs#11</a>, where acquiring a store via TLS is<br>\ngoing to be much more difficult if not possible any more.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
