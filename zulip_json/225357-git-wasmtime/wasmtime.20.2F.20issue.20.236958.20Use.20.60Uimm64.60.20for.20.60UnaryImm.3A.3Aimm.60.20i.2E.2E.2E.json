For example, since #6850, the immediate of <code>iconst.i32 -2</code> is encoded in <code>UnaryImm::imm</code> as <code>0xffff_fffe</code>, and not <code>-2</code>, despite being stored in a signed 64-bit integer.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>Change the type, listen to the complaints of the compiler, and address tests breakage.</p>\n<p>I would like to try to address this issue, if it's suitable for a compiler beginner with limited time resource.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Keep using <code>Imm64</code> since the verifier is already rejecting incorrect encodings.</p>\n</blockquote>",
