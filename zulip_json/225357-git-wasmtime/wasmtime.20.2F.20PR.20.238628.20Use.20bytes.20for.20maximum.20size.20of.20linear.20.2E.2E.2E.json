The previous <code>PoolingAllocatorConfig::memory_pages</code> configuration option configures the maximum size that a linear memory may grow to at runtime. This is an important factor in calculation of stripes for MPK and is also a coarse-grained knob apart from <code>StoreLimiter</code> to limit memory consumption. This configuration option has been renamed to <code>max_memory_size</code> and documented that it's in terms of bytes rather than pages as before.</p>\n<p>Additionally the documented constraint of <code>max_memory_size</code> must be smaller than <code>static_memory_bound</code> is now additionally enforced as a minor clean-up as part of this PR as well.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I'm basically just somewhat doubtful if it's worth the effort to try to document all tests for precisely what they're doing page-wise and such. I don't think any of the tests really need to be updated with custom-page-sizes since they're all using wasm memories of 64k pages and the tests for custom-page-sizes are going to be pretty orthogonal anyway. Much of the time the page limits are just to reduce VM memory reservations anyway and don't have much to do with page sizes.</p>\n</blockquote>",
