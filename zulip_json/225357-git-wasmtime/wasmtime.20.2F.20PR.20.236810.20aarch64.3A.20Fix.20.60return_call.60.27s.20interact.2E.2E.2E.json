The return address would be encrypted upon entry into the function but would never get restored later on.</p>\n<p>This addresses the issue by changing the encryption keys in use from the A/B key plus SP to instead using A/B plus the zero key. The reason for this is that during a normal function call before returning the SP value is guaranteed to be the same as it was upon entry. For tail calls though SP may be different due to differing numbers of stack arguments. This means that the modifier of SP can't be used for the tail convention.</p>\n<p>New <code>APIKey</code> definitions were added and that now additionally represents the A/B key plus the modifier. Non-<code>tail</code> calling conventions still use the same keys as before, it's just the <code>tail</code> convention that's different.</p>\n<p>Closes #6799</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
