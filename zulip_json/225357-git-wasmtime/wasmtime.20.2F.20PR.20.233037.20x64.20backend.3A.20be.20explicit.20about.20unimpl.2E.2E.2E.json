This fixes the issue by explicitly<br>\nlisting all opcodes the x64 backend does not yet implement.</p>\n<p>As per our tests, these opcodes are not used or need by Wasm lowering;<br>\nbut, it is good to know that they exist, so that we can eventually<br>\neither support or remove them.</p>\n<p>This was a good exercise for me as I wasn't aware of a few of these in<br>\nparticular: e.g., aarch64 supports <code>bmask</code> while x64 does not, and there<br>\nisn't a good reason why x64 shouldn't, especially if others hope to use<br>\nCranelift as a SIMD-capable general codegen in the future.</p>\n<p>The <code>unimplemented!()</code> cases are separate from <code>panic!()</code> ones: my<br>\nconvention here was to split out those that are logically just <em>missing</em><br>\nfrom those that should be <em>impossible</em>, mostly due to expected removal<br>\nby legalization before we reach the lowering step.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
