First I thought that this only needed a push/pop around calls to <code>cabi_realloc</code> in the component model, but that wasn't correct because that only works for import-based calls to <code>realloc</code>, not export-based calls. I then wrote a test to expose the flaw with that strategy.</p>\n<p>Next I thought that it would be possible to not actually maintain the entire linked list of activations and instead have a fiber have its own linked list which replaces the current thread's linked list when it resumes and swaps it back out when it suspends. This however does not work because a complete list of activations is required to correctly perform GC, so I wrote a test to expose that bug.</p>\n<p>Finally I settled on this solution, which is at least sufficient for all the above scenarios. I'm not 100% sure it's the end-all-be-all, so extra care in review would be appreciated!</p>\n</blockquote>",
