This is pretty common in wasm/compiled code where, for example, loop upper bounds are often constants. This helps compress code slightly while fusing more instructions together.</p>\n<p>The main cost of this is that the number of opcodes added here is quite large. Like with previous immediate-taking opcodes both 8 and 32-bit variants of immediates are added for all comparisons. Additionally unlike the previous set of branch-and-compare instructions it's required to add instructions for <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;=</code> because the operands cannot be swapped to invert the condition, further increasing the number of opcodes added.</p>\n<p>This is a mild size reduction on <code>spidermonkey.cwasm</code> from 29M to 28M but it's mostly expected to be a performance win for interpreted loops.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
