Changes made here are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Old <code>WASI-*</code> documentation is all removed. This has been outdated for quite some time and WASI docs are best documented at <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI</a> nowadays.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Language-specific documentation has all been removed. These docs have become pretty dated over the years and don't take into account many new developments in WASI or toolchains. This isn't the best place to document this anyway with <a href=\"https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/language-support.html\">excellent documentation existing elsewhere</a> so it's all removed from here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The CLI section of the book is now ordered just after the intro.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The \"Governance\" page under contributing is now removed as it's been \"More coming soon ...\" for a few years now.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Documentation under \"Stability\" and sub-pages has been updated. For example the release process is updated to reflect that branches are created on the 5th and published on the 20th.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Many WASI and WebAssembly proposals were moved to tier 1 as they're now stable proposals and fully supported in Wsamtime.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Winch is now explicitly listed as Tier 2 (wasn't mentioned before) for x86\\_64 and Tier 3 for aarch64.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The WebAssembly <code>gc</code> proposal is now listed as Tier 3.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some miscellaneous documentation in the \"platform support\" section was updated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",

I feel like examples are the most useful form of non-API documentation and I think it would be a shame to just remove all of these. Maybe just keep the Rust versions?</p>\n<p>The GCD examples, framed as GCD examples, don't really seem that useful but it is a simple example of the typed function API, which I think is valuable. Maybe we could reframe / retitle it or something?</p>\n<p>The memory example seems useful.</p>\n<p>The WASI example is dated. Definitely better places to go as far as toolchain docs go. But I think there is room for an example of how you call <code>add_to_linker</code> and all that with Wasmtime to <em>consume</em> WASI components (and probably also worth mentioning legazy preview1 stuff for a while, fwiw). We get a lot of issues filed by people not realizing they need to call <code>add_to_linker</code> and I think having an example to point people at would be good.</p>\n<p>The linking example is dated. Subsumed by component model stuff. But we might want to have an example of using the <code>Linker</code> and defining custom functions to be available for import.</p>\n<p>Language-specific debugging example seems redundant with the debugging section of the docs, although that section links to the Rust debugging bit. We should inline that into the debugging section (if you haven't already, haven't looked in detail at the rest of the changes yet).</p>\n<p>Same thing for the language-specific core dumps bit.</p>\n<p>The multi-value example seems like it is still generally useful.</p>\n</blockquote>",
