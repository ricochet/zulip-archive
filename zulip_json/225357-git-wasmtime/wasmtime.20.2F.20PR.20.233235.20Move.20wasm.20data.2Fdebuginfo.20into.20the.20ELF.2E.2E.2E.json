The goal<br>\nof this commit is to reduce the amount of data which <code>bincode</code> will need<br>\nto process in the future. DWARF debugging information and wasm data<br>\nsegments can be quite large, and they're relatively rarely read, so<br>\nthere's typically no need to copy them around. Instead by moving them<br>\ninto the ELF image this opens up the opportunity in the future to<br>\neliminate copies and use data directly as-found in the image itself.</p>\n<p>For information accessed possibly-multiple times, such as the wasm data<br>\nranges, the indexes of the data within the ELF image are computed when<br>\na <code>CompiledModule</code> is created. These indexes are then used to directly<br>\nindex into the image without having to root around in the ELF file each<br>\ntime they're accessed.</p>\n<p>One other change located here is that the symbolication context<br>\npreviously cloned the debug information into it to adhere to the<br>\n<code>'static</code> lifetime safely, but this isn't actually ever used in<br>\n<code>wasmtime</code> right now so the unsafety around this has been removed and<br>\ninstead borrowed data is returned (no more clones, yay!).</p>\n<p>cc #3230</p>\n</blockquote>",
