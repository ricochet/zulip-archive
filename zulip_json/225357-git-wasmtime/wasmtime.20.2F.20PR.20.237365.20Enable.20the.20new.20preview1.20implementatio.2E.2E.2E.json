The now-historical implementation lives in the <code>wasi-common</code> crate and the more recent implementation lives in the <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> crate. The main difference is that the <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> implementation is based on the implementation of preview2, meaning that the preview1 implementation is a shim in that direction. Additionally currently the preview2 implementation of preview1 is accessible via the <code>-Spreview2</code> flag on the CLI.</p>\n<p>This commit updates the interpretation of the <code>-Spreview2</code> flag and the defaults around which implementation to choose. By default the preview1-built-on-preview2 implementation (the new <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> implementation) is selected now. This means that the <code>wasi-common</code> implementation is disabled by default. There are still two use cases to keep running the <code>wasi-common</code> implementation, however:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When running modules that import from <code>wasi_unstable</code>, the \"snapshot\" before <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code>, currently <code>wasi-common</code> is required. The shims to implement <code>wasi_unstable</code> have not yet been implemented in the <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> crate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When running with WASI threads (<code>-Sthreads</code>) the preview2 implementation does not work. This is because the preview2 implementation expects mutable access to the table which is not granted when threads are enabled.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tests using <code>wasi_unstable</code> now pass <code>-Spreview2=n</code> to explicitly request the old <code>wasi-common</code> implementation. Additionally the <code>wasi-common</code> implementation is still selected by default when <code>-Sthreads</code> is passed (enabling the WASI threads proposal).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
