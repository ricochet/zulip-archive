For example if a host declares that a record has field <code>a</code> then field <code>b</code> it's currently incompatible with a component that says it has field <code>b</code> then field <code>a</code>, even if the types of the fields are the same. Threading through this type information could be the start of a basis for resolving this in the future where now all the type information is locally available to build these maps.</p>\n<p>Now that being said I don't think it's a good idea to do that at this time. The naive implementation would not be very fast and could run a risk of severly slowing down lifting/lowering even more, and it's not really required yet due to everything being generated from <code>*.wit</code> files which serve as a source of truth (including field order for example). Perhaps worth mentioning if anyone's curious though.</p>\n</blockquote>",
