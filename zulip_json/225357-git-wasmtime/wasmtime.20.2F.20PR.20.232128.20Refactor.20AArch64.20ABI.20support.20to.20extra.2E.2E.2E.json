This is an artifact of both a similar ABI<br>\n(both machines pass args and return values in registers first, then the<br>\nstack, and both machines give considerable freedom with stack-frame<br>\nlayout) and a too-low-level ABI abstraction in the existing design. For<br>\nmachines that fit the mainstream or most common ABI-design idioms, we<br>\nshould be able to do much better.</p>\n<p>This commit factors AArch64 into machine-specific and<br>\nmachine-independent parts, but does not yet modify x64; that will come<br>\nnext.</p>\n<p>This should be completely neutral with respect to compile time and<br>\ngenerated code performance.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
