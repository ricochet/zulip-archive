Thanks for opening an<br>\nissue! --&gt;</p>\n<h4>Feature</h4>\n<p>Value label ranges should be extended as far as the value is still available. This includes from the start of the prologue for arguments and up to the moment the register/spillslot is overwritten byva differenr value.<br>\n&lt;!-- What is the feature or code improvement you would like to do in<br>\nCranelift/Wasmtime? --&gt;</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>This would make variable debuginfo available in more cases.<br>\n&lt;!-- What is the value of adding this in Cranelift/Wasmtime? --&gt;</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>No idea<br>\n&lt;!-- Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>\nalgorithms to use? --&gt;</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Only implement <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2633\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2633</a>. This will solve most of the problem but variables would still not be available at as much locations as would be possible.<br>\n&lt;!-- Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they<br>\nbetter or worse than your proposal? --&gt;</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
