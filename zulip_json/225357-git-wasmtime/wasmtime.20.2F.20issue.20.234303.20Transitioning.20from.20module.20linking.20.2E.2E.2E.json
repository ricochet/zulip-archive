Here are my takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users of module linking should stick with pre-0.36 <code>wasmtime</code> for the time being.  Although it's technically possible to migrate to the component model already (i.e. <code>wasmtime</code> has enough of the building blocks to make module linking work), the rest of the ecosystem has not caught up and can't catch up until more foundation work is done, and trying to use it in this state would not be worth the trouble.</li>\n<li>There are a few specific opportunities to help with that foundation work now, and once that's done the ecosystem work will be very parallelizeable; i.e. many more opportunities will arise.  I've volunteered to help with this, and Alex and Nick are going to open issues to track a couple of the foundation work items.</li>\n<li>The long-term vision for linking modules will be component-oriented, e.g. <code>wasmtime_wasi::add_to_linker</code> would take a <code>component::Linker</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@alexcrichton perhaps you could clarify the last point, since I'm not sure I understood it.  Would there be two variants of <code>add_to_linker</code>, one for modules and one for components?  Or would both <code>Linker</code> types implement a trait so that <code>add_to_linker</code> could be generic?  Or would <code>component::Linker</code> simply replace the module <code>Linker</code> and subsume the latter's functionality such that instantiating a module is the same as instantiating a trivial component containing a single module?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

Much of the component model only makes sense in the context of the component model itself (e.g. async, resources, streams, etc) so I don't think it will be possible to have a full-featured generated for \"just\" core wasm. This means that in the long run support for running raw core wasm files will likely be dropped from <code>wit-bindgen</code> since it'll work primarily at the ocmponent layer.</p>\n</blockquote>",
