This moves a few maps that were temporarily allocated in an<br>\n<code>InstanceData</code> into the <code>VMComponentContext</code> and additionally reads the<br>\ncanonical options data from there instead.</p>\n<p>This type still won't be used in its \"full glory\" until the lowering of<br>\nhost functions is completely implemented, however, which will be coming<br>\nin a future commit.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
