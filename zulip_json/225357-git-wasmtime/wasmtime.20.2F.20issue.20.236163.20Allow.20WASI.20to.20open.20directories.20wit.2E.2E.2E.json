For directories opened for directories, they can just assume the same base and inheriting rights as the directory they were owned from, because the \"inheriting\" rights will apply to files opened <em>under</em> them.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

All I had to do to make the tests work on all platforms was to ensure that the file handle was closed before attempting to unlink the underlying file. So I don't strictly need to conditionally disable anything, unless you want it to specifically check the behavior of trying to unlink an open file. I guess you're saying we don't need to check that behavior on Windows, so are you asking for an explicit test that non-Windows systems do allow unlinking open files? I can do that, I just didn't see any sign that this was something these tests were intended to cover. It looked to me like it was more of an accident that they failed in this case.</p>\n</blockquote>",
