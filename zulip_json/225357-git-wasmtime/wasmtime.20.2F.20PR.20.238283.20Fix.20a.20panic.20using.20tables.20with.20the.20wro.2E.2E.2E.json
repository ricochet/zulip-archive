The panic happened due to an assertion that tables are being used with the right type of item and that was being mismatched. The underlying issue was that dropped element segments are modeled as an empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the \"functions\" encoding as opposed to the \"expressions\" encoding. This meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for externref-based tables.</p>\n<p>The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an \"expressions\" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to call the appropriate initializer.</p>\n<p>There is no memory safety issue with this mistake as the assertion was specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however, enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.</p>\n<p>Closes #8281</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
