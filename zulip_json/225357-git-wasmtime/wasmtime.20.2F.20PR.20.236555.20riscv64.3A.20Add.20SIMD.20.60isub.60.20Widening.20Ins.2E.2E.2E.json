These are similar to the instructions added in #6542. The only difference is that the rules are not commutative so we have slightly fewer of them.</p>\n<p>That PR explains how these instructions work in a slightly more detailed way. We have the exact same instructions for both <code>add</code> and <code>sub</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
