These were originally added to support multi-value in Wasmtime via the <code>TypedFunc</code> API, but they should now no longer be necessary. In general this is a higher-level Wasmtime concern than something all backends of Cranelift should have to deal with.</p>\n<p>Today with recent refactorings it's possible to remove the reliance on ABI details for multi-value and instead codify it directly into the Cranelift IR generated. For example wasm calls are able to have a \"purely internal\" ABI which Wasmtime's Rust code doesn't see at all, and the Rust code only interacts with the native ABI. The native ABI is redefined to be what the previous Wasmtime ABIs were, which is to return the first of a 2+ value return through a register (native return value) and everything else through a return pointer.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
