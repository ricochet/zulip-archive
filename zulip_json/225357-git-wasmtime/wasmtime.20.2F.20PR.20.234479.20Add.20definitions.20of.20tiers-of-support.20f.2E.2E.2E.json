This was somewhat<br>\npioneered in the [Wasmtime 1.0 RFC][rfc] but the documentation here is<br>\nexpanded to include more than just API stability but additionally other<br>\ncomponents. Inspiration for this is drawn from Rust's definition of<br>\n[support tiers][rust] as well.</p>\n<p>The motivation for this is to help clarify what exactly it means to live<br>\nat each tier and what is expected. For example one thing this document<br>\nclarifies is the requirements necessary for landing new major changes in<br>\nWasmtime at all. Additionally this helps clarify what it means to have<br>\nthe highest level of support vs \"otherwise well supported\".</p>\n<p>[rfc]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/wasmtime-one-dot-oh.md#tier-1---api-stable-production-quality\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/wasmtime-one-dot-oh.md#tier-1---api-stable-production-quality</a><br>\n[rust]: <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/target-tier-policy.html\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/target-tier-policy.html</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

WASI itself isn't really all that first-class by requiring an extra <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> crate which hasn't had much time put into its API design for stability too, though. I don't know how best to think about WASI proposals myself.</p>\n</blockquote>",
