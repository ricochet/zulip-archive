Is this an appropriate use of wasmtime?</p>\n<p>I have managed to build the simple hello.c example here...</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/examples/hello.c\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/examples/hello.c</a></p>\n<p>...with the prebuilt c-api release here...</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/download/v9.0.2/wasmtime-v9.0.2-x86_64-windows-c-api.zip\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/download/v9.0.2/wasmtime-v9.0.2-x86_64-windows-c-api.zip</a></p>\n<p>...but there appear to be symbols missing from the wasm.h file in the download - at the least, wasm_engine_delete and wasm_store_delete, although I suspect there are more. I can still build hello.c, but I think only because C is evil like that (?) and the functions <em>do</em> actually exist in the libs so the code is there, just no prototypes in the headers. </p>\n<p>Is this right? Technically 'it works' I guess, but I am very nervous to use wasmtime in this state as it feels like something isn't right.</p>\n<p>I have also grepped the c-api crate in this repository and both symbols are only found in comments in include/doc-wasm.h. This repository doesn't even have a wasm.h file, or maybe it's generated or something?</p>\n<p>Is c-api wasmtime pretty much over these days (or surely others would have encountered this) or am I just going crazy (always an option)?!?</p>\n<p>Bye,<br>\nMark</p>\n</blockquote>",
