On Unix <code>write</code> claims to always update the file position pointer to the end of the file, so this commit implements that instead of the previous logic of ignoring the position update for appending files. This currently requires an extra roundtrip via <code>stat</code> to figure out the size of the file, but for now that seems to be the best that can be done.</p>\n<p>Closes #7583</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
