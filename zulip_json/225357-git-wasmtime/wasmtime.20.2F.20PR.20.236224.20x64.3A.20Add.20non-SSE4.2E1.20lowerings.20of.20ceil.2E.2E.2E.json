To get these working <code>insertlane</code> for float vectors was also implemented for non-SSE4.1 instructions as well.</p>\n<p>Note that the goal of these lowerings is not speed but rather \"it works\", so the decompose-to-call-libcalls logic for vector is probably horrendously slow but should at least be correct.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

It is relatively verbose and may be ripe for some future refactoring (e.g. auto-encoding as AVX if the context's feature flags are set) but for now it's nice to not have to worry about AVX at all really as part of <code>lower.isle</code></p>\n</blockquote>",
