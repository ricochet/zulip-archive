Now, with the recent changes landed it is possible for us to return to the upstream!</p>\n<p>One of the changes we had in our fork is similar to the presented here. Namely, we noticed a performance increase for our workloads if we avoid allocations for a common case if the number of arguments doesn't exceed some threshold. </p>\n<p>In our fork it wasn't using <code>smallvec</code>, but I don't think it's worth the hassle avoiding it since <code>smallvec</code> is already used by cranelift. </p>\n</blockquote>",
