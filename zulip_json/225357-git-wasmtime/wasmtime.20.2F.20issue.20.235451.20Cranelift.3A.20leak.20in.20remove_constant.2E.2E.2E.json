We aren't sure now whether it's safe either to free the old value-list or to overwrite it in-place.</p>\n<p>In general, if there are multiple references to the same list, then any modification to that list based on the context of one of the references may lead to incorrect results for the other references. We had trouble with this in #3347 so last July I made cranelift-frontend copy, and potentially leak, jump-tables.</p>\n<p>I believe the egraph optimization pass is currently assuming that value-lists referenced from instructions are not shared. That could become a source of obscure bugs. Anywhere else that modifies any <code>EntityList</code> could be a problem too.</p>\n<p>I think we should collectively decide whether to allow multiple references to an <code>EntityList</code> in general across Cranelift.</p>\n<p>If we do allow this, then at the least we should prevent changing the length of such lists when there might be multiple references, because if the length changes enough then the list will be reallocated at a different offset in the pool, invalidating the other references. It might be wise to prohibit modifications to value-lists entirely in this case.</p>\n<p>But I think we should probably go the other direction, and decide that it's not okay to hold multiple references to the same <code>EntityList</code>. There are very few places which even could duplicate a reference: for example, <code>git grep '\\.[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_]*(' '*.rs'</code> is a fairly precise search for uses of instruction builders which might take an already-constructed value list, and there are very few matches. The only problem I see with this plan is that I'm not sure we can enforce it using Rust's type system, making it hard to tell if we get it wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>",
