That's why the latter<br>\ncrate re-exports the former.</p>\n<p>But we need to make sure to consistently use the re-exported version.<br>\nThat's most easily done if that's the only version we have available.<br>\nHowever, <code>fuzz/Cargo.toml</code> declared a direct dependency on <code>arbitrary</code>,<br>\nmaking it available for import, and leading to that version being used<br>\nin a couple places.</p>\n<p>There were two copies of <code>arbitrary</code> built before, even though they were<br>\nthe same version: one with the <code>derive</code> feature turned on, through the<br>\ndirect dependency, and one with it turned off when imported through<br>\n<code>libfuzzer-sys</code>. So I haven't specifically tested this but fuzzer builds<br>\nmight be slightly faster now.</p>\n<p>I have not removed the build-dep on <code>arbitrary</code>, because <code>build.rs</code> is<br>\nnot invoked by libFuzzer and so it doesn't matter what version of<br>\n<code>arbitrary</code> it uses.</p>\n<p>Our other crates, like <code>cranelift-fuzzgen</code> and <code>wasmtime-fuzzing</code>, can<br>\nstill accidentally use a different version of <code>arbitrary</code> than the fuzz<br>\ntargets which rely on them. This commit only fixes the direct cases<br>\nwithin <code>fuzz/**</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
