There were two major changes that happened in<br>\n<code>wasm-tools</code> in the meantime:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/697\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/697</a> - this commit introduced a new API for<br>\n  more efficiently reading binary operators from a wasm binary. The old<br>\n<code>Operator</code>-based reading was left in place, however, and continues to<br>\n  be what Wasmtime uses. I hope to update Wasmtime in a future PR to use<br>\n  this new API, but for now the biggest change is...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/703\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/703</a> - this commit was a major update to<br>\n  the component model AST. This commit almost entirely deals with the<br>\n  fallout of this change.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The changes made to the component model were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>unit</code> type no longer exists. This was generally a simple change<br>\n   where the <code>Unit</code> case in a few different locations were all removed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>expected</code> type was renamed to <code>result</code>. This similarly was<br>\n   relatively lightweight and mostly just a renaming on the surface. I<br>\n   took this opportunity to rename <code>val::Result</code> to <code>val::ResultVal</code> and<br>\n<code>types::Result</code> to <code>types::ResultType</code> to avoid clashing with the<br>\n   standard library types. The <code>Option</code>-based types were handled with<br>\n   this as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The payload type of <code>variant</code> and <code>result</code> types are now optional.<br>\n   This affected many locations that calculate flat type<br>\n   representations, ABI information, etc. The <code>#[derive(ComponentType)]</code><br>\n   macro now specifically handles Rust-defined <code>enum</code> types which have<br>\n   no payload to the equivalent in the component model.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Functions can now return multiple parameters. This changed the<br>\n   signature of invoking component functions because the return value is<br>\n   now bound by <code>ComponentNamedList</code> (renamed from <code>ComponentParams</code>).<br>\n   This had a large effect in the tests, fuzz test case generation, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Function types with 2-or-more parameters/results must uniquely name<br>\n   all parameters/results. This mostly affected the text format used<br>\n   throughout the tests.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I haven't added specifically new tests for multi-return but I changed a<br>\nnumber of tests to use it. Additionally I've updated the fuzzers to all<br>\nexercise multi-return as well so I think we should get some good<br>\ncoverage with that.</p>\n</blockquote>",
