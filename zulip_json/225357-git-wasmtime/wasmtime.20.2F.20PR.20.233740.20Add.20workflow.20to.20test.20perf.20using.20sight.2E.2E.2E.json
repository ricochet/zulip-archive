I do though the blast the sightglass directory and rebuild that. I don't blast the wasmtime directories but at some point during developing this it seemed those directories were removed but then very quickly rebuilt by the environment, implying to me that something was cached. </p>\n<p>This iteration doesn't actually test against much of anything (that will be critiqued for improvement), but as a result this entire process from start to finish only takes about 4-1/2 minutes, so even if everything is rebuilt it currently really doesn't take that long. Also like I mentioned above (and suggested offline), I want this to only run on demand not after every PR is submitted or updated. For this patch, I wanted to have something that was for sure going to work every time and then get fancy with the caching and other efficiency improvements on a future iteration. If there is something obvious to change now though, lets do it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
