The generation of the<br>\nhelper function happened recursively at compile time, however, and sure<br>\nenough oss-fuzz has found an input which blows the host stack at compile<br>\ntime.</p>\n<p>This commit removes the compile-time recursion from the adapter compiler<br>\nwhen translating these helper functions by deferring the translation to<br>\na worklist which is processed after the original function is translated.<br>\nThis makes the stack-based recursion instead heap-based, removing the<br>\nstack overflow.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
