The idea is executing WebAssembly modules in ring 0, allowing it to communicate via usual function calls, instead of system calls.<br>\nWebAssembly standard itself provides a \"guarantee\", that the given code will be safe to run in the kernel environment, therefore eliminating the need to execute it in \"user-space\".<br>\nHow hard will such an implementation will be in your more professional opinion?</p>\n<p>On of the projects implementing the idea: <a href=\"https://github.com/rianhunter/wasmjit\">WasmJit</a><br>\nThe results of using such a method look very promising, boasting execution times smaller than the execution times of native libraries themselves!</p>\n</blockquote>",
