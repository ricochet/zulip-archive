The fix<br>\nhere was mostly to just sink the enter/exit hook much lower in the code<br>\nto <code>invoke_wasm_and_catch_traps</code>, which is the common entry point for<br>\nall wasm calls.</p>\n<p>This did involve propagating the <code>StoreContext&lt;T&gt;</code> generic rather than<br>\nusing <code>StoreOpaque</code> unfortunately, but it is overally not too too much<br>\ncode and we generally wanted most of it inlined anyway.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
