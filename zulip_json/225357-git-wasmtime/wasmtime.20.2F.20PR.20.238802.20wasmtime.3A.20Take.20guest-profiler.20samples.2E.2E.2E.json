How do you think we should set the defaults for these features?</p>\n<p>I could imagine for example that <code>profiling</code> and <code>call-hook</code> would both be off-by-default in the <code>wasmtime</code> crate so that embedders don't take the performance hit unless they ask for it, but enabled by default in <code>wasmtime-cli</code> so that CLI users have the full profiler available.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the profiler's use of call-hooks could be made conditional on whether <code>call-hook</code> is enabled, but 1) I think that's going to be a bit ugly and 2) the new functionality makes the profiles quite a bit easier to interpret correctly so I kind of want it always available.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In principle I think an embedder could also use other means to pass the same information to the profiler if they wanted to.</p>\n<p>Hopefully that makes everyone happy?</p>\n</blockquote>",
