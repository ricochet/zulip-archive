Immediate rule application on the sub-nodes created from constructors means more than one ISLE invocation can be on the stack, in a reentrant way. My thought is to use a sort of workqueue to \"unstack\" it.);</li>\n<li>generalization of the several ad-hoc egraph analyses (loop depth, etc) into a framework.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The purpose of this draft PR is to be a place to do this work on a rebased and up-to-date basis. (Lots happened since the original egraph work branched off in May, including incremental compilation and a good number of smaller changes.)</p>\n<p>While patch-wrangling this week, I tried pulling this apart into smaller pieces, but the remaining bits are pretty cyclically entangled, and/or some of the intermediate points that might make sense (e.g. egraph build and elaboration without rule application) require re-synthesizing some scaffolding that would then disappear in the final state, so that seems a bit counterproductive. Once we have a polished state I can try pulling it apart into separate logical commits at least.</p>\n</blockquote>",
