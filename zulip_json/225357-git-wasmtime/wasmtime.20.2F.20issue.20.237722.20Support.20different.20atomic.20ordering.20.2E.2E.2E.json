I use atomic operations in a few places, currently using Acquire/Release and Relaxed (Monotonic in LLVM) for ordering (based on which one is needed). Some of these operations occur frequently, so I _really_ want to avoid the equivalent of <code>SeqCst</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Webassembly doesn't make them UB and for security reasons it wouldn't be possible to have data races be UB for Wasmtime's use case either. In fact by default no loads and stores are UB (unless they overwrite parts of the stack managed by Cranelift like the return address or values spilled to the stack by the register allocator). Even accessing unmapped memory isn't UB. You have to explicitly set the notrap flag to make that UB.</p>\n</blockquote>",
