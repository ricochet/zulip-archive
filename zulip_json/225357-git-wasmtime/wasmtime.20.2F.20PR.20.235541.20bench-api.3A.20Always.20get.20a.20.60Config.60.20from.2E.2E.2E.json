The root cause here appears to that when specifying <code>--engine-flags</code> the CLI parsing code is used to create a <code>Config</code> and when omitted a <code>Config::new</code> instance is created. The main difference between these is that for the CLI caching is enabled by default and for <code>Config::new</code> it is not. Coupled with the fact that caching doesn't really work for the <code>main</code> branch this ended up giving wild results.</p>\n<p>The fix here is to first always use the CLI parsing code to create a <code>Config</code> to ensure that a config is consistently created. Next the <code>--disable-cache</code> flag is unconditionally passed to the CLI parsing to ensure that compilation actually happens.</p>\n<p>Once applied this enables comparing an engine without flags and an engine with flags which provides consistent results.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
