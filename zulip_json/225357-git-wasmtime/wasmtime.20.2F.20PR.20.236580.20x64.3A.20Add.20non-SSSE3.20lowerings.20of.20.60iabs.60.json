Rules are match in-order highest-to-lowest priority and the first matching one is the one used for lowering. Rules then aren't allowed to overlap at all which is why a priority is required here because otherwise if <code>use_ssse3</code> is <code>true</code> then it's ambiguous which rule to use here (so the priority says check this one first)</p>\n</blockquote>",
