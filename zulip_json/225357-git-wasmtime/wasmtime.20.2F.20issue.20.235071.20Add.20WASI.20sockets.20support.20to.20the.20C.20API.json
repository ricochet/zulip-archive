With the implementation of sockets in C API, we will be able to add networking support to the wasmtime handler of <a href=\"https://github.com/containers/crun\">containers/crun</a> project. And further, we would be able to run wasm networking containers with usual <code>podman run -p port:port</code> command. In fact, I am stuck on this issue right now in my attempt to run ASP.NET in k8s via wasm runtime.</p>\n</blockquote>",
