But we'd prefer to avoid this. I can't see any reason this would be problematic for <code>wasmtime</code> and even if it becomes a problem, <code>wasmtime</code> probably wants to synchronize access to files itself and not offload this on to <code>WasiFile</code> implementors. So I think it is sane overall.</p>\n</blockquote>",
