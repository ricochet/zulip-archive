Inspired by <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8622#pullrequestreview-2083046911\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8622#pullrequestreview-2083046911</a> it defaults to including all the known configuration combinations and allows the macro user to opt-out where applicable. This makes the usage of the macro less verbose.</p>\n<p>The intention is to follow-up with subsequent PRs to migrate the all the applicable tests.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If that's the case it might be reasonable to have something like <code>features(gc)</code> for this macro. The macro would have built-in knowledge that Winch doesn't support <code>gc</code> but it would also additionally pre-configure the input <code>Config</code> to have <code>wasm_gc(true)</code> for example.</p>\n<p>That might make things easier to un-ignore for winch in the future as it would only involve changing one location for \"ok now winch supports gc\" as opposed to hunting down the various exceptions</p>\n</blockquote>",
