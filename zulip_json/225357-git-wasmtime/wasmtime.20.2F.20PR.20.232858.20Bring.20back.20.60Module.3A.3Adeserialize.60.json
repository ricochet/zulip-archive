As our studious fuzzers have found, though, this means<br>\nthat <code>Module::new</code> is not safe currently to pass arbitrary user-defined<br>\ninput into. Now one might pretty reasonable expect to be able to do<br>\nthat, however, being a WebAssembly engine and all. This PR as a result<br>\nseparates the <code>deserialize</code> part of <code>Module::new</code> back into<br>\n<code>Module::deserialize</code>.</p>\n<p>This means that binary blobs created with <code>Module::serialize</code> and<br>\n<code>Engine::precompile_module</code> will need to be passed to<br>\n<code>Module::deserialize</code> to \"rehydrate\" them back into a <code>Module</code>. This<br>\nrestores the property that it should be safe to pass arbitrary input to<br>\n<code>Module::new</code> since it's always expected to be a wasm module. This also<br>\nmeans that fuzzing will no longer attempt to fuzz <code>Module::deserialize</code><br>\nwhich isn't something we want to do anyway.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

Languages like Python expect everything to be safe, so this sort of documentation would inevitably end up there  as well. Or otherwise this would need to show up everywhere anyway (basically the <code>unsafe</code> in Rust doesn't help any users anywhere else).</p>\n<p>In the end I thought of this along the lines of <code>File::open</code> and <code>/dev/self/mem</code> (or whatever it's called).
