I think it's useful for building custom test environments that exercise things like C@E SDKs, where there may be a lot of imports that can't be statically shown to be unused but which aren't actually called dynamically. We don't currently plan to build such environments so this isn't a strong argument in favor of exposing this feature on the linker, but my guess is it would be useful to other people too.</p>\n</blockquote>",
