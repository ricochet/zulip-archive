I considered adding a short-circuit <code>if iovs.is_empty()</code> at the top of these functions but I don't really know if this is an error case (what error to return?). I dug a few layers to rustix but I decided to check with you all before implementing the <code>todo!()</code> lines in this PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",
