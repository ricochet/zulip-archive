Additionally when changing<br>\nregister allocation or similar it can cause a large number of changes in<br>\ntests but the tests themselves didn't actually break. For this reason<br>\nthis commit adds the ability to automatically update test expectations.</p>\n<p>The idea behind this commit is that tests of the form <code>test compile</code> can<br>\nalso optionally be flagged with the <code>precise-output</code> flag:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>test compile precise-output\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>and when doing so the compiled form of each function is asserted to 100%<br>\nmatch the following comments and their test expectations. If a match is<br>\nnot found then a <code>BLESS=1</code> environment variable can be used to<br>\nautomatically rewrite the test file itself with the correct assertion.<br>\nIf the environment variable isn't present and the expectation doesn't<br>\nmatch then the test fails.</p>\n<p>It's hoped that, if approved, a follow-up commit can add<br>\n<code>precise-output</code> to all current <code>test compile</code> tests (or make it the<br>\ndefault) and all tests can be mass-updated. When developing locally test<br>\nexpectations need not be written and instead tests can be run with<br>\n<code>BLESS=1</code> and the output can be manually verified. The environment<br>\nvariable will not be present on CI which means that changes to the<br>\noutput which don't also change the test expectation will cause CI to<br>\nfail. Furthermore this should still make updates to the test output<br>\neasily readable in review on CI because the test expectations are<br>\nintended to look the same as before.</p>\n<p>Closes #1539</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

(<code>BLESS</code> isn't out of the realm of possibility of some other tool also claiming...) Maybe <code>CRANELIFT_TEST_BLESS</code>?</p>\n</blockquote>",
