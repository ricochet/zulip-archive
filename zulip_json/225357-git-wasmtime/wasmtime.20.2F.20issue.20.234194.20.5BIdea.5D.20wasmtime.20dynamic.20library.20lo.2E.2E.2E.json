The issue description here is quite terse and doesn't convey details such as motivation, use cases, ecosystem interactions, etc. It's not 100% clear to me what you're shooting for so I'm assuming it's something akin to dynamic linking on native platforms where the general idea is that you can share a big was of code between programs by loading libraries at runtime. Designing such a feature for WebAssembly has large implications mostly on toolchains and how they work. For example while I believe Emscripten implements a form of dynamic linking I don't think it's been evaluated for off-the-web use yet.</p>\n<p>Overall this would probably be best discussed in a larger forum that's not just the Wasmtime repository because the Wasmtime-specific pieces of this are likely to be quite simple compared to the toolchain and ecosystem changes necessary. Unfortunately I don't know the best forum in which to discuss this.</p>\n</blockquote>",
