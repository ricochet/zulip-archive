Rather than make our users track a dependency on an additional crate, re-export it under the top-level <code>sync</code> module.</p>\n<p>This re-export sits behind the <code>sync</code> Cargo feature, which is enabled by default. Users who want to opt out of these re-exports can disable default-features.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> now re-exports the <code>cap_std::fs::Dir</code> type that it consumes in <code>WasiCtxBuilder::preopened_dir</code>. Again, just keeps the consumers of these crates from tracking another dep version.</p>\n<p>And finally I cleaned up those extra deps for the wasmtime cli.<br>\n&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
