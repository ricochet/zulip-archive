I did some benchmarking and we have 266664 unwind registers and the time per frame deregister is for me around 0.0843227 ms. Three runs:</p>\n<p>Deregister 266664 frames in 22485 ms (84.3227 microsec/frame)<br>\nDeregister 266664 frames in 22448 ms (84.1817 microsec/frame)<br>\nDeregister 266664 frames in 22232 ms (83.3742 microsec/frame)</p>\n<p>A fast deregister/register time is vital to us. Is there an easy solution here or a solution?</p>\n</blockquote>",
