Just depends on what that actually lowers to and the supported CPU feature. That encoding to 0x05 ( NLT_US) looks good except it signals. Not really sure what that means for cranelift .. maybe @cfallin @abrown you have comment. Perhaps instead we'd want to encode as 0x15 or NLT_UQ which does not signal.</p>\n</blockquote>",
