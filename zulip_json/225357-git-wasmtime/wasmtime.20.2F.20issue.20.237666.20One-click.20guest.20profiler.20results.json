They then browse to <a href=\"https://profiler.firefox.com/\">https://profiler.firefox.com/</a> and use their browser's file-open dialog to find the path we told them. It would be more convenient to give them a single URL which automatically loads the profile data.</p>\n<p>Running a local web server also allows us to symbolicate lazily and serve source code to the viewer on-demand, in principle.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>The Samply profiler illustrates how to do this, in <a href=\"https://github.com/mstange/samply/blob/main/samply/src/server.rs\">https://github.com/mstange/samply/blob/main/samply/src/server.rs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>We could continue just writing the profile to a file and letting the user find it in their filesystem.</p>\n<p>I was hesitant to suggest doing this in Wasmtime before because it means we need to depend on an HTTP server like <code>hyper</code>. I thought it would be better to implement the parts which depend on a web server in embedders such as Viceroy that have their own web server. But now that we've implemented wasi-http, Wasmtime depends on <code>hyper</code> anyway, so we might as well do it in Wasmtime where it can be shared across multiple embedders.</p>\n</blockquote>",
