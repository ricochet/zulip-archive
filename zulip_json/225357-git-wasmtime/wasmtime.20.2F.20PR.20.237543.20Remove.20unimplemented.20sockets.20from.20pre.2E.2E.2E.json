It's never been implemented but has the side effect of requiring TCP support to be imported into components even though it's never used. This commit removes the stubs in the adapter to get filled in at a later date if necessary.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
