In this case though the instruction encoding can be slightly more compact and remove a byte. This commit started off by applying this optimization, which resulted in the <code>*.clif</code> test changes in this commit.</p>\n<p>Further reading this code, however, I personally found it quite hard to follow what was happening with all the various branches and ModRM/SIB bits. I reviewed these encodings in the x64 architecture manual and attempted to improve the logic for encoding here. The new version in this commit is intended to be functionally equivalent to the prior version where dropping a zero-offset from the <code>ImmRegRegShift</code> variant is the only change.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
