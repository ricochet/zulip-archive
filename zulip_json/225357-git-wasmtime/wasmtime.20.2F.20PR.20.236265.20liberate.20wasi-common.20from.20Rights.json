It was a failed experiment, it has effectively no adoption, and its presence in the test suite is impeding the transition to Preview 2.</p>\n<p>All use of Rights throughout wasi-common is now removed, except for the <code>fs_rights_base</code> argument to <code>path_open</code> using <code>RIGHTS_FD_READ</code> to indicate <code>O_RDONLY</code> and <code>RIGHTS_FD_WRITE</code> to indicate <code>O_WRONLY</code>.</p>\n<p>All use of Rights is removed from the test suite, except for read/write. Portions of tests that check whether rights are available are deleted, only the read and write rights are ever passed, and the entire <code>path_open_read_without_rights</code> test is deleted, since its whole purpose was to measure that dropping rights worked.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
