Could we scope this down to an interaction that only happens as long as the <code>future-forwarded-result</code> is alive, and not try to return from execution until forwarding has complete, just waiting in a poll_list until the forwarding is complete? That will save on lots of back and forth interaction between host and guest, at least.</p>\n</blockquote>",
