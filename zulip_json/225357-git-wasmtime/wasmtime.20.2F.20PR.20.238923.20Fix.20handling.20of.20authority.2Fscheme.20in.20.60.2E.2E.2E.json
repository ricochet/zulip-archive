After discussion in #8878 the new logic implemented is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Creation of an incoming request now explicitly requires specifying a scheme which is out-of-band information about how the surrounding server received the request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The authority is stored separately within a request and is inferred from the URI's authority or the <code>Host</code> header if present. If neither are present then an error is returned.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Closes #8878</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
