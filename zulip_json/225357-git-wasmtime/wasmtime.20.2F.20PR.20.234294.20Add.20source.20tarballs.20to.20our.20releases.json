This goes further than requested by #3808 by<br>\nvendoring all Rust dependencies as well to be more in line with<br>\n\"download the source once then build somewhere without a network\".<br>\nVendoring the Rust dependencies makes the tarball pretty beefy (67M<br>\ncompressed, 500M uncompressed). Unfortunately most of this size comes<br>\nfrom vendored crates such as v8, pqcrypto-kyber, winapi, capstone-sys,<br>\nplotters, and web-sys. Only <code>winapi</code> in this list is actually needed for<br>\n<code>wasmtime</code>-the-binary and only on Windows as well but for now this is<br>\nthe state of things related to <code>cargo vendor</code>. If this becomes an issue<br>\nwe could specifically remove the bulky contents of crates in the<br>\n<code>vendor</code> directory such as <code>v8</code> since it's only used for fuzzing.</p>\n<p>Closes #3808</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

I mean, it won't copy top-level dotfiles, which is currently okay since the only things there are <code>.git*</code>, but it's a little weird. On the other hand, if <code>main.yml</code> someday gets changed to run this script later, then <code>cp *</code> will copy build products and the like.</p>\n<p>Constructing a clean copy with submodules is more of a pain than I'd like, so I think it's worth relying on the script running early enough that the working copy is pristine. Given that, I don't think you need to copy anything. You can ask GNU tar to archive <code>.</code>, but ignore <code>.git</code> and prepend <code>$pkgname</code> to every path, with these options: <code>--transform \"s/^\\./$pkgname/S\" --exclude-vcs</code></p>\n</blockquote>",
