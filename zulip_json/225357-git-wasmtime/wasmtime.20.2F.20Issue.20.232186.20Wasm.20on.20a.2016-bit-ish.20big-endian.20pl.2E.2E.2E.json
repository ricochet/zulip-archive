Fundamentally, the endianness is still visible in lots of different ways, e.g. in struct layout, and constant data included in the initial memory contents. The endianness is a deeply-baked-in assumption and I don't think one can predict all the breakage that might happen if you change the Wasm host's endianness without byte-swapping.</p>\n<p>That said, the right place for a discussion on \"should there be a big-endian Wasm\" is probably the Wasm spec community, rather than Cranelift/wasmtime; others on e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals</a> might have ideas or thoughts on this!</p>\n</blockquote>",

So for the endian-switch to work, you would need to ensure that memory stored as a larger integer is only ever accessed that way. I don't know if Rust-on-LLVM-to-Wasm guarantees that, and I'd be suspicious around e.g. enum tags, packed structs in general, widening or narrowing ops combined with loads or stores, etc. Basically, you would need to audit the whole compiler for such assumptions based on endianness.
