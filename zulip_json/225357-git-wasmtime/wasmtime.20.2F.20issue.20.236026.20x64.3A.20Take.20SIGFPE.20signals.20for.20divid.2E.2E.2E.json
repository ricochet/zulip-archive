Dealing with <code>Option</code> is a bit of a hassle in ISLE right now though and the only \"cost\" of this is a slightly larger trap metadata section which doesn't seem like it'll break the bank or cause any major issues in the meantime.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Is the issue mainly Valgrind warnings (and if so, is there a way to define a suppression for them)?

Those are done with guard pages and signal handling right now, so if those are working then I'd expecte SIGFPE to work as well. Or are you perhaps configuring wasm to have no signals by using dynamic memory with explicit bounds checks?</p>\n<p>(I'm also curious about what Chris mentioned in terms of suppressions and info about signals, too)</p>\n</blockquote>",
