The version chosen is 0.2.0 which reflects the upcoming \"preview 2\" release where in theory 0.1.0 was claimed by preview1. This is intended to stay as 0.2.0 for now and we'll determine how best to update these numbers in the future once preview2 is released.</p>\n<p>Closes #7171</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
