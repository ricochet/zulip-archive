This does the bare minimum necessary to configure C compilers such that we can produce binaries but I'll admit that I'm no Android developer myself so I have no idea if these are actually suitable for use anywhere. Otherwise though this build subsumes the preexisting check in CI that the build works for Android, so that part is removed too.</p>\n<p>This additionally changes how the NDK is managed from before. Previously a GitHub Action was used to download Java and the NDK and additionally used the <code>cargo ndk</code> subcommand. That's all removed now in favor of configuring C compilers directly with a pre-installed version of the NDK which should help reduce the CI dependencies a bit.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",

I've also updated the tier listing to explicitly say that this is tier 3, like riscv64.</p>\n<p>Part of my own motivation here is that I get the impression folks will glance at the release binaries and determine our platform support without digging much further, so this might help give the impression that Wasmtime isn't ONLY windows/mac/linux, perhaps. There's only so much we can do with that level of review from a prospective user though.</p>\n</blockquote>",
