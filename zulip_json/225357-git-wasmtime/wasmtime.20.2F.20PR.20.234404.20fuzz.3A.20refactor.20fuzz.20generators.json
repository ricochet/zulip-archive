In trying to<br>\npiece together what code does what, the size of the file and the light<br>\ndocumentation make it hard to discern what each part does. Since several<br>\ngenerator structures had been split out as separate modules in the<br>\n<code>generators/</code> directory, this change takes that refactoring further by<br>\nmoving the structures in <code>generators.rs</code> to their own modules. No logic<br>\nchanges were made, only the addition of documentation in a few places.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
