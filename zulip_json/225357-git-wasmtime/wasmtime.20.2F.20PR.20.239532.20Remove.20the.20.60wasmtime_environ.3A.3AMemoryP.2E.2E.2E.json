The goal of this commit is to eventually remove the abstraction layer of <code>MemoryPlan</code> and <code>MemoryStyle</code> in favor of directly reading the configuration of <code>Tunables</code>. The prediction is that it will be simpler to work directly with configured values instead of a layer of abstraction between the configuration and the runtime which needs to be evolved independently to capture how to interpret the configuration.</p>\n<p>Like with #9530 my plan is to eventually remove the <code>MemoryStyle</code> type itself, but that'll be a larger change, so it's deferred to a future PR.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
