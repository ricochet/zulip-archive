Previously, the module-level documentation for <code>pooling.rs</code> and <code>memory_pool.rs</code> had duplicated content which this change removes. It also takes a stab at clarifying \"how\" and \"why\" MPK is used for memory pooling.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
