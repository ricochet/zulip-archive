So it occurred to me to check what coverage the cranelift unit/integration tests already have.</p>\n<p>The line coverage reports suggest high coverage, but there are some gaps that might be worth discussion.</p>\n<h2>Coverage Generation</h2>\n<p>I found the <a href=\"https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov\"><code>taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov</code></a> tool to be very easy to use for coverage report generation.</p>\n<p>In the <code>cranelift</code> directory:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">cargo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">llvm</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">cov</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">disable</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">default</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">ignore</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">filename</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">regex</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">ignore</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">filename</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">regex</span><span class=\"o\">='</span><span class=\"na\">cargo</span><span class=\"o\">/'</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">html</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>By default the <code>llvm-cov</code> tool won't report coverage for the ISLE generated files. The <code>--disable-default-ignore-filename-regex</code> was necessary to disable this default behavior, and then <code>--ignore-filename-regex='cargo/'</code> ignores coverage from external dependencies.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>High-level coverage metrics for the ISLE generated files (columns are function/line/region):</p>\n<p>![Screen Shot 2023-11-15 at 8 00 46 PM](<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/assets/7133685/35a186da-045a-4847-9d16-cc8c2d04dbe3\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/assets/7133685/35a186da-045a-4847-9d16-cc8c2d04dbe3</a>)</p>\n<p>There's a lot of uncovered code to sift through, a lot of which is clearly not a concern (including uncovered <code>unreachable!</code> statements). But there seem to be some cases in here that might be worth looking into. For example, in <code>constructor_to_amode_add</code>:</p>\n<p>![Screen Shot 2023-11-15 at 8 02 50 PM](<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/assets/7133685/3111469c-fa32-4678-9b71-931ccd722bfd\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/assets/7133685/3111469c-fa32-4678-9b71-931ccd722bfd</a>)</p>\n<h2>Questions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are any of these coverage gaps interesting, and worth adding tests for?</li>\n<li>Are these gaps covered by fuzzing? (related #6293)</li>\n<li>Is 100% line coverage actually a reasonable goal here? What is the right metric? (related #1151)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>cc @jameysharp @fitzgen </p>\n</blockquote>",

That being said while it would be nice for at least one of those suites to cover everything it's probably not the most practical. I suspect the best place to add new tests would be the <code>filetest</code>-based test suite of Cranelift.</p>\n<p>IMO coverage of certain files is more important than others. For example I think the lowering rules are a great showcase of what should ideally be all covered. Runtime bits in Wasmtime I also think should all hopefully be covered via one way or another. I haven't ever found a good way to manage things like <code>unreachable!()</code> which discounts from looking like you're entirely covered but you're still practically covered.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If we do the former, we will also do the latter, but the latter is what is important IMO.</p>\n<p>I could imagine emitting some sort of probes/counters in the ISLE-generated code to track this kind of thing.</p>\n<p>Even better would be a test case generator that takes an ISLE lowering rule and creates a clif filetest and we could run that generator on each of our backends' complete rule sets, as you were musing about, to get 100% rule coverage. Big plus one to that idea from me!</p>\n</blockquote>",
