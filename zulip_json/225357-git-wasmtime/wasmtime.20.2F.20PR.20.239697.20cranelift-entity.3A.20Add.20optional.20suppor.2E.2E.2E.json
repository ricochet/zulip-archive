In particular here I'm somewhat concerned that this crate permits unsafe low-level casting and is claiming additional properties about our data structures; they may be true today, or may not (see comment), but we're also taking on additional burden reasoning about and upholding these properties going forward.</p>\n<p>For your particular use-case, would it be a possible alternative for you to wrap whatever types need these trait impls in your own types, and impl them locally? That way you could carry the maintenance task of ensuring the properties still hold, and of vetting dependencies, without adding those overheads here. Curious what you think.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Yes, not wanting to take on extra dependencies makes sense; I wasn't aware of the vetting policy.</p>\n<p>From my impression <code>bytemuck</code> is a fairly central ecosystem crate, seeing use in security-conscious projects like Servo and wgpu, and is also <a href=\"https://github.com/google/rust-crate-audits/blob/93e07327e17465f183d18a825639880f876227fc/manual-sources/google3-audits.toml#L270\">vetted for use in Google's projects</a>. And given <code>cranelift-entity</code>'s applications outside of Wasmtime, integrating with the broader ecosystem would make sense to me. But it's not a big deal to me one way or the other.</p>\n<p>As for your comment about guaranteeing a particular representation, the docs already do so implicitly, with <code>EntityList</code> being described as a single <code>u32</code> and <code>PackedOption&lt;T&gt;</code> being a trivial wrapper around <code>T</code>. So implementing these traits in <code>cranelift-entity</code> just allows downstream crates to take advantage of this layout without unsafe code that could silently break with a version bump.</p>\n<p>The reason I couldn't write a newtype around <code>cranelift-entity</code> types and implement <code>Pod</code> is because their layout is not currently guaranteed; the upstream types would need to be <code>repr(C)</code> or <code>repr(transparent)</code> (as changed in this PR) for that to be sound. I could change the PR to simply add these <code>repr</code> annotations and not the <code>bytemuck</code> dependency if you like. </p>\n</blockquote>",

Given all that, I think the deciding factor for me is the vetting overhead: we apparently don't pull in that Google vet (or it's not sufficient for our required level?) and I don't have cycles to go read all of <code>bytemuck</code> and convince myself of its correctness right now, so I think I'd prefer to see this be a minimal PR that adds the necessary <code>repr</code> directives to structs instead and documents invariants (zero-valued sentinels, etc) appropriately.
