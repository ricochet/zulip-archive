I haven’t looked over the code properly yet, however, one observation about removing <code>log</code> altogether is that this will probably force every user of <code>libwasmtime</code> to rely on <code>tracing</code> crate which i don’t think is a good idea. I think if I was a developer making use of the library, I’d rather have the choice or at the very least expect <code>log</code> support by default which seems to be the “industry” standard.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This allows the existing users who just want <code>log</code> in their system to use wasi-common just as they did before. Since the <code>tracing</code> dep isn't very heavy, this seems preferable than having a switch throughout wiggle codegen to emit one kind of log or another</li>\n<li>If we want to completely disable any code footprint from <code>tracing</code> or <code>log</code>, Wiggle can emit macros that point to <code>wiggle::tracing_impl::(macro)</code>, and use a feature flag in <code>wiggle/src/tracing_impl.rs</code> to substitute between <code>pub use tracing::*</code> and a module that defines no-op versions of each macro. This is suitable for use cases that are very sensitive about vendoring in additional deps, or where the code size of always-runtime-disabled macros is an issue.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
