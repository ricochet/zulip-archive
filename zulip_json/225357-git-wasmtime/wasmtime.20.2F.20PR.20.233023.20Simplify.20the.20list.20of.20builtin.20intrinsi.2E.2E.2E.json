It removes the<br>\nduplicated intrinsics for imported and locally defined items, instead<br>\nalways using one intrinsic for both. This was previously inconsistently<br>\napplied where some intrinsics got two copies (one for imported one for<br>\nlocal) and other intrinsics got only one copy. This does add an extra<br>\nbranch in intrinsics since they need to determine whether something is<br>\nlocal or not, but that's generally much lower cost than the intrinsics<br>\nthemselves.</p>\n<p>This also removes the <code>memory32_size</code> intrinsic, instead inlining the<br>\ncodegen directly into the clif IR. This matches what the <code>table.size</code><br>\ninstruction does and removes the need for a few functions on a<br>\n<code>wasmtime_runtime::Instance</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
