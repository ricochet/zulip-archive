Namely, I've delegated defining <code>OsDir</code> struct to OS-specific modules (BSD, Linux, Emscripten, Windows). This way, <code>OsDir</code> can safely re-use <code>OsHandle</code> for raw OS handle storage, and can store some aux data such as an initialized stream ptr in case of BSD. As a result, we can safely<br>\nget rid of <code>OsDirHandle</code> which IMHO was causing unnecessary noise and overcomplicating the design. On the other hand, delegating definition of <code>OsDir</code> to OS-specific modules isn't super clean in and of itself either. Perhaps there's a better way of handling this?</p>\n</blockquote>",
