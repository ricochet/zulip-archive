However, on some platforms it would be preferable<br>\nto just allocate enough space for any call done in the function<br>\nin the caller's prologue instead.</p>\n<p>This patch adds support to allow back-ends to choose that method.<br>\nInstead of calling emit_stack_pre/post_adjust around a call, they<br>\nsimply call a new accumulate_outgoing_args_size method of<br>\nABICaller instead.  This will pass on the required size to the<br>\nABICallee structure of the calling function, which will accumulate<br>\nthe maximum size required for all function calls.</p>\n<p>That accumulated size is then passed to the gen_clobber_save<br>\nand gen_clobber_restore functions so they can include the size<br>\nin the stack allocation / deallocation that already happens in<br>\nthe prologue / epilogue code.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
