All tests passed on AArch64 when I was working on my PR. They already passed on x86_64 (both Linux and macOS) @afonso360 said they found some regression on Windows, but that wasn't working great before Cranelift 0.88 anyway (or at all in case of MSVC, no idea if the regressions also affect MinGW. @afonso360?), so I don't mind having to wait another release personally.</p>\n</blockquote>",
