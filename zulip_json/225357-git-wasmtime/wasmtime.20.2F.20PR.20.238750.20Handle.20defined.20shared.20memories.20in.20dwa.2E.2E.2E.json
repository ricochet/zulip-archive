This is represented slightly differently in the <code>VMContext</code> than owned memories that aren't <code>shared</code>, and looks more like an imported memory. With support in #8740 it's now much easier to support this.</p>\n<p>Closes #8652</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
