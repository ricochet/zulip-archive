The current structure for PR tests will iterate over most matrix entries and filter them out based on whether they're applicable or not given the commit message and modified files. The thinking is that an early-return of <code>false</code> might be a false-negative where a later filter enables the test. By only early-returning <code>true</code> this enables any passing predicate to cause the tests to be run on a PR. Note that this has no effect on merge queues since those always and unconditionally run everything.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
