Does all of this sound reasonable? The most dubious is IMHO the last. However (i) if the unwinder claims to work by only reading the array of unwind ops, this shouldn't be a problem; and (ii) we need to make it so, because if there were clobber-saves, they would come <em>after</em> the stack limit check, and these are part of the prologue.</p>\n<p>I suppose a high-level alternative design branch would be to do the stack limit check outside of the prologue. However this requires a bunch of re-engineering, and divergence from the current shared ABI code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It implies two checks: \"enough stack limit to save clobbers\" before every call (this becomes the responsibility of the <em>caller</em>) and then the usual one, just after the prologue;</li>\n<li>When the host calls Wasm, it implies a stack limit check analogous to the above (as part of the trampoline maybe?);</li>\n<li>It implies that we decrement rsp twice, once to create space for clobber-saves and once to allocate the rest of the fixed frame (currently we collapse all this overhead into one <code>sub</code> instruction).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So that doesn't seem terribly tenable to me either.</p>\n<p>It's really unfortunate that I don't have a way of reproducing this locally, and that the unwinder is so opaque. I'm not sure what to do currently and have no remaining strategies for solving this bug other than \"ask Microsoft what changed in the Windows-2022 unwinder\"; does anyone else have better ideas?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

Does all of this sound reasonable? The most dubious is IMHO the last. However (i) if the unwinder claims to work by only reading the array of unwind ops, this shouldn't be a problem; and (ii) we need to make it so, because if there were clobber-saves, they would come <em>after</em> the stack limit check, and these are part of the prologue.</p>\n<p>I suppose a high-level alternative design branch would be to do the stack limit check outside of the prologue. However this requires a bunch of re-engineering, and divergence from the current shared ABI code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It implies two checks: \"enough stack limit to save clobbers\" before every call (this becomes the responsibility of the <em>caller</em>) and then the usual one, just after the prologue;</li>\n<li>When the host calls Wasm, it implies a stack limit check analogous to the above (as part of the trampoline maybe?);</li>\n<li>It implies that we decrement rsp twice, once to create space for clobber-saves and once to allocate the rest of the fixed frame (currently we collapse all this overhead into one <code>sub</code> instruction).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So that doesn't seem terribly tenable to me either.</p>\n<p>It's really unfortunate that I don't have a way of reproducing this locally, and that the unwinder is so opaque. I'm not sure what to do currently and have no remaining strategies for solving this bug other than \"ask Microsoft what changed in the Windows-2022 unwinder\"; does anyone else have better ideas?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

I double-checked everything down to the binary encoding and API alls we're calling into Windows. Everything checked out and made sense except for the fact that this doesn't work. It definitely feels odd that the exact same code works on 2019 and doesn't work on 2022. At this point I think we'd need to enlist a Windows expert to figure this out.</p>\n</blockquote>",
