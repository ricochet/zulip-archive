It ensures that the fuel checking code makes use of <code>Context::without</code> to retrieve the current fuel register.</p>\n<p>Even though no issues have been found, it is preferable to use <code>Context::without</code> in scenarios in which we have to introduce special out-of-band control flow and function calls to ensure that all the register allocation invariants are respected i.e., avoid holding onto to registers that: are not  in the stack and that might be needed for function calls.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
