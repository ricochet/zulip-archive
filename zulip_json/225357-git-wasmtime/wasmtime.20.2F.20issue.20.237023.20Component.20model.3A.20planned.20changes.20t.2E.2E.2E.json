If we one day stop reading the custom section that aligns well with, in my opinion, the intention of custom sections.</p>\n<p>So in that sense I feel we've got all the benefit today of using a custom section minus it being \"for real\", and using a more official solution is hopefully postpon-able into the future.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
