Previously in #7994 component imports were made semver-aware to ensure that bumping version numbers would not be a breaking change. This commit implements the same feature for component exports. This required some refactoring to move the definition of semver compat around and the previous refactoring in #8786 enables frontloading this work to happen before instantiation.</p>\n<p>Closes #8395</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
