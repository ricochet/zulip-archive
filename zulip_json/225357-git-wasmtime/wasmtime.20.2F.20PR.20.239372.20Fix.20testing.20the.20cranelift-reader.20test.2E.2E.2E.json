That PR uncovered the consequence that testing the <code>cranelift-reader</code> crate alone does not work on non-x86_64 platforms. One of its tests relies on parsing the <code>x86_64</code> target specification to work, and that only works if the <code>x86</code> feature of the cranelift-codegen crate is enabled. This PR unconditionally enables this feature when testing.</p>\n<p>This was uncovered on #9178 because the set of crates tested in each shard of our sharded builders depends on the set of crates in the workspace. When a new crate is added it may shuffle around which crates are tested in which location. Previously <code>cranelift-reader</code> must have been always tested with a crate that unconditionally enables <code>cranelift-codegen/x86</code> as a feature, but #9178 got unlucky where it moved to a set that didn't include this, thus exposing the failure.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
