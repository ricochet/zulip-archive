I've updated the dependency here and additionally vetted the various dependency upgrades. I notably did not vet <code>zstd-sys</code> since that would require vetting all of zstd's C implementation itself which I am not, nor do I suspect many of are, equipped to do. In lieu of that I've updated the exemption of <code>zstd-sys</code> to the newer version.</p>\n<p>Closes #7869</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
