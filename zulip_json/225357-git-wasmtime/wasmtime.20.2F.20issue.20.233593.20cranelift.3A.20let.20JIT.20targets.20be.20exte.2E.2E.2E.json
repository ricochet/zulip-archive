Otherwise, an externally-maintained machine backend would need frequent changes to continue working.</p>\n<p>In practice we tend to make changes to the backend framework together with all backends, when we need to do so, without much hesitation; for example, introducing a new trait method or tweaking a function signature. It would be a significant limitation to not be able to do such refactors easily.</p>\n<p>We'd be happy to accept contributions for new machine backends in-tree; RISC-V, for example, is of interest to a bunch of folks. If it were to exist, there would be significant willingness to maintain and improve it in-tree, I think. Likewise for x86-32: if someone wants to build this out, it would be perfectly reasonable to keep it in-tree.</p>\n<p>Translators to another IR, such as LLVM bitcode, are a bit of different matter IMHO as these generally do not operate within our compiler-backend framework (LLVM bitcode is at a similar abstraction level to CLIF and doesn't need CFG lowering or register allocation, for example). @bjorn3 prototyped a CLIF-to-LLVM translator in #3391 and we suggested then to maintain it out-of-tree for now. That' s an existence proof that such things are possible today :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",
