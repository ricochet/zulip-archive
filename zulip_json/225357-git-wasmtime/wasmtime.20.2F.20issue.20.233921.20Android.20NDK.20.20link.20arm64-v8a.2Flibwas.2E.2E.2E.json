If you're getting link errors then I'm not entirely sure how you got past the compiler errors and whether these are related. PRs for more platforms are fine to add support for so long as it isn't too much for us to maintain, otherwise if you'd like to see official support for Android that's also a discussion that can be had, but would probably be an RFC.</p>\n</blockquote>",
