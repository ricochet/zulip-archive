I don't think there was anything wrong with what we were doing before but it makes valgrind really unhappy. (See #7454)</p>\n<p>I've tested this with cg_clif on x86, and it now cleanly passes valgrind for the original reported testcase.</p>\n<p>Fixes: #7454<br>\nprtest:full</p>\n</blockquote>",

Or at least, we've seen elsewhere that it's better for first touch to be write when TLB contention is high...</p>\n</blockquote>",
