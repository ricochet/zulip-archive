This means that the new baseline required is SSSE3 for the WebAssembly SIMD proposal. Many existing tests for codegen were all updated to explicitly enable <code>has_sse41</code> and runtests were updated to test with and without SSE 4.1.</p>\n<p>Wasmtime's fuzzing is additionally updated to flip the SSE4.1 feature to enable fuzz-testing this.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Specifically the bug was that if there were two target-specific options the second one would be discarded because <code>parse_options</code> would only return one error for the first one it didn't recognize for the top-level flags. Now this unconditionally parses all flags which is, I believe, the intended behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>",
