For example, instead of passing <code>op.op_code()</code> and <code>op.funct_3()</code> separately, pass <code>op</code> and unpack it in the encoder. Or pass <code>rd</code> as a <code>WritableReg</code>, since the destination register had better always be a valid destination, and avoid using <code>to_reg()</code> at the call site.</p>\n<p>If all the arguments have more specialized types than <code>u32</code>, and those types ensure that they only hold values in the appropriate range for the corresponding field in the instruction encoding, then I'd prefer to remove the <code>&amp; 0b111…</code> masks everywhere. If any bits outside the mask are set, then that's a bug, and if none are set then the mask doesn't do anything, so the only effect of masking is to hide bugs.</p>\n<p>I'm also not fond of the masks being written out in binary because it's easy to mis-count how many ones there are.</p>\n<p>So if we think there might be bugs where high bits are set then I think I'd want something like <code>bits |= unsigned_field_width(opcode, 7);</code> with that function defined like this:</p>\n<p><div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">unsigned_field_width</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">value</span>: <span class=\"kt\">u32</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">width</span>: <span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"kt\">u32</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"fm\">debug_assert_eq!</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">value</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">!</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">width</span><span class=\"p\">),</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">value</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div><br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
