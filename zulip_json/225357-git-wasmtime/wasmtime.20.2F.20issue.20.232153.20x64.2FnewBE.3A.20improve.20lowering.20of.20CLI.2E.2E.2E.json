That includes an initial lowering of CLIF <code>AtomicRmw</code> into a multi-instruction sequence that is general, but inefficient in the case where the old value at the location is not required, which is probably a common occurrence.  In such cases we could do much better by producing a single LOCK-prefixed integer read-modify-write instruction, for example <code>lock xorq $27, (amode)</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
