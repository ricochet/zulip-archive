The simplest implementation lowers these instructions, <code>load[8|16|32|64]_lane</code> and <code>store[8|16|32|64]_lane</code>, to a sequence of either <code>load + insertlane</code> or <code>extractlane + store</code> (in CLIF). With the new backend's pattern matching, we expect these CLIF sequences to compile as a single machine instruction (at least in x64).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
