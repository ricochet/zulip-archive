In general, prior to every branch emission, a spill to memory is needed to avoid issues at the control flow merge.</p>\n<p>Note that we don't have many cases like this one in Winch's codebase (3 in total), however as a follow-up, it's probably worth considering introducing a stronger abstraction around branching to ensure that this case is handled whenever an arbitrary branch needs to be introduced. This change solely focuses on the fix and does not introduce any refactoring. I plan to follow-up with investigating a better branching strategy, since we would need to introduce a similar pattern for epoch handling.</p>\n<p>I used <code>wasm-tools shink</code> to shrink the original program, which I decided to add as part of an integration test.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I tried to shrink the original program using <code>wasm-tools shrink</code> and it was able to shrink it by 30%, if you think the test programs should be as small as possible I can definitely spend a bit more time trying to reduce it further. </p>\n</blockquote>",
