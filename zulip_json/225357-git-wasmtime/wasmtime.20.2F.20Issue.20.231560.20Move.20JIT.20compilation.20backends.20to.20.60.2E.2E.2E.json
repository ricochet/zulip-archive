So right now I imagine that if you're building an AOT backend then our current organization is probably not what you want. In theory you'd have to separate components, one for compilation and one for consumption of the compiled artifacts. The compiler would depend on cranelift at some point but the execution component would depend on <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> and doesn't want cranelift as a dependency. I'm hoping to refactor wasmtime internally to enable this use case.</p>\n<p>The general idea is that you should be able to statically split the wasmtime world where the runtime half doesn't depend on the compiler half. Currently the \"runtime half\" is the <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> crate which depends on <code>wasmtime-environ</code> (for shared data structures), but <code>wasmtime-environ</code> unconditionally depends on codegen backends, making it unsuitable for this purpose.</p>\n<p>I don't mean to conflate JIT/codegen/etc, and if you'd prefer I can extract all the codegen bits to something like a <code>wasmtime-codegen</code> crate or something like that.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The \"environ\" in the name is meant to relate to the <code>FuncEnvironment</code> and <code>ModuleEnvironment</code> trait implementations that it contains, so if those move to a different crate, <code>wasmtime-environ</code> could benefit from a new name.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Today though I think we still need to change something (<code>wasmtime-runtime</code> shouldn't transitively depend on cranelift/lightbeam). It sounds like you'd like to keep the code in <code>wasmtime-environ</code> separate from <code>wasmtime-jit</code>, so we'll need to split <code>wasmtime-environ</code>. The <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> crate would depend on the new crate that doesn't depend on cranelift. </p>\n<p>Does that sound right? Would you prefer that <code>wasmtime-environ</code> keep its name and a new crate is split out like <code>wasmtime-types</code> or <code>wasmtime-core</code> or something like that?</p>\n</blockquote>",
