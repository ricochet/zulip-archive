This ran into a couple of problems, so I'm wondering whether I'm on the right track here.  I'd appreciate your input ...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Frame size definition.    The <code>total_frame_size</code> value returned form <code>frame_size</code> is documented to equal the \"distance between FP and nominal SP\", and users (even outside of my new back-end) appear to rely on that fact, e.g. it is ultimately used to implement the <code>get_nominal_sp_to_fp</code> routine used in <code>spillslots_to_stack_map</code>.   However, with the new approach, the stack space used for clobbers (<code>clobber_size</code>) now lies between the nominal SP and the FP, so I believe this value now needs to be added to <code>total_frame_size</code>.     (At least in the non-baldrdash case.  I'm not really familiar with how baldrdash works, in particular in the new approach ...)</li>\n<li>Accumulate outgoing args.  We've added this feature a while back since I'm using it in my back-end.  This patch completely removed the feature again, breaking my back-end.  Would you accept a patch adding it back in the new approach?</li>\n<li>Operation without frame pointer.   I don't really need or want a frame pointer, but in the new approach I'm basically forced to define a FP register.   Would it be OK to add support for non-FP operation?   One option would be to make the FP register optional (like the LR currently is) and update the handling of <code>UnwindInst::PushFrameRegs</code> and <code>UnwindInst::DefineNewFrame</code> if no FP is present -- this is what I've implemented so far.  Another option would be to define a new <code>UnwindInst::AllocStack</code> that I could use instead of those two if there is no FP.</li>\n<li>Negative offsets to <code>UnwindInst::SaveReg</code>.    In particular in the absence of a FP (where I'm not using <code>DefineNewFrame</code>), the offsets to <code>SaveReg</code> are more naturally expressed relative to the incoming SP (or CFA).  But then they will be negative, which makes it a bit awkward to use the current interface which defines the offsets as <code>u32</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>",

Are you using <code>abi_impl.rs</code> or implementing the <code>ABICaller</code> / <code>ABICallee</code> traits directly?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm using <code>abi_impl.rs</code> just like x64 and aarch64 do.  I had thought that the problem with the get_nominal_sp_to_fp routine should also occur on those platforms, but at a second glance, it probably does not: the only user of this routine in common code is <br>\nspillslots_to_stack_map, but this uses the value only as an upper bound of the stack map size.  Given that there are no stack slots in the clobber area, for this particular use case the difference probably does not matter.</p>\n<p>On my platform, I have another use case in target-specific code.  This again has to do with the fact that I am not using a frame pointer register, and therefore the code generator has to rewrite accesses to the incoming argument slots (which are expressed by common code via offsets relative to the FP) in terms of offsets relative to the (nominal) SP.  This is done by simply adding the nominal_sp_to_fp offset, which used to work fine, but has now stopped working.</p>\n<p>So we can either fix the frame_size implementation so that nominal_sp_to_fp again returns the actual offset between those two points in the stack, or else I'll have to find some other way to pass the correct offset including clobbers to the back-end codegen (e.g. via a pseudo instruction).</p>\n<p>In case you agree with changing frame_size, here's a PR to do so: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2836\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2836</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Accumulate outgoing args</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sorry about this!

Without thinking through the implications a bit more, I don't have a strong opinion which of the two approaches you name makes more sense, but my initial thought is that perhaps we add <code>AllocStack</code> as you suggest and then omit <code>PushFrameRegs</code>. The SysV unwind info generator then just needs to track that it is in FP-less mode and continue to define the CFA in terms of SP instead.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Negative offsets to <code>UnwindInst::SaveReg</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To unify the view between the different platforms, I think it does make sense to continue to view the clobber locations in terms of a \"clobber frame\" that starts below them; I think that if we make <code>DefineNewFrame</code> work in an FP-less environment (but still have the same notion of an offset from some anchor to the start of clobbers) this should be possible? Or is there a fundamental conflict here?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's a PR to add support for operation without frame pointer along the lines suggested above: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2838\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2838</a></p>\n<p>In particular, this extends DefineNewFrame as you suggest for FP-less operation, and adds a new StackAlloc operation.  With those two, I can define the unwind information in my backend in a pretty straightforward manner.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
