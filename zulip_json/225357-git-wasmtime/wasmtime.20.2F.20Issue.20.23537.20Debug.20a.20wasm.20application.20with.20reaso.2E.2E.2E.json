Unfortunately right now I'm not in a position to reproduce those results for personal reasons. The numbers you mention seem like they would allow me to proceed with my original work on wasm-ing Yosys; I won't get around to that for a while, so I'm closing the issue, because it seems like you've pretty much solved it. I'll make sure to report my results once I get around to it.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Unfortunately, it seems that I hit a snag; on freshly compiled Yosys with WASI SDK 10, I get this if I pass <code>-g</code> after something like a minute of high CPU load:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>Error: failed to run main module `yosys.wasm`\n\nCaused by:\n    0: Debug information error\n    1: Hit the end of input before it was expected\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Here's the <a href=\"https://mega.nz/file/YoYVnQpQ#6ExaY_N6KMK_w7c9wF01Zg2gM_ap0qpJkF1nJpDFYuo\" title=\"https://mega.nz/file/YoYVnQpQ#6ExaY_N6KMK_w7c9wF01Zg2gM_ap0qpJkF1nJpDFYuo\">problematic wasm file</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I'd like to say that even if you never fix this, y'all are still totally awesome. That's because I don't need debug information anymore! Almost everything in Yosys (except for a bizarre <code>argv</code>-related bug I have no idea what to make of) that I tested so far not only works perfectly well, but also with amazingly low startup latency and incredible speed.</p>\n</blockquote>",
