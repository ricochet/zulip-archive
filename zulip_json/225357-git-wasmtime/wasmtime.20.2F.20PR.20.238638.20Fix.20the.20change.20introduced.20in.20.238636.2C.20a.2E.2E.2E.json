This PR fixes that misunderstanding, and renames the <code>sp_to_caller_sp_offset</code> function to <code>slot_base_to_caller_sp_offset</code> to make it really clear what the value being computed is used for.</p>\n<p>cc @jameysharp<br>\n&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
