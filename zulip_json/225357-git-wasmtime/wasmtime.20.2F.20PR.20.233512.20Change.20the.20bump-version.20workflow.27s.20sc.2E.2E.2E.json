It's<br>\nnot clear which. I think that<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3511\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3511</a> may have fallen<br>\nwithin our schedule but it was supposed to be on a weekday. Otherwise<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3499\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3499</a> was certainly<br>\nspurious. This commit moves to a simpler \"just do it on the same day<br>\neach month\" and we can manually figure out weekdays and such. Hopefully<br>\nthis should reduce the number of spurious PRs we're getting to bump<br>\nversions.</p>\n<p>This also removes the script to force a version bump since I found a<br>\nbutton on the GitHub UI to do the same thing. Additionally I've updated<br>\nthe patch-release documentation to use this button. Note that this<br>\nbutton takes inputs as well which means we can further automate patch<br>\nreleases to look even more like normal release process, differing only<br>\nin one part of the argument used to trigger the workflow.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
