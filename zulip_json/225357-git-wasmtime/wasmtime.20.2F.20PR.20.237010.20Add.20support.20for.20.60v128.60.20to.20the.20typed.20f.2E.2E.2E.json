This is intended to perhaps one day have accessors for lanes of various sizes but in the meantime only supports conversion back and forth between <code>u128</code>. The intention of this type is to allow platforms to perform typed between to functions that take or return <code>v128</code> wasm values.</p>\n<p>Previously this was not implemented because it's a bit tricky ABI-wise. Typed functions work by passing arguments in registers which requires the calling convention to match in both Cranelift and in Rust. This should be the case for supported platforms and the default calling convention, especially now that the wasm calling convention is separate from the platform calling convention. This does mean, however, that this feature can only be supported on x86_64 and AArch64. Currently neither s390x nor RISC-V have a means of supporting the vector calling convention since the vector types aren't available on stable in Rust itself. This means that it's now unfortunately possible to write a Wasmtime embedding that compiles on x86_64 that doesn't compile on s390x for example, but given how niche this feature is that seems like an ok tradeoff for now and by the time it's a problem Rust might have native stable support for vector types on these platforms.</p>\n<p>prtest:full</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
