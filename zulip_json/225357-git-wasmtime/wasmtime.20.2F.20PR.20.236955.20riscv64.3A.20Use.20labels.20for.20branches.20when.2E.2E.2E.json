IIRC I don't remember seeing lots of <code>has_f</code> checks, for example, in the <code>lower.isle</code> or <code>inst.isle</code> bits we have for RISC-V. I'm not sure whether that extension is itself relevant here, but this seems like a bug perhaps?</p>\n<p>For example if <code>has_f</code> is disabled then I'd expect the backend would either automatically pick other instructions or if it's a require extension then we'd generate an error during construction of the ISA saying \"required features are not enabled\". Otherwise I think today what might happen is that if <code>has_f</code> is disabled then we'd generate instructions from the <code>f</code> instruction set?</p>\n<p>(and again sorry I don't mean to pick on <code>f</code> here, I don't actually know what any of these extensions are, I just picked it randomly and this question applies to all of these enabled-by-default ones here)</p>\n</blockquote>",
