Here and in some other spots nearby I notice the pattern of specific cases followed by wildcards, which is fine for this as long as the more general fallback is correct without the special case, but here appears not to be.</p>\n<p>Earlier we had tried to follow the principle that rule ordering is <em>completely</em> flexible, and any applicable rule could fire, so the LHSes need to be disjoint or priorities need to be used if one must fire over the other. But I think that's pretty surprising and un-ergonomic in cases like this, so the DSL compiler now goes for \"more specific rule first\" which will indeed to the right thing here.</p>\n<p>We'll undoubtedly uncover other cases like this if/when we do try to verify in this way but I just thought I'd note it as a principle we're trying to stick to elsewhere; here a <code>(not_neg1)</code> extractor or somesuch might cause fewer issues later...</p>\n<p>(Part of me still likes the simplicity of \"first written rule takes priority\"; it's simple, explicit, no hidden magic... but others voiced good reasons not to do that, so, too late now probably...)</p>\n</blockquote>",

For the divide checks, this should be straightforward using some extra extractors as you say.   We still need a default case, but as long as the default is <code>true</code> instead of <code>false</code> it will still be always correct.  However, I guess I then cannot use the <code>(avoid_div_traps)</code> extractor as-is, since I need the negated sense now.  I don't think there's way to do that negation on ISLE, so I'd need another extractor e.g. like so:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">decl</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">zero_divisor_check_needed</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Value</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">bool</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">rule</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">zero_divisor_check_needed</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">u64_from_value</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">u64_nonzero</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"cp\">$false</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">rule</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">zero_divisor_check_needed</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">value_type</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">allow_div_traps</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"cp\">$false</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">rule</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">zero_divisor_check_needed</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"cp\">$true</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>That new <code>(allow_div_traps)</code> should probably go into the common prelude as well.</p>\n<p>However, I have made that same assumption extensively elsewhere, in particular when dispatching between different input types.  For example, there's frequently the pattern of a pair of  <code>(fits_in_32 ty)</code> and <code>(fits_in_64 ty)</code> rules, where 32-bit types <em>must</em> use the <code>fits_in_32</code> rule, since the input isn't sufficiently sign- or zero-extended so the instruction behind the <code>fits_in_64</code> rule would yield an incorrect result.   Similarly, for e.g. moves I have both a <code>(fits_in_32 ty)</code> rule and a <code>$F32</code> rule, where the <code>fits_in_32</code> rule is incorrect for <code>$F32</code> as it uses a GPR instruction.</p>\n<p>To ensure each rule is independently correct (if not optimal), I need to rework all this type handling.  This probably means making supported types for each rule much more explicit, which is probably a good thing in the long run anyway.</p>\n<p>I'll be working on this and provide an updated patch.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
