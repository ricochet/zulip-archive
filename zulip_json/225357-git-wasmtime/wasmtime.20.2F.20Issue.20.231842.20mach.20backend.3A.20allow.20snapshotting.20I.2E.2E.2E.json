I mean, given that setting SERIALIZE_REGALLOC causes code to be dumped in some publically visible location (/tmp). Fine if it's developer only and will never be possible in production builds. I just wanted to check that, if there are security issues, they have been considered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Definitely possible in production builds, but only oriented towards developers. I've made this a configurable path instead, as suggested before, and introduced a new feature flag for this. Thanks for the reviews!</p>\n</blockquote>",
