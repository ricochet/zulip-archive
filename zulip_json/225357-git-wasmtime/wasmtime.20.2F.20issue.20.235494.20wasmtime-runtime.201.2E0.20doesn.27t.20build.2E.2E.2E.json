However, according to <a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html\">Wasmtime's release process</a>, \"Security bugs and correctness fixes will be backported to the latest two releases of Wasmtime and issued as patch releases.\"</p>\n<p>The last two releases now are 4.0 and 3.0, so we no longer support 1.0. As a result, I'm closing this issue.</p>\n<p>If there's something we can fix that's keeping you from upgrading to a newer version of Wasmtime, please open an issue for that. We'd like to help!</p>\n</blockquote>",
