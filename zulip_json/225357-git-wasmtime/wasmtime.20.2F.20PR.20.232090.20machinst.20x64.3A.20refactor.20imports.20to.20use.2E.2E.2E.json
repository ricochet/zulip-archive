It removes newlines between the <code>use ...</code> statements in the x64 backend so that rustfmt can format them according to its convention. I noticed some files had followed a manual convention but subsequent additions did not seem to fit; this change fixes that and lightly coalesces some of the occurrences of <code>use a::b; use a::c;</code> into <code>use::{b, c}</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
