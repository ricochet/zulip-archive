Given that the high-level functionality exposed here is always going to be supported in Wasmtime in one way or another (e.g. via backtraces) I think it's ok to make this an \"official\" API with some brief docs. I don't think it's necessarily important to spend a ton of time figuring out the perfect API here either, as that's why we bump major versions still.</p>\n</blockquote>",

For example there's not really any need to create a duplicate <code>Vec&lt;FunctionLoc&gt;</code> when it already lives within <code>wasmtime::Module</code>. Additionally this structure may grow somewhat significantly over time to end up looking like a lot of interior pointers into <code>wasmtime::Module</code> and otherwise it may not need its own state. </p>\n<p>That being said though your future plans for this structure may motivate a separate type.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think we use this to avoid corresponding instructions to places they didn't come from but I sort of forget as well.</p>\n<p>Also IIRC I think that the map here is based here on ranges where if you get <code>(1, Some(2))</code> then <code>(5, Some(4))</code> then that means bytes 1, 2, 3, and 4 come from source position 2 and bytes 5 to the next range come from source position 4. Basically we're not going to have an entry per instruction but rather for ranges of instructions (which is what the <code>None</code> is used for, to terminate a range).</p>\n<p>Finally the first element of the pair returned here might be good to change to a <code>usize</code> to assist with indexing into <code>.text()</code>?</p>\n<p>Oh and one more, for the docs, I think it would be good to mention that the address map is not guaranteed to be available as there's a <code>Config</code> option which can disable it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
