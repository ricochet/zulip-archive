The logic to auto-gc before the return values go to wasm asserted that a synchronous GC was possible but the context this function is called in could be either async or sync. The fix applied in this commit is to remove the auto-gc. This means that hosts will need to explicitly GC in these situations until auto-gc is re-added back to Wasmtime.</p>\n<p>cc #8433 as this will make the behavior consistent, but we'll want to re-add the gc behavior.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
