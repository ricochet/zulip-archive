That to me seems possible indicative of future changes being required to <code>wasi:sockets</code> which wouldn't require such coupling, but we can't do that now so that's less the issue.</p>\n<p>In this situation though, if I'm understanding this right, the only reason for this split is so an active write isn't blocked out by accident when the tcp socket is shut down without going through the writer stream, right? If that's the case do you think it would be worthwhile to change the current storage of <code>Arc&lt;TcpStream&gt;</code> to just that plus a <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;SomeWriterState&gt;&gt;</code>? That way it's clear that there's only one shared piece of state and it's just the internals of the writer.</p>\n<p>My hope is that it would be more obvious that the intention is to not hand out multiple readers/writers via the <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code> and also minimize the scope/breadth of the mutex in question.</p>\n<p>If you think the refactoring isn't worth it though then I think this is ok as-is.</p>\n</blockquote>",
