I fear that people could interpret this as a signal for more stability than we can actually guarantee right now.</p>\n<p>The situation seems somewhat analogous to that in Node.js, where experimental JS features or Node APIs also need to be enabled explicitly, instead of just being available to content. To wit, Node has a <code>--experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1</code> flag  <span aria-label=\"big smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"big smile\">:big_smile:</span> </p>\n<p>For now, I'd prefer introducing a runtime flag instead of just making wasi-nn available unconditionally. Ideally not in the form of a one-off <code>--enable-wasi-nn</code>, but something like <code>--experimental-wasi-modules=wasi-nn,[..]</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
