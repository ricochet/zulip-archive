Previously to use <code>uffd</code> users needed to do a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable the pooling allocator</li>\n<li>Enable paged memory initialization</li>\n<li>Enable the <code>uffd</code> feature at compile time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any one of these were omitted, however, then <code>uffd</code> was silently not<br>\nused or otherwise wasn't beneficial (e.g. forgetting paged memory<br>\ninitialization means that memories would be all initialized<br>\nimmediately).</p>\n<p>This commit changes this configuration to instead have consumers<br>\nexplicitly request <code>uffd</code> as part of enabling the pooling allocation<br>\nstrategy. This makes it clear that <code>uffd</code> is only enabled for the<br>\npooling allocator, and requests to enable it when the feature isn't<br>\ncompiled in (or is the wrong platform) can return an error indicating<br>\nwhat happened.</p>\n<p>This does sort of effectively revert #3245 which allows enabling paged<br>\nmemory initialization independent of uffd, but at this time I can't<br>\nquite remember what the motivation was for that PR so I'm hoping that<br>\nthis can jog a memory!</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so. The list of<br>\n  suggested reviewers on the right can help you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please ensure all communication adheres to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">code of\nconduct</a>.<br>\n--&gt;<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
