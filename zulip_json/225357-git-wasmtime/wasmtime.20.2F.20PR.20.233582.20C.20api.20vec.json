This only performs a shallow copy of the vector, which means that you can end up with a double-free once both clones are freed.</p>\n<p>The second issue is that the <code>wasm_*_vec_new</code> functions are supposed to take ownership of objects in the given slice, not clone them. This is apparent if you look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api/blob/c9d31284651b975f05ac27cee0bab1377560b87e/include/wasm.h#L85\">declaration</a> and how it is <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api/blob/c9d31284651b975f05ac27cee0bab1377560b87e/include/wasm.h#L567\">used</a> in the C API header.</p>\n</blockquote>",
