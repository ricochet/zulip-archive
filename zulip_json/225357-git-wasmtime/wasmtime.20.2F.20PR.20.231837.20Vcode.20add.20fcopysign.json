It doesn't and #1838 removes the R_R. Perhaps I should just combine these two patches?

We have no way to specify a 32-bit gpr register so for example instead of RegMem::reg(eax) what is being done in other gpr instruction tests is to use RegMem::reg(rax) but then create a parameter that sets the is_64 bool to false. So to print out ether movl vs movq the reg used is first passed in rbx but the bool determines whether rax or eax is printed. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>// Mov_R_R\ninsns.push((\n    Inst::mov_r_r(false, rbx, w_rsi),\n    &quot;89DE&quot;,\n    &quot;movl    %ebx, %esi&quot;,\n));\n...\ninsns.push((\n    Inst::mov_r_r(true, rbx, w_rsi),\n    &quot;4889DE&quot;,\n    &quot;movq    %rbx, %rsi&quot;,\n));\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>I too started with this parameter for xmm_mov_rm_r when I realized I needed to have the distinction for proper testing, but it was somewhat redundant and heavyweight to add this parameter everywhere as the opcode itself already specifies the operand size.

In that patch we could create another enum called something like SseDtMixedOpcode (standing for sse data transfer mixed register opcode or something distinguishing like that) to show that the operand's registers aren't all the same category. However doing that seems to not do much more than organize the instructions at a finer granularity of SSE instruction which then opens the door for many more categories at that same granularity (for example: xmm only data transfer instructions, sse scalar arithmetic, packed arithmetic, sse comparison, sse conversion, etc) which maybe has the downfall of organizing a lot of new data structures that instead of simplifying, just creates more logic that is duplicated across lowering. I'd be happy to do that though as it does give more organization which in general feels like a good thing, but we also could just keep the one SSE instruction category which maybe simplifies things (distinguishing only from GPR, AVX, etc):</p>\n<p>![image](<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45402135/85326562-58fdd600-b482-11ea-93b3-e3bc9cd130c6.png\">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45402135/85326562-58fdd600-b482-11ea-93b3-e3bc9cd130c6.png</a>)</p>\n<p>Any more thoughts here?</p>\n</blockquote>",

The useful information in <code>xmm_mov_rm_r</code> is really the part about <code>xmm</code> (this is for float registers) and about <code>mov</code> (this is for moves); the rest of it requires to be aware of the x86 jargon, and doesn't bring new information compared to what's is in the <code>Inst</code> variant struct fields. Also, in my opinion trying to enforce a 1:1 mapping on Inst name to the list of instructions that use it is the best way to make sure that comments and code stay <strong>out of</strong> sync over a long period of time. It also makes the code generating these Inst variants very hard to read, because this naming hides what's really interesting at the lowering level (= the semantics) by giving a preference to the implementation detail (= the encoding).</p>\n</blockquote>",

Do you mean, it creates a lot of new top level <code>Inst</code> cases?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sorry, I wasn't clear here. I was wondering if having whichever extra structures needed ... including the ones you quickly put together above, adds more logic to consider or patch and to eventually get \"out of sync\" as @bnjbvr points out. The advantage that see is that it feels like it organizes things so that they are more orderly, but not sure if it truly does do that or if it just hurts readability by giving you that many more puzzle pieces to reason and figure out how the lowering is taking place. The more code to break, the more puzzle pieces (structs, match cases, etc) to consider, is what I meant by complexity. So while I agree with @bnjbvr who I think summed my thoughts better, I do wonder if there is more benefit to having this organization than I initially see and if it the long run we'd regret not having that finer granularity of lowering detail. Frankly, I'll be happy to implement either way ... and not sure who will make that call since there is a difference of opinion here, but I am thinking any change could be saved for a separate pr?</p>\n</blockquote>",
