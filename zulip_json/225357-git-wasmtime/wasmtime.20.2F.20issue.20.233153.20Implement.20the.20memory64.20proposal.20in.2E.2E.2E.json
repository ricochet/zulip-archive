Chanaging that to <code>u8</code> I think would reduce the size of this enum back to 16 bytes. Changing to <code>u16</code> and removing <code>Opcode</code> would also reduce the enum back to 16 bytes.</li>\n<li>I was also looking at using <code>ir::Constant</code> instead of <code>Uimm64</code> but that felt somewhat heavyweight for this use case because it seems like it would frequently allocate in the constant pool. There also didn't appear to be many helper functions going from a <code>Constant</code> to a <code>u64</code> (or some other integral type) so this felt like I was too far off the beaten path.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do others have alternative ideas that could be implemented, or guidance on which of the above paths is the way to go here?</p>\n</blockquote>",

The <code>heap_addr</code> instruction does indeed document its immediate as an access size, but that's not technically how the wasm backend is using it. <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/ee3ff526617f3acdba500673a45675772b34d916/cranelift/wasm/src/code_translator.rs#L2224-L2234\">When translating</a>, assuming there's a guard page, we feign the access size as the fixed offset in the memory instruction. We don't technically actually access all those bytes, but for the purposes of validation it's sufficient.</p>\n<p>Put another way, because wasm memory offsets can be 64-bits (with memory64), and because we use this offset as the \"access size\", that's the motivation for increasing the bit-width of the access size. </p>\n</blockquote>",

The reason I'm hesitant to just accept the 64-bit immediate and corresponding <code>InstructionData</code> growth is that I think the latter will have a surprisingly large impact on compile-time performance; allocating the space only when needed (via another instruction) should be more efficient, even though it's less theoretically clean.</p>\n</blockquote>",

That would involve doing some sort of trap-if-overflow check, but that means that every memory access would have 2 branches instead of one as with this PR. I was hoping to avoid that because I'm assuming the perf hit is already quite large and making it even larger could be worse.</p>\n<p>I think it would work for the time being, but I wanted to explore possibilities to update the cranelift instruction. I think it makes sense to not inflate 16 bytes to 24 bytes, but I wasn't having much luck brainstorming possibilities of how to keep it under 16 bytes (unless we want to change heap indexes to u8 and disallow 256+ heaps (which I'm not sure why we'd want anyway)</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'd expect that most Wasm producers use offsets for things like structs and it would be very strange to have an offset that large, so in my thinking at least, it makes sense to treat this as a \"needed for correctness but can be slow\" corner. I may be misunderstanding the issue though?</p>\n<p>Re: heap count, I'd be hesitant about limiting to 256 heaps; we might bump our heads on that in the future multi-module / component world (e.g. heap per Wasm component, with 300 components in a very large dependency graph -- at least, that's not totally implausible).</p>\n</blockquote>",
