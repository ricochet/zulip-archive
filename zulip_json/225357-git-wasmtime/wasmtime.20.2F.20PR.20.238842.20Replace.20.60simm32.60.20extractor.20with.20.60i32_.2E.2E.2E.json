Nowadays an <code>Imm64</code> needs to be interpreted with the type known as well to understand whether bits being masked off is significant or not. The old <code>simm32</code> extractor only took <code>Imm64</code> meaning that it was unable to do this and wouldn't match negative numbers. This is because the high 32 bits of <code>Imm64</code> were always zero and <code>simm64</code> would take the <code>i64</code> value from <code>Imm64</code> and try to convert it to an <code>i32</code>.</p>\n<p>This commit replaces <code>simm32</code>, and uses of it, with a new extractor <code>i32_from_iconst</code>. This matches the preexisting <code>i64_from_iconst</code> and is able to take the type of the value into account and produce a correctly sign-extended value.</p>\n<p>cc #8706</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
