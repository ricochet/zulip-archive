I always love getting rid of dependencies.</p>\n<p>But this is only stabilized in 1.70, right? We're having issues building Wasmtime with 1.70 for two of our target platforms (risc-v and s390). As far as I understand, the issues we've run into will be fixed by 1.71, so I don't think we're going to try to work around the 1.70 issues.</p>\n<p>As a result, I would like to wait on merging this until 1.71 is out. But at that point I am interested in merging this! Please remind me to look at this again once that release is out.</p>\n</blockquote>",
