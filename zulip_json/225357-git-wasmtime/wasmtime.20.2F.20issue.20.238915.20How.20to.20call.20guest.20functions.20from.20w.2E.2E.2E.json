In this latest attempt to see how far I can go, I have focused only on the <code>Serialize</code> on the guest and <code>Serializer</code> on the host part, for which the wit file is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/wasmtime-ser/wit/serde-ser.wit\">https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/wasmtime-ser/wit/serde-ser.wit</a></p>\n<p>Let's take the example of <code>serialize_some</code>, which is added to the linker here: <a href=\"https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider/bindings.rs#L524-L558\">https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider/bindings.rs#L524-L558</a>. After some setup, we need to wrap the to-serialize resource we got from the guest inside <code>SerializableSerialize</code> so that <code>serde</code> can serialize it, which happens by calling the <code>serialize</code> method on the guest here: <a href=\"https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider/bindings.rs#L543-L544\">https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider/bindings.rs#L543-L544</a>.</p>\n<p>The question is where to get the <code>guest</code> from. At the moment, the <code>SerializableSerialize</code> just provides it via a <code>todo!()</code> here: <a href=\"https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider.rs#L892\">https://github.com/juntyr/serde-wit/blob/542a831d91e271a455ea3be6b383b62e15472256/src/ser/wasmtime_host/provider.rs#L892</a>.</p>\n<p>So, to sum up, we're inside a hostside resource method and need to call a guestside resource method. The hostside method is defined when setting up the linker, but as far as I can tell the guestside method is only retrieved when we instantiate the components after linking (at least that's what the bindings code seems to do). Is there a way in the hostside callback to dynamically get the guestside method, or can we somehow feed the guestside method back into the hostside code?</p>\n<p>Thanks for your help!</p>\n</blockquote>",
