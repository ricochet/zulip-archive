For example, Ubuntu-based distributions running on AArch64 tend to use 4 KB pages, while RHEL-based ones prefer 64 KB as the size. Of course, a simple fix could be simply to increase the current hardcoded value (for that platform) from 4 to 64 KB, but I am not sure about the ramifications of that change (It is quite a big jump!).</p>\n<p>cc @bjorn3 @bnjbvr</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't know if we manage allocations at a sub-page granularity level; if so, that would probably be fine to have larger OS page sizes by default.</p>\n<p>(I seem to fuzzily recall there are also security implications related to this, as larger page sizes make it easier to exhaust memory and then predict where a code allocation landed, effectively bypassing ASLR, but that might require additional conditions; maybe someone who's less fuzzy can confirm/contradict this.)</p>\n</blockquote>",

I also tried to make it such that only the text section itself was made executable, but we could also just make whatever pages contain the text section executable, although that will make unrelated bits executable which seems bad.</p>\n<p>I think it's probably fine to just round up to the most generous page sized used on a platform for now. It means that module serialized artifacts will have some extra 0's in them but most modules are going to be larger than 64k anyway. I don't think there's currently any need to optimize the raw format of a module for byte-size, especially since the compressed size will paper over this.</p>\n</blockquote>",
