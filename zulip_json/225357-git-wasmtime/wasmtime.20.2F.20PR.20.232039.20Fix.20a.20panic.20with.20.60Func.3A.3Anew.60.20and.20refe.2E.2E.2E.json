This happens because cranelift isn't configure to enable stack<br>\nmaps but the register allocators expects them to exist when reference<br>\ntypes are seen.</p>\n<p>The fix here is to always enable reference types in cranelift for our<br>\ntrampoline generation and <code>Func::new</code>. This should hopefully ensure that<br>\ntrampolines are generated correctly and they'll just not be able to get<br>\nhooked up to an <code>Instance</code> because validation will prevent reference<br>\ntypes from being used elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>",
