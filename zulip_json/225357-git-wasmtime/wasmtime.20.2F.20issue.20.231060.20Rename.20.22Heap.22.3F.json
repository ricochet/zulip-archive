In the absence of compelling reasons, avoiding confusing name-changes in our public APIs/IR concepts is probably the right call. So I'll go ahead and close this, but others please speak up if you feel strongly about renaming still.</p>\n</blockquote>",

What if we renamed Cranelift's \"Heap\" to \"LinearMemory\", since it's essentially a WebAssembly linear memory with a few more knobs exposed?</p>\n<p>And perhaps we could shorten it to \"linearmem\" in some places, so that <code>heap_addr</code> would be <code>linearmem_addr</code>. Or maybe <code>linmem_addr</code>? Or maybe <code>linear_addr</code>?</p>\n</blockquote>",
