They're unfortunately difficult to add because rustc's output changes over time, but we should probably look in to adding them at some point in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If none are used, a similar error to the handling of the <code>with</code> clause will be reported.</p>\n<p>One wrinkle here is that I had to mark names as used if <code>can_trap</code> returned true, rather than only if it was a name that had a trappable return type. With the more strict interpretation the tests fail, as we test cases where names mentioned in the list don't have any return type. I'm not sure that requiring names in <code>trappable_imports</code> have a trappable error is useful, given that names can overlap between different interfaces.</p>\n</blockquote>",
