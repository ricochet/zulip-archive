Many of these lowerings are mirrored from v8/SpiderMonkey and there are a number of improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AVX2 <code>v{p,}broadcast*</code> instructions are added and used when available.</li>\n<li>Float-based splats are much simpler and always a single-instruction</li>\n<li>Integer-based splats don't insert into an uninit xmm value and instead start out with a <code>movd</code> to move into an <code>xmm</code> register. This thoeretically breaks dependencies with prior instructions since <code>movd</code> creates a fresh new value in the destination register.</li>\n<li>Loads are now sunk into all of the instructions. A new extractor, <code>sinkable_load_exact</code>, was added to sink the i8/i16 loads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
