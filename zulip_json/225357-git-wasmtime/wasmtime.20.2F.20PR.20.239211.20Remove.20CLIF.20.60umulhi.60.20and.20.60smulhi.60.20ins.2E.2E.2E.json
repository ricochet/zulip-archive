This commit replaces backend-specific lowerings of <code>umulhi</code> and <code>smulhi</code> with patterns in each backend in respective places. This helps detect when this happens from WebAssembly for example and helps simplify producers as well. The intent of this commit is that when desired the same instructions are emitted as before.</p>\n<p>The downside of this commit is that CLIF is losing the ability to implement <code>umulhi</code> and <code>smulhi</code> on vector types. This was only implemented in the riscv64 and s390x backends and was not used by WebAssembly for example.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Without adding new opcodes to wasm that requires pattern matching at the underlying lowering level anyway, so my hope was to go ahead and start moving in that direction.</p>\n</blockquote>",

While it should still be possible to get the same performance/semantics with this PR, the more I think about this the more I've started to sour on the idea. One of the other main motivations for this PR was that the ISLE optimization today to pattern-match an open-coded <code>umulhi</code> doesn't work for i128 when <code>isplit</code> is used to acquire the top bits instead of a shift-then-reduce. It might be best to work on that instead and keep these instructions as-is for produces to use and from wasm it'd mostly be the ISLE optimizations that create the instructions.</p>\n</blockquote>",
