Consider the following example from the x64 lowerings (line numbers added for clarity):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Common Lisp\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">13:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">rule</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">sse_xor_op</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">$F32X4</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">SseOpcode.Xorps</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"nv\">14:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">rule</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">sse_xor_op</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">$F64X2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">SseOpcode.Xorpd</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"nv\">15:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">rule</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">sse_xor_op</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">multi_lane</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">_bits</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">_lanes</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">SseOpcode.Pxor</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Rule 15 overlaps separately with rules 13 and 14, but rules 13 and 14 don't overlap with each other. With overlap checking enabled this will be reported as an overlap of all three rules, where the rule on line 15 will be identified as the source of the overlap (error messages could definitely be improved here). In this case the overlap can be resolved by setting a lower priority for rule 3.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">Error</span>:\n  <span class=\"err\">×</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">overlap</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">error</span>: <span class=\"nc\">rules</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">are</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">overlapping</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"err\">│</span><span class=\"w\">   </span><span class=\"o\">../</span><span class=\"n\">x64</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isle</span>:<span class=\"mi\">15</span>:<span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"err\">│</span><span class=\"w\">   </span><span class=\"o\">../</span><span class=\"n\">x64</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isle</span>:<span class=\"mi\">13</span>:<span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"err\">│</span><span class=\"w\">   </span><span class=\"o\">../</span><span class=\"n\">x64</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isle</span>:<span class=\"mi\">14</span>:<span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>For another example, consider the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Common Lisp\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">1:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">rule</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">example</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">$F32</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">25</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">...</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"nv\">2:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">rule</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">example</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">$F32</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">fallible_extractor</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">y</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">...</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"nv\">3:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">rule</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">example</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">$F64</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">_</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">...</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In this case, only the rules on lines 1 and 2 overlap, as we don't know that the fallible extractor won't fire successfully on the input <code>25</code>.

I'd suggest inlining it there, and here's why:</p>\n<p>If you change <code>Errors</code> to contain a <code>HashMap</code>, then you could establish an invariant that every node in the map has non-zero degree. That's useful because <code>Errors::is_empty</code> can just call <code>HashMap::is_empty</code>, and <code>Errors::report</code> doesn't need to filter the set of nodes to find non-empty ones.</p>\n<p>That invariant automatically holds initially and after any sequence of calls to <code>add_edge</code>.

How could HashSet be that much slower? I feel like there must have been something else going on. (While trying to come up with hypotheses that might explain the difference, I worked out that the HashSet is smaller than the <code>Vec&lt;bool&gt;</code> as long as a rule overlaps with less than 11% of the other rules, but that doesn't seem likely to answer the question.)</p>\n<p>Also, in the long run I don't want to optimize for the case where there are a bunch of overlap errors if doing that makes things worse when there aren't any errors. While we're fixing the current backlog of overlaps, of course, it's reasonable to try to keep the debug loop short.

Paired with the one-off allocation strategy when we need to start adding overlap edges, it feels like this is a reasonable strategy to keep, but if you'd rather go back to the <code>HashSet</code> I'm not opposed.</p>\n</blockquote>",

So tiny differences in how long that method takes get multiplied out to big runtime differences, which is why two data structures show significantly different performance despite both supporting O(1) access. Even the bounds-checks in the vector version have a measurable impact, if I remember the <code>perf</code> report correctly.</p>\n<p>It looks like wildcard handling is currently exponential. We investigated ways to reduce that and Trevor has some things he's planning to try. I think fixing this may not only improve runtime but also fix some false positives in the overlap check.</p>\n</blockquote>",
