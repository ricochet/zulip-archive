We log things like how<br>\nmany parameters a basic block has, the color of virtual registers during<br>\nregalloc, etc. Even for Cranelift hackers, these things are largely only useful<br>\nwhen hacking specifically on Cranelift and looking at a particular test case,<br>\nnot even when using some Cranelift embedding (such as Wasmtime).</p>\n<p>Most of the time, when people want logging for their Rust programs, they do<br>\nsomething like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>RUST_LOG=debug cargo run\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This means that they get all that mostly not useful debug logging out of<br>\nCranelift. So they might want to disable logging for Cranelift, or change it to<br>\na higher log level:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>RUST_LOG=debug,cranelift=info cargo run\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The problem is that this is already more annoying to type that <code>RUST_LOG=debug</code>,<br>\nand that Cranelift isn't one single crate, so you actually have to play<br>\nwhack-a-mole with naming all the Cranelift crates off the top of your head,<br>\nsomething more like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>RUST_LOG=debug,cranelift=info,cranelift_codegen=info,cranelift_wasm=info,...\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Therefore, we're changing most of the <code>debug!</code> logs into <code>trace!</code> logs: anything<br>\nthat is very Cranelift-internal, unlikely to be useful/meaningful to the<br>\n\"average\" Cranelift embedder, or prints a message for each instruction visited<br>\nduring a pass. On the other hand, things that just report a one line statistic<br>\nfor a whole pass, for example, are left as <code>debug!</code>. The more verbose the log<br>\nmessages are, the higher the bar they must clear to be <code>debug!</code> rather than<br>\n<code>trace!</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
