This attribute is an optionally-specified function<br>\nwhich is to be executed after the return value has been processed by the<br>\ncaller to optionally clean-up the return value. This enables, for<br>\nexample, returning an allocated string and the host then knows how to<br>\nclean it up to prevent memory leaks in the original module.</p>\n<p>The API exposed in this PR changes the prior <code>TypedFunc::call</code> API in<br>\nbehavior but not in its signature. Previously the <code>TypedFunc::call</code><br>\nmethod would set the <code>may_enter</code> flag on the way out, but now that<br>\noperation is deferred until a new <code>TypedFunc::post_return</code> method is<br>\ncalled. This means that once a method on an instance is invoked then<br>\nnothing else can be done on the instance until the <code>post_return</code> method<br>\nis called. Note that the method must be called irrespective of whether<br>\nthe <code>post-return</code> canonical ABI option was specified or not. Internally<br>\nwasm will be invoked if necessary.</p>\n<p>This is a pretty wonky and unergonomic API to work with. For now I<br>\ncouldn't think of a better alternative that improved on the ergonomics.<br>\nIn the theory that the raw Wasmtime bindings for a component may not be<br>\nused all that heavily (instead <code>wit-bindgen</code> would largely be used) I'm<br>\nhoping that this isn't too much of an issue in the future.</p>\n<p>cc #4185</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
