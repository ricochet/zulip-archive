You can convert wasm file to wat format with wabt and find the mutation operation in line 9974(replace \"i32.sub\" with \"i32.div_s\"). Releated files is <a href=\"https://github.com/luxinyi0105/wasm_runtime_test/raw/main/07-26.zip\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that the process of compiling c files with Emscripten uses -O0 optimization option in order to prevent the introduction of problems releated with compiler optimization. Given the execution results of wasmedge and WAMR, I think that the result of Wasmtime should either output the correct checksum or trigger internal exception handling logic to output runtime errors, rather than the current situation where there is nothing.</p>\n<p>As for <code>testcase_2.wasm</code>, I tried again in my local environment. The \"original\" wasm file indeed print nothing, but when I renamed the file to submit it, the renamed file output the correct checksum. <a href=\"https://github.com/luxinyi0105/wasm_runtime_test/raw/main/mutated_file_3302.wasm\">Here</a> is the \"original\" wasm file, and why this problem occurs is not very clear yet.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The mutation there is changing a subtraction of the stack pointer into a division of the stack pointer which means that the wasm module's in-memory shadow-stack pointer is getting corrupted. Notably what this causes is the stack to get misaligned.</p>\n<p>Looking at the output more closely, you can see this with <code>RUST_LOG=trace wasmtime run mutated.wasm</code> and you'll see:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"p\">.</span>\n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">TRACE</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">wasi_common</span>::<span class=\"n\">snapshots</span>::<span class=\"n\">preview_1</span>::<span class=\"n\">wasi_snapshot_preview1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">wiggle</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">abi</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">module</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"wasi_snapshot_preview1\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">function</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"fd_write\"</span>\n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">TRACE</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">tracing</span>::<span class=\"n\">span</span>::<span class=\"n\">active</span><span class=\"w\">                                     </span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"nc\">wiggle</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">abi</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">TRACE</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">wasi_common</span>::<span class=\"n\">snapshots</span>::<span class=\"n\">preview_1</span>::<span class=\"n\">wasi_snapshot_preview1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">fd</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">Fd</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">iovs</span><span class=\"o\">=*</span><span class=\"n\">guest</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">0x7fd</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span>\n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">TRACE</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">wasi_common</span>::<span class=\"n\">snapshots</span>::<span class=\"n\">preview_1</span>::<span class=\"n\">wasi_snapshot_preview1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">result</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nb\">Err</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Error</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">inner</span>: <span class=\"nc\">Inval</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">})</span>\n<span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"p\">.</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here you can see that <code>fd_write</code> (the \"print to screen\" function) is returning <code>Inval</code> which is <code>EINVAL</code> in the guest. The reason for this is that the guest pointer, 0x7fd, is not aligned to a 4-byte boundary. My guess is that this is being called with <code>printf</code> with a buffer from the stack and the mutation which cause the stack to get misaligned is threading through to here.</p>\n<p>Wasmtime's <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> implementation enforces alignment which I would assume the other runtimes you're testing are not enforcing. Alignment for all types is documented but what to do with misaligned values is a bit of an edge case I think today in the sense that I'm at least not myself aware of a strict requirement on what to do. The component model, which WASI is now being defined with, strictly indicates what to do with alignment, but for preview1 it's at least less clear to me.</p>\n<p>@sunfishcode or @pchickey I'm curious, but have y'all had discussions in the WASI subgroup about this? This is only an issue for preview1 at this point due to the component model otherwise saying what to do. I'm also not sure if this is already documented elsewhere as \"alignment must be respected\" or not in preview1</p>\n</blockquote>",
