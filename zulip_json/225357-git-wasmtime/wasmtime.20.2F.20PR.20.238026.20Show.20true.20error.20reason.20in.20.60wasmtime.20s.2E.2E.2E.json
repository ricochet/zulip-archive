After looking at long dumps of <code>guest never invoked </code>response-outparam::set<code> method</code>, I realized that errors inside the Tokio <code>task</code> are never propagated outwards. This change captures those errors and appends them to the printed error message.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

But maybe I missed something or perhaps future changes will invalidate that. But in that case, <code>wasmtime serve</code> will be dumping errors to stderr anyways so it should be apparent to users that something is wrong apart from the (hypothetical) additional slowdown. And they'll probably care more about whatever caused the task to fail.</p>\n</blockquote>",
