This PR adds those instructions to the x64 backend. The lowerings for some of these instructions already existed but those that didn't--<code>i64x2.ge_s</code> and <code>i64x2.le_s</code>--have been lowered by comparing the flipped operands with <code>PCMPGTQ</code> (in effect, asking to emit <code>lt</code> for <code>ge</code> and <code>gt</code> for <code>le</code>) and then negating the results.</p>\n</blockquote>",
