Also, I don't think it is a bad thing to have multiple mutators at work here. <code>wasm-mutate</code> is far from complete, so keeping the raw libfuzzer mutator around is good.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Depending on the coverage from this I think it would be great to hook into the \"actually run code\" fuzz targets at some point but that's fine to do later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, agreed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For a corpus, could we just run wasm-smith on a bunch of inputs, throw all the outputs in a directory, and then shrink it based on coverage?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, probably good to add the sightglass benchmarks and any other Wasm binaries we have lying around too. More is better! Can always shrink the corpus after the fact.</p>\n</blockquote>",
