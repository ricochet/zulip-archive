We don't need a hash-set to determine whether we already added a register to an array when we can just add it to a PRegSet and then extract a suitable array out of that.</p>\n<p>This change also makes the computed array sorted, which isn't particularly important since the backends all modify it and then sort it again, but is generally a nice property to have.</p>\n</blockquote>",
