Additionally this plumbs more support throughout Wasmtime to support type imports, namely that they do not need to be supplied through a <code>Linker</code>. This additionally implements a feature where empty instances, even transitively, do not need to be supplied by a Wasmtime embedder. This means that instances which only have types, for example, do not need to be supplied into a <code>Linker</code> since no runtime information for them is required anyway.</p>\n<p>Closes #5775</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
