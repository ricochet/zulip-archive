We are not currently a user of wasmtime/cranelift on arm32 but we have been evaluating projects to potentially target wasm via wasmtime on our fleet of IoT hubs.  To consider use of wasmtime/cranelift, arm32 support is a must as we continue to support software updates for a very large number of products using arm32 (in addition to products based on aarch64/x86_64/etc.) and would guess that this is true for other potential users in this space.  Thus far, one of the reasons we have not yet built solutions around wasm is the lack of arm32 support which we had hoped would be something that would get love from ARM or others.</p>\n<p>I will reach out to some of my contacts within the broader Samsung org to see if we are currently in a position to provide any assistance; I do feel that if IoT is in fact an area where we would like wasmtime/cranelift to be applicable along with the goal of providing a portable bytecode that arm32 support is a critical feature.</p>\n</blockquote>",

So, if someone were to jump in and adopt the arm32 backend, it would need to be somewhat soon.</p>\n<p>I don't doubt the value of arm32 at all, and all else being equal, would love to have full and complete support for it! It's really just a matter of resources. And, it's worth mentioning that if we do end up removing it from the tree now, someone would always be welcome to step in, grab the old source from git history as a starting point, and bring it up to date, then contribute it, as long as there is a reasonable ongoing-maintenance story.</p>\n</blockquote>",
