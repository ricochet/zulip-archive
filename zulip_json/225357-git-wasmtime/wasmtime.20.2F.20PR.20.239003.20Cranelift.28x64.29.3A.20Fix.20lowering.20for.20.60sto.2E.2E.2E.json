Because Cranelift allows <code>b{and,or,xor}</code>s on floating point types, that means we might need to insert a move from an XMM to a GPR.</p>\n<p>Found in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8941\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8941</a> but is actually unrelated to safepoints and stack maps, they just made this pattern more likely to occur. AFAICT, Wasm can't ever trigger this bug, and would only be something of concern for other CLIF producers.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
