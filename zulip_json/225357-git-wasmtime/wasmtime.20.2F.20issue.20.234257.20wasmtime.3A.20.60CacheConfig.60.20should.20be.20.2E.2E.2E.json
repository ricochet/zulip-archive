It predates most of the current API design so I think moving individual options to a <code>Config</code> like structure is likely a significant undertaking and I'm not sure that it's the best design to have.</p>\n<p>In general I'm not sure how to configure the cache and ideally Wasmtime would be more flexible about its caching strategies to allow external implementations of caching rather than requiring a built-in one. Before refactoring the methods around <code>Config</code> here it may be better to see how features like <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4155\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4155</a> will end up getting designed with <code>Config</code> or otherwise how they'll be configured.</p>\n</blockquote>",
