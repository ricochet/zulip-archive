It's nice to have a proper API to make sense of it!</p>\n<p>One request, though: in wasmparser, most of the trait functions return a <code>&amp;Self::Type</code> (or <code>&amp;Self::FuncType</code>, etc.), which makes it a bit hard to implement in some places. For instance, our Type representation is a plain packed u32 at the moment: the ret type being a borrow makes it hard to return a plain primitive value. Could it be a <code>Cow&lt;Self::Type&gt;</code> instead? (Unless there's a better API for this of course; my Rust knowledge is reaching its boundaries here.)</p>\n<p>Because of the above issue, I haven't gone through implementing it entirely in Spidermonkey.
