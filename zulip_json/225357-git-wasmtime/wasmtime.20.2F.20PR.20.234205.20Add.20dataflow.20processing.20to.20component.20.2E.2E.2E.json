At the same<br>\ntime this fills out a few other missing details to component processing<br>\nsuch as aliasing from some kinds of component instances and similar.</p>\n<p>The major changes contained within this are the updates the <code>info</code><br>\nsubmodule which has the AST of component type information. This has been<br>\nsignificantly refactored to prepare for representing lowered functions<br>\nand implementing those. The major change is from an <code>Instantiation</code> list<br>\nto an <code>Initializer</code> list which abstractly represents a few other<br>\ninitialization actions.</p>\n<p>This work is split off from my main work to implement component imports<br>\nof host functions. This is incomplete in the sense that it doesn't<br>\nactually finish everything necessary to define host functions and import<br>\nthem into components. Instead this is only the changes necessary at the<br>\ntranslation layer (so far). Consequently this commit does not have tests<br>\nand also namely doesn't actually include the <code>VMComponentContext</code><br>\ninitialization and usage. The full body of work is still a bit too messy<br>\nto PR just yet so I'm hoping that this is a slimmed-down-enough piece to<br>\nadequately be reviewed.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
