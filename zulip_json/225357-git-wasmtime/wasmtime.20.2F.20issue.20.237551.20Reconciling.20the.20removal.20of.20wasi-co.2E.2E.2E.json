This means that Wasmtime (and the <code>wasmtime</code> CLI) now has two entirely separate implementations of the preview1 snapshot of WASI. This is not something I think we should retain indefinitely, so I think it's worthwhile to plan for the removal of the old <code>wasi-common</code> crate. </p>\n<p>The only technical blocker I'm aware of for this is that the preview2-based implementation of <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> does not support WASI threads. Effectively if a thread is spawned then all WASI functions will stop working because the WASI context is no longer uniquely owned. More-or-less this boils down to <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/bba4ee78a98236e73540506ffebab91373791a82/src/commands/run.rs#L830\">this panic</a> which would be dynamically triggered. There is no way right now to share the WASI context amongst threads and have functions continue to work (e.g. <code>poll</code> working concurrently on multiple threads).</p>\n<p>There's definitely a lot of issues on the surface that look like incompatibilities, such as liberal usage of <code>&amp;mut Table</code> and <code>&amp;mut self</code>, but I think much of this can be updated with relative ease to work with <code>&amp;Table</code> that has some internal synchronization which gives temporary access to <code>&amp;mut self</code> on various objects. The main thing I don't know how to solve at this time, however, is how blocking works.</p>\n<p>Currently all blocking computations in Wasmtime's implementation of WASI are represented as a <code>Future</code>. This is chiefly done through the <code>Subscribe</code> trait:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">#[async_trait::async_trait]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">trait</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Subscribe</span>: <span class=\"nb\">Send</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">Sync</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"nb\">static</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">async</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">ready</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The usage of <code>&amp;mut self</code> here is problematic because the same I/O object could be subscribe to from multiple threads which means <code>&amp;mut</code> exclusive access is not possible. More-or-less what theoretically needs to happen is to push the <code>&amp;self</code> into this method to enable waiting for readiness on objects on multiple threads simultaenously. Each thread would create its own future in <code>poll</code> and then it'd get arbitrated internally. This is, however, a very large refactoring and departure from the current design, one that I don't think can easily be done and I think may have unknown consequences (e.g. more-than-expected overhead in the single-threaded use case).</p>\n<p>This conclusion brings me to opening this issue for more discussion.</p>\n<p>cc @abrown </p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm not sure I completely understand why removing <code>wasi-common</code> requires removing <code>wasi-threads</code>. Is it just the dependency? Can't wasi-threads still work for non-component modules?</li>\n<li>aren't we going to have to deal with <code>&amp;mut self</code> to <code>&amp;self</code> issues at some point with the next thing? The next thing will still need to access these futures from multiple threads, no?
