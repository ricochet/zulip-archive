In the future we'll want to <code>zx_object_wait_async</code>/ports and register with a global exception handling thread</li>\n<li>The convention for registering a fault handler</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know that these syscalls are super unfamiliar so I'm happy to provide context. I've also unfortunately chosen to use the lowest level bindings since they are our most stable interface for out-of-tree Rust code.</p>\n<p>cc/ @leecam</p>\n</blockquote>",
