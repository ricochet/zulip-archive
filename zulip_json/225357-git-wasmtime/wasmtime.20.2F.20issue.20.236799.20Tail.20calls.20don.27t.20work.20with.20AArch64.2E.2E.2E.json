I'll admit though that I don't fully understand the implications of this and if that makes it too easy to \"guess\" the return pointer or forge it by accident or something like that. I'm also not sure whether the current <code>pacibsp</code> is required for ABI reasons, but at least from my naive current reading I think that functionally the <code>tail</code> convention could switch to <code>pacibz</code> and <code>autibz</code> functionally at least.</li>\n<li>Instead of using <code>autibsp</code> the <code>autib</code> instruction could be used which uses a \"modifier\" in an arbitrary register. That way the old stack pointer could be calculated in a non-stack-pointer register (e.g. the fp+16) and the original <code>pacibsp</code> would be paired with <code>autib $tmp</code> or something like that.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

They should be a workable drop-in replacement when using the <code>tail</code> convention in Cranelift I think to ensure all functions have pointer auth right.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm a bit surprised that we didn't catch this earlier</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's probably because we don't have pointer authentication enabled in QEMU so AFAIK the only way to run into this is on macOS aarch64 hardware. I don't run the cranelift tests that often locally so I first ran into it recently after <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6774\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6774</a>.</p>\n<p>I believe at the time of the original writing QEMU didn't support pointer authentication (or something like that). If it does support it now, which it may, then we'll want to configure it to turn that on and it should get auto-detected with <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> support I believe.
