For example I think it'd be good to have some basic crate documentation explaining what things are (as nothing has rustdoc internally otherwise) and ideally we'd also have a <code>README.md</code> explaining a bit about how to use it (as that'll get rendered on <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>).
