Removing it eliminates some complexity around wrapping expressions as bindings and vice versa. It also clears up some confusion about which category to put certain constructs in (arguments and extractors) by refusing to have different categories.</p>\n<p>While I was writing this patch I also realized that <code>add_match_variant</code> and <code>normalize_equivalence_classes</code> both need to do fundamentally the same things with enum variants, so I refactored them to share code and make their relationship clearer.</p>\n<p>Finally, I reviewed all the comments in this file and fixed some places where they could be more clear.</p>\n</blockquote>",
