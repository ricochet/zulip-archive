It's the only fuzz target that can exercise a variable number of modules/instances within the store (although they still aren't linked to one another). I do think that its usefulness has decreased over time but not to the point that I think it should go away. </p>\n<p>It's also theoretically a great place to add more API calls in the future too!</p>\n</blockquote>",
