I can see where this is useful for libcalls, in case you want to substitute another library.  But for something like <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code>, that name is defined by the ABI and hard-coded into the linker, there is no way to override this anyway.</p>\n<p>So maybe it would be simpler to just add a feature to allow the backend to simply hard-code a symbol name?</p>\n</blockquote>",

When creating an object file used by the system linker, the name has to be exactly this string as specified by the ABI, otherwise the required special processing will not trigger in the linker.  If we re-implement linker functionality in the JIT, the JIT will simply have to perform that special processing itself, which should not involve any symbol name at all.   There is no scenario I can envision where it makes sense to replace a reference to <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code> with a reference to some symbol with another name.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

This will lead the generated code to effectively, instead, load the TLS section offset from the constant pool and add the current thread pointer, with no libcall involved.</p>\n<p>W.r.t. implementing TLS in the JIT, I guess that depends to a large extent on what exactly should be supported.   But the fact that we add the thread pointer in itself doesn't change much - if nothing better is possible, you can always implement <code>__tls_get_offset</code> in terms of your <code>__tls_get_addr</code> implementation and just subtract the current thread pointer before returning.</p>\n<p>This will require overloading <code>__tls_get_offset</code> (and <code>__tls_get_addr</code>) - but those are (and should remain) normal libcalls that can already be overloaded by the JIT.</p>\n<p>This discussion is about <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code>, which is needed here as parameter to <code>__tls_get_offset</code>.   (Of course there can also be other uses of <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code> unrelated to TLS.)   This has to be handled by the JIT itself, because whatever value is used as <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code> must match the GOT start that is also used to resolve GOT-relative relocations.
