They don't matter to the engines for the most part (an engine can handle 10 instructions just as well as 100 instructions) and they don't make sense for the single-instruction modules (they always only have 1 instruction). That's when I switched from adapting a single-instance module to a <code>ModuleConfig/SwarmConfig</code> and instead started adapting a <code>ModuleConfig/SwarmConfig</code> to this new <code>ModuleFeatures</code>. Would you be more in favor of this struct if I added the remaining Wasm features to it?</p>\n</blockquote>",
