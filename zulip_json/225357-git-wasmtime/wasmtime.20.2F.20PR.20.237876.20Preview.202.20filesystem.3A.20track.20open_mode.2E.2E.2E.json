This test now reproduces the behavior reported in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7829\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7829</a>. wasi-common passes this changed test, but wasmtime-wasi::preview2 does not, showing that this is a regression between the two implementations.</p>\n<p>Then, in preview2 implementation, track open_mode for a File and Dir, and use that instead of reporting permissions in DescriptorFlags.</p>\n<p>FilePerms/DirPerms is a way of having wasmtime-wasi, instead of the operating system, mediate permissions on a preview2 Descriptor. This was conflated with the open mode, which should determine whether DescriptorFlags contains READ or WRITE or MUTATE_DIRECTORY.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>don't mask FilePerms with the DescriptorFlags (oflags) in path_open</li>\n<li>File and Dir now track their open_mode (represented using FilePerms)<br>\n  and report them in DescriptorFlags<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

From the python test suite I found that futime is expected to succeed even when a file is read-only. So, I'll have to change this test, as well as set-len to check the open mode and reject size changes when not open for writing (fail with EINVAL, which I prefer here to EBADF) but permit set-times.</p>\n</blockquote>",
