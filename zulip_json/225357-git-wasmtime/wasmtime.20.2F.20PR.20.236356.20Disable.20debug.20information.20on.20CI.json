Locally a <code>./ci/run-tests.sh</code> compile produces a ~13G build directory. Testing on CI it looks like Windows builders have ~13G of free space on them for GitHub Actions. I think something in that PR has tipped us just over the edge of requiring too much space, although I'm not sure exactly what.</p>\n<p>To address the issue this commit disables DWARF debug information entirely on all builders on CI. Not only should this save a sliver of compile time but this reduces a local build directory to ~4.7G, over a 50% reduction. That should keep us fitting in CI for more time to come hopefully.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
