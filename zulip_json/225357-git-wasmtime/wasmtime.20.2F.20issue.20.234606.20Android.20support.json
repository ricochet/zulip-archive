I would expect all this toolchain configuration to be configured by whomever is building <code>wasmtime-c-api</code> rather than hardcoded into cmake files. I feel like this sort of configuration is also necessary for cross-compiled builds and I don't think we'd want to hardcode everything for that per se?</p>\n<p>This is all sort of on the side and fine to add but I'm not sure if you have a particular end goal for the cmake support in mind or how many other platforms might be added.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This process would be a lot cleaner if the calling CMake project could modify the compiler and libraries used by wasmtime but with ExternalProject you can't do that.</p>\n</blockquote>",
