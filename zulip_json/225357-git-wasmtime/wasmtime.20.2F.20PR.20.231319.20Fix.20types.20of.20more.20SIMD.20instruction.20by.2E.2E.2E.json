The commit messages have more details (many more details) but the bottom line is that without a new type representing Wasm's <code>v128</code>, cranelift needs some <code>raw_bitcast</code> instructions strategically placed in order to type-check. This adds a few more of those <code>raw_bitcast</code>s.</p>\n</blockquote>",
