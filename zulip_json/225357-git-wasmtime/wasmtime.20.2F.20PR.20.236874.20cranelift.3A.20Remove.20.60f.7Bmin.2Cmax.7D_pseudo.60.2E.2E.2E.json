The motivation for this commit is that incorrect optimizations for these instructions were removed in #6859 and likely stemmed from the surprising definitions of these instructions. These originally were intended to correspond to operations in the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly but nowadays the functionality of these instructions is replaced with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lowering from wasm to clif uses the <code>fcmp</code> plus <code>select</code> combo instruction.</li>\n<li>Backends that support optimizing this pattern use ISLE patterns to match the instruction and emit the specialization for the pseudo semantics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means that while the instructions are removed here it should be the case that no functionality is lost and the output of Wasmtime/Cranelift should still be the same as it was before. Existing tests using the pseudo instructions were preserved except the riscv64 ones (where the lowering was deleted) and the dynamic AArch64 ones. Both s390x and x64 continue to have specialized patterns for this compare-plus-select.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
