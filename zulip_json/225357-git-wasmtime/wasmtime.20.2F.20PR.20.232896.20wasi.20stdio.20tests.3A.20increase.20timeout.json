Tests which expect multiple file descriptors to be ready simultaneously have to bound that expectation with a timeout.</p>\n<p>On CI, these tests execute very slowly compared to local development, so this timeout needs to be increased until we don't see CI failures anymore. It has been doubled from the timeouts observed in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2893\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2893</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
