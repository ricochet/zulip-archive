Currently the instruction variant used here requires an aligned <code>XmmMem</code> which is today auto-translated with a 16-byte load unconditionally. For loads near the end of memory this loads too much and can erroneously cause a trap. The fix in this commit is to force the load to happen manually with the appropriate type rather than a 16-byte type.</p>\n<p>I'll note that <code>XmmMem</code> is left as an argument in this case because the AVX variants of these instructions can continue to leverage unaligned accesses. This also means that the test added here won't fail on a machine with AVX support, it needs to be explicitly disabled.</p>\n<p>Closes #8116</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
