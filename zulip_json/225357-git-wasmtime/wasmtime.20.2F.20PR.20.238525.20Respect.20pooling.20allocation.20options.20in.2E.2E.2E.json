Previously the pooling allocator was enabled by default but the options to configure it weren't processed due to how this default-enable was implemented. The option to enable it by default for <code>wasmtime serve</code>, but only <code>wasmtime serve</code>, is now processed differently in a way that handles various other<br>\npooling-allocator-related options.</p>\n<p>Closes #8504</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

The CI failure shows a bug where we're racing between two events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>wasmtime serve</code> process is printing out error information</li>\n<li>The test process is running <code>child.kill()</code> to reap status information as the test is over</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's no way to resolve this race with <code>wasmtime serve</code> right now as there is no graceful shutdown of <code>wasmtime serve</code>. I'd like to add that in the future (e.g. ctrl-c waits for all active connections), but that's a bit out of scope for this. In the meantime it still seems good to get a fix in at least.</p>\n</blockquote>",
