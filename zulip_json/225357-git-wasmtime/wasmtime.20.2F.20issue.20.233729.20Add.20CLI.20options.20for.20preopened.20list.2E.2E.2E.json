To make WASI programs modular and statically analyzable, we want to make API contracts explicit in imports and exports, rather than in dynamic environment-variable conventions. I expect what we'll want in the future is for this to use the Typed Main feature, and then to have WASI libc on the inside translate that back into making <code>getenv(\"LISTEN_FDS\")</code> return this information for compatibility.</p>\n<p>However, we can address that as the pieces needed to use Typed Main come online. For now, this looks good.</p>\n</blockquote>",
