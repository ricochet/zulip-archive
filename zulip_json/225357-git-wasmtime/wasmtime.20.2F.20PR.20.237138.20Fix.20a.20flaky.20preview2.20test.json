For immediately resolving it should be ok to wait for a generous amount of time since the timeout is only a protection against tests hanging. For <code>never_resolves</code> it should be ok to wait a short amount of time and any failure there will show up as a spurious failure.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
