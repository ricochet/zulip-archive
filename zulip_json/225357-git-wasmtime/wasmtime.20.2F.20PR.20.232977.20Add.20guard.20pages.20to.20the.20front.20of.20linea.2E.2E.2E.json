Guard pages placed<br>\nafter linear memories are typically present for performance (at least)<br>\nbecause it can help elide bounds checks. Guard pages before a linear<br>\nmemory, however, are never strictly needed for performance or features.<br>\nThe intention of a preceding guard page is to help insulate against bugs<br>\nin Cranelift or other code generators, such as CVE-2021-32629.</p>\n<p>This commit adds a <code>Config::guard_before_linear_memory</code> configuration<br>\noption, defaulting to <code>true</code>, which indicates whether guard pages should<br>\nbe present both before linear memories as well as afterwards. Guard<br>\nregions continue to be controlled by<br>\n<code>{static,dynamic}_memory_guard_size</code> methods.</p>\n<p>The implementation here affects both on-demand allocated memories as<br>\nwell as the pooling allocator for memories. For on-demand memories this<br>\nadjusts the size of the allocation as well as adjusts the calculations<br>\nfor the base pointer of the wasm memory. For the pooling allocator this<br>\nwill place a singular extra guard region at the very start of the<br>\nallocation for memories. Since linear memories in the pooling allocator<br>\nare contiguous every memory already had a preceding guard region in<br>\nmemory, it was just the previous memory's guard region afterwards. Only<br>\nthe first memory needed this extra guard.</p>\n<p>I've attempted to write some tests to help test all this, but this is<br>\nall somewhat tricky to test because the settings are pretty far away<br>\nfrom the actual behavior. I think, though, that the tests added here<br>\nshould help cover various use cases and help us have confidence in<br>\ntweaking the various <code>Config</code> settings beyond their defaults.</p>\n<p>Note that this also contains a semantic change where<br>\n<code>InstanceLimits::memory_reservation_size</code> has been removed. Instead this<br>\nfield is now inferred from the <code>static_memory_maximum_size</code> and guard<br>\nsize settings. This should hopefully remove some duplication in these<br>\nsettings, canonicalizing on the guard-size/static-size settings as the<br>\nway to control memory sizes and virtual reservations.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
