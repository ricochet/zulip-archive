The fix here is to add a third kind of resource type which represents an uninstantiated component as opposed to an instantiated component or host type.</p>\n<p>Closes #8003</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
