Getting the slice of block params doesn't cost any more than getting its length (I think it adds 4 to a pointer it already computed to get the length, and returns the adjusted pointer along with the length) so I don't think the extra API clutter is worth its weight.</p>\n<p>We can leave <code>DataFlowGraph::num_block_params</code> so we aren't forcing people to change their calls for no reason, but I'd rather not add this function in this new spot.</p>\n</blockquote>",
