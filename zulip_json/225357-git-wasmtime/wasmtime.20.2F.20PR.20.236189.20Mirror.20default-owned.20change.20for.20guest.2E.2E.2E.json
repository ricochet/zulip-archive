The new default is to generate only one Rust type per WIT type input, regardless of if the representation can be slightly more optimal in niche cases with more borrows. This should make the macro easier to work with in the limit ideally.</p>\n<p>Closes #6124</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
