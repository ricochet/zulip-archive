This section's addresses are relative to the <code>DW_AT_low_pc</code> entry located in the <code>DW_TAG_compile_unit</code> container, but Wasmtime's construction of this section didn't take this into account. Instead all addresses in <code>.debug_loc</code> are relative to the start of the compiled object, not to the start of the compile unit itself. This commit fixes this by unconditionally describing <code>DW_TAG_compile_unit</code> locations with <code>DW_AT_ranges</code> instead of <code>DW_AT_low_pc</code>. This ends up fixing debug information for debug information using <code>.debug_loc</code> with multiple codegen units.</p>\n<p>Closes #8752</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
