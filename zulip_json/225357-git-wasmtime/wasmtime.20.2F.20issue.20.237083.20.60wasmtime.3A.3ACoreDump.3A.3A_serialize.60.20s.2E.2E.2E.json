For every <code>pub fn foo&lt;T&gt;</code> that is called, we could create a <code>pub(crate) fn _foo</code> without the <code>T</code> and then call those methods from <code>_serialize</code> and ultimately remove the <code>T</code> from <code>_serialize</code>.</p>\n<p>This would make it so that calling <code>wasmtime::CoreDump::serialize</code> isn't monomorphized for every <code>T</code> in a store passed to it, which can help compile times when there is more than one <code>T</code> used in the program.</p>\n</blockquote>",
