I did at least confirm that in the test case I was looking at, which was \"call import\" in a loop, hoisted the loads outside of the loop.</p>\n<p>The filetest part here is specifically tricky because this is changing Wasmtime's embedding of cranelift which is quite far away from the filetests of Cranelift. Not to say it couldn't be done, but hopefully reasonable enough for now.</p>\n</blockquote>",
