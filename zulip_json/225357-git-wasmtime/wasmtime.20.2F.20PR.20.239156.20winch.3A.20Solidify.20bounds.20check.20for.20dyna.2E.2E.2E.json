Even though offsets and access sizes are validated ahead-of-time and bound to the heap type, in the case of overflow checking, we must ensure that the operation size is tied to the target's pointer size to avoid clamping the access size and offset addition, which would result in missing an out-of-bounds memory access.</p>\n<p>This commit also adds a disassembly test to avoid introducing regressions in the future.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this commit adds more comments around why <code>pointer_size</code> is used for certain bounds checking operations.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
