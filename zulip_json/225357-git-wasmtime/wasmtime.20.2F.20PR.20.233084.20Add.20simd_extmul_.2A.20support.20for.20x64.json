I think now that it is OK because <code>swiden_high</code> only really allows the following types: <code>I8X16</code>, <code>I16X8</code>, <code>I32X4</code>. I think it might be worthwhile to mention this assumption in some comments at the top so that future readers aren't confused.</p>\n<p><div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">v0</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">swiden</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">i64</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div><br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

As it stands in this PR, every <code>imul.i64</code> is going to require a bunch of matching calls and type comparisons before it ever gets lowered. I think scalar multiplication is going to be the most common, then plain vector multiplication, so I would think we would want to make those common paths shorter. (Not sure exactly how much this affects compile time but hopefully you see what I mean).</p>\n</blockquote>",
