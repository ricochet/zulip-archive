We also can run a single test in up to three configurations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As-is with a module</li>\n<li>As a component in \"sync\" mode</li>\n<li>As a component in \"async\" mode</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In debug mode compilation of all these modules can take a significant chunk of time (20-30s in total for test suites) This commit updates these test suites to use an in-memory per-process incremental cache backed by a simple <code>Mutex&lt;HashMap&gt;</code>. This gives some good speedups in debug mode, locally the wasi-common, wasmtime-wasi, and wasmtime-wasi-http test suites were reduced from 32 to 17 seconds. I'd expect larger speedups on less-parallel machines such as our CI.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
