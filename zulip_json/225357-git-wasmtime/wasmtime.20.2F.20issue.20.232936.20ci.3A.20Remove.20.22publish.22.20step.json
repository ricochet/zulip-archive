I personally think it's pretty nice to have though. This JS gob I think is the only complexity in managing that and the previous gob rarely changed until now.</p>\n<p>As for usage, I personally find it useful from time to time to browse the current state of the release. I've also configured language bindings like wasmtime-{py,go} to all pull from the dev releases in their own CI to ensure they work with tip-of-tree.</p>\n<p>Overall I don't think it's worth contorting ourselves too much, but if the current <code>if</code> doesn't get much more sprawling I think it's reasonable.</p>\n</blockquote>",
