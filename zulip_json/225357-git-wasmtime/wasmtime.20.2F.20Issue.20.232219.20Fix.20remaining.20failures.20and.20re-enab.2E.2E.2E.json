When I created <code>Inst::load/Inst::store</code>, I wasn't sure about replacing the stack functions because of the signature difference but, looking at it now, it seems like all that is necessary is a <code>let mem = SyntheticAmode::from(mem)</code>. Using <code>Inst::load/Inst::store</code> has the advantage of de-duplication but also uses the appropriate SSE opcodes for each vector type.</p>\n</blockquote>",
