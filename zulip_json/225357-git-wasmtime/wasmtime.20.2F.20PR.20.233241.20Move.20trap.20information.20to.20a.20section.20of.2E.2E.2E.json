This section is quite large<br>\nand when previously encoded/decoded with <code>bincode</code> this can take quite<br>\nsome time to process. Traps are expected to be relatively rare and it's<br>\nnot necessarily the right tradeoff to spend so much time<br>\nserializing/deserializing this data, so this commit offloads the section<br>\ninto a custom-encoded binary format located elsewhere in the compiled image.</p>\n<p>This is similar to #3240 in its goal which is to move very large pieces<br>\nof metadata to their own sections to avoid decoding anything when we<br>\nload a precompiled modules. This also has a small benefit that it's<br>\nslightly more efficient storage for the trap information too, but that's<br>\na negligible benefit.</p>\n<p>This is part of #3230 to make loading modules fast.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
