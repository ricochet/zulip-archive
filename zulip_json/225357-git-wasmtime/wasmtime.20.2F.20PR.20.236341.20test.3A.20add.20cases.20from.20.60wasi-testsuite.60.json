This involved making the test runner a<br>\nbit more robust to the various shapes of JSON specifications in that<br>\nproject. Unfortunately, the <code>wasi_testsuite</code> test fails some of the<br>\ncases, so I added a <code>WASI_COMMON_IGNORE_LIST</code> to avoid these<br>\ntemporarily. (This may remind some of the Wasm testsuite ignore lists in<br>\nCranelift; those relied on <code>build.rs</code> to create a <code>#[test]</code> for each<br>\ntest case, which I felt is not yet needed here).</p>\n<p>It's unclear to me why some tests are failing. It could be because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wasi-common has a bug</li>\n<li>wasi-testsuite overspecifies (or incorrectly specifies) a test</li>\n<li>the test runner incorrectly configures Wasmtime's CLI execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But this change makes it easier to resolve this. Remove the file from<br>\n<code>WASI_COMMON_IGNORE_LIST</code> and run <code>cargo test wasi_testsuite --\n--nocapture</code>. The printed output will show the expected result, the<br>\nactual result, and a command to replicate the failure from the command<br>\nline.</p>\n<p>[wasi-testsuite]: <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-testsuite\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-testsuite</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
