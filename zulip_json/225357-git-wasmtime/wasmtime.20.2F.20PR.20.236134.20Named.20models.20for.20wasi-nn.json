This will allow WASM host instances to reuse the same model multiple times without having to fully reload it. It currently imposes a hard-coded 10MB limit on the size of models that can be registered from a guest and extends the Backend wasi-nn API so that it can work directly with byte arrays, instead of passing through GuestPtr instances.</p>\n<p>This implementation only caches the compiled graph for CPU execution targets as other targets may consume resources on GPU or TPU hardware, which is not possible to track in a straightforward fashion. In the future, it may become desirable to have visibility over resource usage so that hosts may make more sophisticated decisions about what models are fully cached for execution.</p>\n<p>This PR also updates the WITX to the latest version of the spec as it was previously pointing to a much older commit.</p>\n</blockquote>",
