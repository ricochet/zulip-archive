I've attempted to hack around that on CI by installing beta for all the builders (we'll see how that goes).</p>\n<p>Otherwise though I wanted to go ahead and open this up to get others' thoughts on it to see if others are ok with it or feel like this isn't a great change for Wasmtime.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm in favor of merging it eventually. I'd be inclined to wait for some time after the 1.64 release though: at least a week, maybe a month? For something that's only nice-to-have, I think it's worth giving people who are working in git some slack on when to upgrade their toolchain.</p>\n<p>If this affected people who are depending on any of these crates through <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> then I'd wait longer. But if <code>cargo publish</code> rewrites all of this away during the publish process, then that clearly doesn't matter.</p>\n</blockquote>",
