For what it's worth, <code>hlt</code> is a bit of an odd choice here as well (it can only execute in kernel mode, and I think generates <code>SIGILL</code> in userspace). I guess the idea is that it's not meant to be a \"normal\" transfer of control to the runtime paired with the generated code, but rather a place where a debugger could catch a signal or hook in with <code>ptrace</code> or something of the sort, so setting up state for a \"normal\" runtime invocation to e.g. scan the stack wouldn't be useful. I'm not sure though.</p>\n<p>In the absence of more context here I'm inclined to leave the lowering as-is (translated from existing), but we should definitely ask whether this opcode is even necessary, or at least what its precise guarantees should be, when we get to cleaning up the CLIF opcode space...</p>\n</blockquote>",
