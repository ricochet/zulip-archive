(I suspect bjorn3 already knows all this, having written some of it.)</p>\n<p>In Cranelift, the <code>ABIMachineSpec</code> trait implemented by backends has a <code>gen_memcpy</code> method. It's used during codegen for function calls by <code>Caller::emit_copy_regs_to_buffer</code>, so I suspect it's well-covered by tests. On x86 and aarch64 it always calls the library <code>memcpy</code> function, but since it's backend-specific it could do something else. (I didn't check the other backends, but they're probably the same.) Making this code available to frontends like cg-clif sounds good to me.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-frontend/latest/cranelift_frontend/struct.FunctionBuilder.html\"><code>cranelift_frontend::FunctionBuilder</code></a> type has methods <code>call_mem{cmp,cpy,move,set}</code> for unconditionally emitting a library call. It also offers <code>emit_small_{memory_compare,memory_copy,memset}</code> to generate an unrolled CLIF loop for buffers smaller than a threshold, falling back to using <code>call_*</code> for larger buffers. I don't see any significant uses of any of these functions in Cranelift or Wasmtime, at any time in the git history. So they probably aren't well tuned and might not even work in general.</p>\n<p>I think you're right that the best way to expose these is with CLIF instructions, rather than <code>cranelift_frontend</code> methods. But I'm curious if anybody (like @cfallin?) has other suggestions.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This would then give us one central implementation we could use where needed (e.g. for struct args on the stack, as noted above) and that we could optimize well.</p>\n</blockquote>",
