A signaling NaN (SNaN) is distinguished from the corresponding quiet NaN (QNaN) by the leftmost fraction bit: zero for the SNaN and one for the QNaN. A special QNaN is supplied as the default result for an IEEE-invalid-operation exception; it has a plus sign and a leftmost fraction bit of one, with the remaining fraction bits being set to zeros.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ISA guarantees that the result of any floating-point instruction (except those only manipulating the sign bit) will always be a quiet NaN (if it is a NaN).   More specifically if the output is a NaN, it is either a copy of one of the input operands (possibly transformed from a signaling NaN to a quiet NaN), or else the default NaN described in the quote above (which corresponds to what WebAssembly calls the \"canonical NaN\").</p>\n<p>Given that behavior of the ISA, it seems unlikely that code generated by the wasmtime backend would ever be able to violate the WebAssembly NaN propagation rules on s390x (although I haven't explicitly verified all patterns).<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
