This is currently an intentional design decision but not because we think it's a good idea, moreso we couldn't think of a better idea at the time. </p>\n<p>One tricky part here is that Rust's type system cannot statically rule out all errors here. For example if the exported resource had type <code>T</code> then that type <code>T</code> is only valid for a single instantiation of a component. Each instantiation should get a unique type <code>T</code>, but that can't be reflected in Rust's type system.</p>\n<p>Not to say that prevents improving on the current situation of course. I think it'd be great if the <code>Resource&lt;T&gt;</code> approach could be fit in for more, albeit not ironclad, safety here.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If you have a resource A which exports a resource R, then if you instantiate the component twice producing A1 and A2 the R resource has a different type between A1/A2. Effectively the resource type has a bit of runtime state which indicates which component it came from. This is the part that I don't know how to reflect into the Rust type system statically.</p>\n<p>I'm hesitant to close this though because it would be possible to create a type representing R which ensures that you're using \"some R\" with \"some A\". There'd still be a runtime check that the two match but that's probably a better situation than today where there's no guard rails whatsoever at compile time.</p>\n</blockquote>",
