It should be kept alive in order to continue to be able to read the response body. However, the worker _is_ kept alive on <code>HostIncomingBody</code>. Arguably this the exact place where the task should be kept as once that type is dropped there's no longer a need to keep the worker around.</p>\n<p>The original motivation for this change is in a project where an actual HTTP request is not being made and the response are simply mocks. In this case, there's no need to start a worker task as there is no actual connection to keep alive. An alternative to this change would be to make the <code>worker</code> field an <code>Option</code> allowing those who don't need to keep a worker alive to simply set the field to <code>None</code>. However, a closer inspection of the code made it seem that this field is actually not necessary as the worker is being kept alive elsewhere. <br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
