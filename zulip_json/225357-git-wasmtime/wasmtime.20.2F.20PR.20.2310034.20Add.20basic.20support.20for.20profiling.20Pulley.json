This is partially achievable previously through the use of native profilers, but the downside of that approach is that you can find hot instructions but it's not clear in what context the hot instructions are being executed nor what functions are hot. The goal of this profiler is to show pulley bytecode and time spent in bytecode itself to better understand the shape of code around a hot instruction to identify new macro opcodes for example.</p>\n<p>The general structure of this new profiler is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There is a compile-time feature for Pulley which is off-by-default where, when enabled, Pulley will record its current program counter into an <code>AtomicUsize</code> before each instruction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When the CLI has <code>--profile pulley</code> Wasmtime will spawn a sampling thread in the same process which will periodically read from this <code>AtomicUsize</code> to record where the program is currently executing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Pulley profiler additionally records all bytecode through the use of the <code>ProfilingAgent</code> trait to ensure that the recording has access to all bytecode as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Samples are taken throughout the process and emitted to a <code>pulley-$pid.data</code> file. This file is then interpreted and printed by an \"example\" program <code>profiler-html.rs</code> in the <code>pulley/examples</code> directory.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The end result is that hot functions of Pulley bytecode can be seen and instructions are annotated with how frequently they were executed. This enables finding hot loops and understanding more about the whole loop, bytecodes that were selected, and such.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
