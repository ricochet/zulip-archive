This is the point I was not clear about.  On s390x, the value I get is in fact the native address, not a wasm linear memory address -- so if it <em>should</em> be a wasm address, there must be a platform bug somewhere.  I'll have a look.</p>\n<p>This also means that this PR is not the correct fix, so I'm closing it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
