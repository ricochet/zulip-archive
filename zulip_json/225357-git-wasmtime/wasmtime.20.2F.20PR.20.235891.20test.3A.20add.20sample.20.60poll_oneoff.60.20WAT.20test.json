Presumably the call works in other runtimes (i.e., WAMR) since it was upstreamed by a WAMR contributor. This tests checks that the use of <code>poll_oneoff</code> with some default (zero-filled?) parameters works in Wasmtime.</p>\n<p>[test]: <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-threads/blob/main/test/testsuite/wasi_threads_exit_main_wasi.wat\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-threads/blob/main/test/testsuite/wasi_threads_exit_main_wasi.wat</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
