This means that it assumes that hosts are always managing WIT interfaces in a semver-aare fashion meaning that semver-compatible upgrade exclusively adds functionality. This neatly fits into the idea of subtyping at the instance-level where if a binary built against 0.2.0 only requests a subset of functionality from a runtime that provides 0.2.1, that should work just fine.</p>\n<p>Specifically what this change does is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For all names inserted into a <code>Linker</code> there might also be a \"semver compatible name\" which is registered as well. For example <code>..@1.0.0</code> is also registered as <code>..@1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Semver-compatible names are only provided for versions without a prerelease and with either a nonzero major or minor version number.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When looking up an item in the linker if no exact match is found then if a semver-compatible-name is available for the lookup key then that's consulted as well.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This semantically means that if a components imports WASI 0.2.0 then a runtime which only provides WASI 0.2.1 will be able to instantiate the component. Furthermore if a component imports WASI 0.2.1 but only imports the subset of WASI that was available in 0.2.0 then it will be instantiable in a runtime that only supports 0.2.0.</p>\n<p>This implementation is intended to be a crucial part of the evolution to WASI to make it more seamless to upgrade WASI from both a host and guest perspective. This no longer requires everyone to upgrade to the same version all at the same time but instead decouples the upgrade schedules.</p>\n<p>Closes #7860</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
