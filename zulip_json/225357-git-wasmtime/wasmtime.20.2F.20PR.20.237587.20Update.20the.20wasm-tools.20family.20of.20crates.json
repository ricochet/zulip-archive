This update notably includes Nick's work on packed indices in the <code>wasmparser</code> crate for validation for the upcoming implementation of GC types. This meant that translation from <code>wasmparser</code> types to Wasmtime types now may work with a \"type id\" instead of just a type index which required plumbing not only Wasmtime's own type information but additionally <code>wasmparser</code>'s type information throughout translation.</p>\n<p>This required a fair bit of refactoring to get this working but no change in functionality is intended, only a different way of doing everything prior.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
