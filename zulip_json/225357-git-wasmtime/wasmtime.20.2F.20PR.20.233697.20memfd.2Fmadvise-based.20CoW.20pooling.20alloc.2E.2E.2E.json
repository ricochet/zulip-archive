The <code>memfd</code> mechanism<br>\nprovided by the Linux kernel allows us to create anonymous,<br>\nin-memory-only files that we can use for this mapping, so we can<br>\nconstruct the image contents on-the-fly then effectively create a CoW<br>\noverlay. Furthermore, and importantly, <code>madvise(MADV_DONTNEED, ...)</code><br>\nwill discard the CoW overlay, returning the mapping to its original<br>\nstate.</p>\n<p>By itself this is almost enough for a very fast<br>\ninstantiation-termination loop of the same image over and over,<br>\nwithout changing the address space mapping at all (which is<br>\nexpensive). The only missing bit is how to implement<br>\nheap <em>growth</em>. But here memfds can help us again: if we create another<br>\nanonymous file and map it where the extended parts of the heap would<br>\ngo, we can take advantage of the fact that a <code>mmap()</code> mapping can<br>\nbe <em>larger than the file itself</em>, with accesses beyond the end<br>\ngenerating a <code>SIGBUS</code>, and the fact that we can cheaply resize the<br>\nfile with <code>ftruncate</code>, even after a mapping exists. So we can map the<br>\n\"heap extension\" file once with the maximum memory-slot size and grow<br>\nthe memfd itself as <code>memory.grow</code> operations occur.</p>\n<p>The above CoW technique and heap-growth technique together allow us a<br>\nfastpath of <code>madvise()</code> and <code>ftruncate()</code> only when we re-instantiate<br>\nthe same module over and over, as long as we can reuse the same<br>\nslot. This fastpath avoids all whole-process address-space locks in<br>\nthe Linux kernel, which should mean it is highly scalable. It also<br>\navoids the cost of copying data on read, as the <code>uffd</code> heap backend<br>\ndoes when servicing pagefaults; the kernel's own optimized CoW<br>\nlogic (same as used by all file mmaps) is used instead.</p>\n<p>There are still a few loose ends in this PR, which I intend to tie up<br>\nbefore merging:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There is no <code>InstanceAllocationStrategy</code> yet that attempts to<br>\n  actually reuse instance slots; that should be added ASAP. For testing<br>\n  so far, I have just instantiated the same one module repeatedly (so<br>\n  reuse naturally occurs).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The guard-page strategy is slightly wrong; I need to implement the<br>\n  pre-heap guard region as well. This will be done by performing<br>\n  another mapping once, to reserve the whole address range, then<br>\n  mmap'ing the image and extension file on top at appropriate<br>\n  offsets (2GiB, 2GiB plus image size).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to Jan on Zulip (are you also @koute from #3691?) for the initial<br>\nidea/inspiration! This PR is meant to demonstrate my thoughts on how<br>\nto build the feature and spawn discussion; now that we see both approaches<br>\nhopefully we can work out a way to meet the needs of both of our use-cases.</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"#narrow/stream/206238-general/topic/Copy.20on.20write.20based.20instance.20reuse/near/266657772\">https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/206238-general/topic/Copy.20on.20write.20based.20instance.20reuse/near/266657772</a></p>\n</blockquote>",

FWIW my original thinking was that we already had the same mutable-access-to-slot thing going on implicitly, because the pooling and uffd allocators were making syscalls to mutate individual slots and relying on higher-level instance mutual exclusion for safety. The difference is just that we didn't have an actual Rust object embodying the slot and actions on it previously.</p>\n<p>In any case, the \"take ownership and return it\" pattern is much nicer; I feel better with this additional level of checking/safety. I ended up doing this with a mutex per slot, just for simplicity and to avoid gratuitous unsafe code and manual box&lt;-&gt;raw handling; that's probably acceptable overhead but I'm happy to refactor to actual atomic-exchange magic if not.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The invariant is that the memfd-construction code may reject creating a memfd for certain reasons, e.g. dynamically-placed segments, or out-of-bounds segments, or whatever else we need to reject. The MemFD mechanism may still handle the memory, and it may be initialized normally by writing into the anon-mmap memory; so really what we want is exactly \"are we using an already-prepared image\" and if not, we do the initializers. Added a better doc-comment here to explain.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think the safest answer to this is that if some mmap error occurs within the big mmap used by the pooling allocator for all memories, all bets are off and our only safe/secure option is to panic the process. Otherwise, unless we can carefully reason about why the remapping failed, we have a slot that is permanently unusable, so the system is degraded (slots die over time due to errors and we have no way of replacing them). And we have no way to return an error from an individual instantiation that means \"I not only failed allocation but blew up the allocator... please throw everything away and start over\". So, replaced with <code>.expect()</code>. If you have other ideas here though I'm very curious!</p>\n</blockquote>",

It starts to get into the territory of \"clean up uffd\", which feels out-of-scope for this PR.  My experience with trying to share too much logic as well is that sometimes it becomes hard to see through all the conditionals, and it can actually be simpler to maintain when the two disjoint approaches are kept separate. (See e.g. Cranelift backends and separate instruction lowering rules, vs. big mess of conditional logic. Not exactly the same, but similar in spirit.)</p>\n</blockquote>",

On thinking about this further:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If instantiation bails out after we've initialized the MemFdSlot (which can happen, e.g., if the resource-limiter says \"no\") then it's most idiomatic to just drop the slot object and let the pool create a new one later.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The most important thing -- the only thing I can think of that would absolutely require us to panic the process -- is that we don't let some other mmap ASLR its way into a gap in the pooling allocator's region if we leave a hole somewhere during instantiation. But we already avoid that, to prevent exactly that race condition; so even if the MemFdSlot fails, say, the second of 3 mmaps, we are still covering/reserving the whole range.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Given that, I think it's fine to drop the MemFdSlot at any point.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For an extra layer of {sanity, avoiding resource leaks e.g. keeping a memfd image alive, defense-in-depth-don't-map-more-than-we-need}, it is still nice to try to remove a stale mapping. I've written a <code>Drop</code> handler for <code>MemFdSlot</code> that does this in a best-effort way: it tries to map anonymous memory with <code>PROT_NONE</code> over the whole slot. It uses <code>NORESERVE</code> to make this more likely to succeed. But if it doesn't, the error is explicitly ignored (with a comment in the source to describe why safe): nothing is <em>supposed</em> to touch the slot anyway until the next <code>MemFdSlot</code> is created for it, and if mapping something into the slot fails again later for the new <code>MemFdSlot</code>, then it has the proper avenues to bubble up the error at that time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Does that seem reasonable?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Especially with this making such a drastric difference for the on-demand allocator it seems like using <code>memfd</code> is a no-brainer.</p>\n<p>To make this tweak as well as improve the portability here (right now if you enable <code>memfd</code> on Windows it'd probably just fail to compile) I think a few small changes are all that's needed.

At least if I'm reading your suggestion right, otherwise, we'd use the <code>MemFdSlot</code>'s <code>instantiate</code> logic to set up the actual CoW mapping then throw it away (without its dtor running) and rely on the implicit alignment of the <code>mprotect</code>-growth strategy between memfd and the usual dynamic memory.</p>\n<p>Re: syscalls on instantiate, we could indeed avoid one if we give the <code>MemFdSlot</code> a \"no fixed mapping\" mode, but then it takes responsibility for the pre-guard too, which complicates the pooling implementation somewhat.

We discussed this a bit in person as well, but to reiterate here I think it might be good to investigate a bit to figure out whether some functions below could grow an extra parameter or two instead of storing the state internally so it could be passed in by the \"source of truth\". </p>\n<p>I don't have a great idea though for whether this is possible, so I'll leave it up to your discretion about whether it ends up working out or not.</p>\n</blockquote>",
