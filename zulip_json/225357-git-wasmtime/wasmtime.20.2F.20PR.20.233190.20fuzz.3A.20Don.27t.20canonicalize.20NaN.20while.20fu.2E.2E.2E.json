Because Wasmtime was forcibly<br>\ncanonicalizing nan representations it created a mismatch in the results<br>\nof the interpreter and not. While permissible by the spec this hinders<br>\nfuzzing, so this commit attempts to address this to ensure that the spec<br>\ninterpreter produces the same NaN values as Wasmtime does (and vice<br>\nversa).</p>\n<p>NaN canonicalization was enabled for fuzzing in #1334 which tracks back<br>\nto #1332 and a desire for more determinism when fuzzing. I believe,<br>\nthough, that NaN bits are always deterministic within one machine,<br>\nthey're just \"nondeterministic\" across machines (although I think in<br>\npractice all cpus produce the same nan bits?) In any case I don't think<br>\nthat canonicalization is required for the fuzzers and disabling it helps<br>\nus align with what the spec interpreter is doing as well.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
