But practically speaking, SSE4.1 was introduced with Core 2 in 2007-ish and so is 14-15 years old at this point; if we have to require it when SIMD is turned on, at least for now, that's not the end of the world. (Almost all extant x86_64 chips will be newer than that -- we'd just be excluding the very early Athlon 64s and late-model Pentium 4s.)</p>\n<p>In any case, we should fail more nicely than an internal panic, as you say -- I can do some thinking about where the right place might be. Perhaps we can take an <code>isa_flags</code> with the verifier somehow; or perhaps we can define a \"supports all CLIF vector instructions\" helper function on the target that tells the producer whether the current settings are sufficient, and then check this against SIMD-enabled in the Wasmtime <code>cranelift</code> crate somewhere.</p>\n<p>I'll file an issue to track making SIMD \"SSE2-clean\" as well.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I suspect it might actually be easiest in Wasmtime to avoid having to keep everything in sync about individual instructions and at the Cranelift layer we could point existing panics to #3810 and for Wasmtime you'd get a first-class error on creating an <code>Engine</code> for a target which enables the simd proposal but doesn't support SSE 4.1.</p>\n</blockquote>",
