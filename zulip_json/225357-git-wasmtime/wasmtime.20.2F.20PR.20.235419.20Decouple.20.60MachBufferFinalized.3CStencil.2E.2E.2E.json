Instead it uses the function's base source location, which is the only piece used by the previous <code>apply_params</code> definition.</p>\n<p>This change allows other uses cases (e.g. Winch) to use an opaque, common concept, exposed outside of <code>cranelift-codegen</code> to get the finalized state of the machine buffer. This change implies that Winch will transitively know about the <code>Stencil</code> compilation phase, but the <code>Stencil</code> phase is not exposed to Winch.</p>\n<p>Other alternatives considered:</p>\n<p>Parametrizing <code>MachBufferFinzalized</code> in a way such that it allows specifying which compilation phase the caller is targetting. Such approach would require also parametrizing the <code>MachSrcLoc</code> definition. One of the main drawbacks of this approach is that it also requires changing how the <code>MachBuffer</code>'s <code>start_srcloc</code> works: for caller requesting a <code>Final</code> <code>MachBufferFinalized</code>, the <code>MachBuffer</code> will need to work in terms of <code>SourceLoc</code> rather than in <code>RelSourceLoc</code> terms. This approach doesn't necessarily present more advantages than the approach presented in this change, in which there's no need to make any fundamental changes and in which all the <code>cranelift-codegen</code> primitives are already exposed.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
