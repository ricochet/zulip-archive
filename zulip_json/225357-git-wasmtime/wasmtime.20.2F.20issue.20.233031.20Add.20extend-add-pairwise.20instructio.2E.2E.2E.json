I was planning to check/compare the lowering after comments from this first update, but do you see something specifically in case I miss it? I agree, the spec tests have shown to sometimes be cut-n-paste exercises that aren't thoughtful for the specific instructions. Not sure the best way to provide an answer key though for this lowering sequence. The lowering is not derived by me, but it's based on the discussion during instruction proposal and cross checked against what v8 appears to be doing, and finally of course spec tests which is there to catch errors though it is not fool-proof. </p>\n</blockquote>",
