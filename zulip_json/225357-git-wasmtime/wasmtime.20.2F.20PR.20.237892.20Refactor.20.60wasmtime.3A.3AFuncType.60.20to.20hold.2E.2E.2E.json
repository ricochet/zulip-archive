Most importantly, the refcount would be in the <code>RegisteredType</code> and accessible without the whole registry. Then dropping and cloning a <code>RegisteredType</code> wouldn't take a lock at all, it would just decrement its reference count. If the reference count reached zero, then we would either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Leave it at zero and not actualy remove the entry yet, instead relying on some subsequent operation on the registry doing a \"sweep\" for zero-refcount entries at some point in time, like the next time we insert into the registry. A bit hand-wavy, and does leave us with some floating garbage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have the <code>RegisteredType</code> hold a weak reference to the to whole type registry, and then only take the lock to remove the entry once the refcount reaches zero. Actual ref counting operations that don't reach zero still wouldn't need the lock. This does mean that we would add back another smart pointer though.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm happy to explore either option, or even something else, if you can think of anything.
