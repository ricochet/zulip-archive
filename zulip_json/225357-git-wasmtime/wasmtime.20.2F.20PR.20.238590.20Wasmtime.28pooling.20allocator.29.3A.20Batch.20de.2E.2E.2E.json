If the queue's length has reached the configured batch size, then we flush the queue by running all the decommits, and finally returning the memory/table/stack slots to their respective pools and free lists.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additionally, if allocating a new memory/table/stack fails because the free list is empty (aka we've reached the max concurrently-allocated limit for this entity) then we fall back to a slow path before propagating the error. This slow path flushes the decommit queue and then retries allocation, hoping that the queue flush reclaimed slots and made them available for this fallback allocation attempt. This involved defining a new <code>PoolConcurrencyLimitError</code> to match on, which is also exposed in the public embedder API.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also worth noting that we <em>always</em> use this new decommit queue now. To keep the existing behavior, where e.g. a memory's decommits happen immediately on deallocation, you can use a batch size of one. This effectively disables queuing, forcing all decommits to be flushed immediately.</p>\n<p>The default decommit batch size is one.</p>\n<p>This commit, with batch size of one, consistently gives me an increase on <code>wasmtime serve</code>'s requests-per-second versus its parent commit, as measured by <code>benches/wasmtime-serve-rps.sh</code>. I get ~39K RPS on this commit compared to ~35K RPS on the parent commit. This is quite puzzling to me. I was expecting no change, and hoping there wouldn't be a regression. I was not expecting a speed up.

The duplication in the three deallocate methods in <code>pooling.rs</code> is pretty subtle and feels sort of hard to get right. It also has the subtelty of the <code>Mutex&lt;DeallocationQueue&gt;</code> is held across function calls, such as this one, and it's getting to the point where it's easy to get into issues of lock ordering issues or deadlocks. For example in <code>deallocate_fiber_stack</code> the deallocation queue lock may be held across <code>self.stacks.deallocate</code> which internally acquires a different lock.</p>\n<p>This leads me to a different way to model this which might be a bit less error-prone. This <code>decommit</code> argument could be replaced by a structure with <code>SmallVec</code>s inside of it where it's pushed onto. Once this step has completed there's a general method for \"clear out this thing with small vectors or, if empty, do the deallocation immediately\" or something like that. That would keep the critical section as small as possible while I think also making it a bit clearer how to reuse/shape code using it perhaps?</p>\n</blockquote>",
