We're still iterating on that and will PR those changes separately. We also have a fork of wit-bindgen with a new \"wildcards\" test to verify everything works end-to-end: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/compare/main...dicej:wit-templates\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/compare/main...dicej:wit-templates</a>. I'll PR that last once everything else is stable.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
