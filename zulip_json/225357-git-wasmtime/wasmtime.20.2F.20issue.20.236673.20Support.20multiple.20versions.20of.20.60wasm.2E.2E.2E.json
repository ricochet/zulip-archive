If you've got wasmtime-1 and wasmtime-2 both on the stack then if one faults and the others' handler ends up running first the handler should end up determining that the signal should not be caught and defer to the next handler. This is more-or-less falling out of the \"we don't catch signals not caused by wasm\" and the signals from wasmtime-1 appear like non-wasm signals to wasmtime-2 because the faulting address won't be in any known region.</p>\n<p>I do agree though it'd be good to document this!

One of the issues with this is that if we ever update a dependency then we'll get <code>cargo deny</code> errors about duplicate dependencies since the old version of wasmtime will still have the old dependency -- this can sort of already be seen with <code>cargo deny</code> failing in CI on this PR. This is probably fixable, but I feel like that would be somewhat the tip of the iceberg in this case.</p>\n<p>Additionally Chris's suggestion would be a good way to go but I dont think we can do that because it'd use the same copy of <code>wasmtime-runtime</code>-the-compiled-rlib which means that everything is using one TLS slot. While this shouldn't cause issues in theory it does mean that it's not a \"perfect\" emulation of multiple versions and may accidentally miss something crucial.</p>\n<p>FWIW we have had integration issues along the lines of signal handlers in the past, for example with breakpoint on macOS and not wanting to use mach exception ports but instead use unix signals. Now that I type this out I think a multi-version wasmtime on macOS may not work because there's two threads handling exceptions and it's a race as to which gets a message and there's no delegate-to-the-next handler ability like there is with signals (or at least not implemented I think,  I'm not expert on mach)</p>\n<p>So it may perhaps be best to instead fix issues on an issue-by-issue basis instead of declaring \"wasmtime multi-version works great\".

Oddly enough none of this is necessary technically if all you're doing is compiling modules since these are all \"runtime bits\" as opposed to compiler bits.
