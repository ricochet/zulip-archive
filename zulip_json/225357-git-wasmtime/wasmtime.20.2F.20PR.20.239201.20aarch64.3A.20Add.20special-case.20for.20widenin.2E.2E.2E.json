Notably zero and sign-extended values which are multiplied to produce a 128-bit result can skip some of the arithmetic of the fully general 128-bit lowering.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
