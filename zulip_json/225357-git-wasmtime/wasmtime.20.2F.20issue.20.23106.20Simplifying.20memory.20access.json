A lot has happened in the last 4 years that may help answer the allocation management question! </p>\n<p>As far as the API goes, are you still interested in pages/bytes types or does the <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html#method.read\">Memory API as it stands today</a> work well enough to resolve the issue?</p>\n</blockquote>",
