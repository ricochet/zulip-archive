Note that this is not the Wasmtime-generated DWARF but rather the native wasm DWARF itself used in backtraces.</p>\n<p>Previously the wasm dwarf was inserted into sections <code>.*.wasm</code> where <code>*</code> was <code>debug_info</code>, <code>debug_str</code>, etc -- one per <code>gimli::SectionId</code> as found in the original wasm module. This does not work with components, however, where modules did not correctly separate their debug information into separate sections or otherwise disambiguate. The fix in this commit is to instead smash all the debug information together into one large section and store offsets into that giant section. This is similar to the <code>name</code>-section scraping or the trap metadata section where one section contains all the data for all the modules in a component.</p>\n<p>This simplifies the object file parsing by only looking for one section name and doesn't add all that much complexity to serializing and looking up dwarf information as well.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
