Tests are configured differently than before using Wasmtime CLI flags rather than a custom TOML-based configuration scheme. Otherwise though the same shape of tests is supported.</p>\n<p>This commit migrates a small handful of tests as a showcase and bulk migration is left for a follow-up.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
