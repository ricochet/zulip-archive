A few thoughts below. I think there may be some aspect of subjective taste here; but I'm not a huge fan of very large iterator chain expressions, because they take a lot of \"mental type-inference\" to understand intermediate steps and how the chain works, and they're harder to modify and maintain over time. They're not a huge amount <em>worse</em> than explicit for-loops, but here they don't really seem better either; so I'm not sure I see the \"simplification\" aspect. Happy to hear your thoughts though.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Also would a collect be most appropriate here - used extend to ensure exact same semantics as before with push, but the <code>while let should</code> drain  <code>stack</code> and so it is being extended from empty each time (in which case collect may make this more clear)</p>\n</blockquote>",
