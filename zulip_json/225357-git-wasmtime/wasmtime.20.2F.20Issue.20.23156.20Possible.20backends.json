I did see a comment in the README about supporting interpreters and that would be nice for some situations, if we could swap that out so easily.</p>\n<p>However, looking into the compiler strategies, it seems an enum of cranelift or light beam.</p>\n<p>Am I correct that there is no wasm interpreter that works with wasmtime? And is there any tracking issue (besides this) with any plans? I would also be interested in wasmi support</p>\n</blockquote>",
