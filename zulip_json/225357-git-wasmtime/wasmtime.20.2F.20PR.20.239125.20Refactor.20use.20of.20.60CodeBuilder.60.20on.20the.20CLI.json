This will in theory help out in the future if more debug-related options are added to <code>CodeBuilder</code> for example. This refactoring required some changes to <code>CodeBuilder</code> to be able to support a query about whether the internal bytes were a component or a module. The text format is now converted to binary immediately when supplied rather than during the compilation phase. This in turn required some API changes to make the selection of supporting the text format a compile-time choice of method rather than a runtime value.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
