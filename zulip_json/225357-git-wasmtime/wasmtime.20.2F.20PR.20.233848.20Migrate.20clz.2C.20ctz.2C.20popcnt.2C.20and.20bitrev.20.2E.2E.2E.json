The bit-twiddling algorithms are, at least to my eye, a bit more legible in this form, but I'm happy to add more comments here if desired since we're making a pass over everything anyway.</p>\n<p>Also updated a few stray places I had missed earlier where we can use implicit conversions (the <code>def_inst</code> removals).</p>\n</blockquote>",
