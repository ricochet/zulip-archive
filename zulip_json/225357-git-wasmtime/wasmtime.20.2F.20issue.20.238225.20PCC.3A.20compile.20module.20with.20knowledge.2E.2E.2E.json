With our bounds-checking code and default setting of a 2GiB guard region, we handle this today with a dynamic bounds-check. PCC currently cannot handle dynamic bounds-checks. So if we want to (i) deploy PCC in our default configuration, and (ii) correctly handle all legal Wasm inputs, we need to find a way to check such instructions.</p>\n<p>It occurs to me that if our guard region is large enough, any load/store with an offset larger than the guard region will also have a minimum address that is larger than the biggest possible memory in most \"reasonable\" production configurations. If we can guarantee that, and compile with that assumption, we can statically compile a <code>i32.load offset=9bazillion</code> instruction into a trap (with a <code>HeapOutOfBounds</code> trap code so it is semantically unchanged to observers). This would allow PCC to check the result as well.</p>\n<p>I'd like to file the issue first to get opinions: would it be reasonable to have a <code>maximum_memory_size</code> configuration option that bounds <em>all</em> memories, such that it is an error to grow larger than that, and then use this during compilation to handle the above case? And then set it so that it is at (or ever so slightly smaller than, by the maximum load/store width) the default guard-region size, so we get the nice property that our default configuration never generates dynamic bounds checks?</p>\n</blockquote>",

In particular I note <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/8052bb9e3b792503b225f2a5b2ba3bc023bff462/cranelift/wasm/src/code_translator/bounds_checks.rs#L377-L387\">this case</a> in the seven bounds-check cases, which triggers for static memories where the guard is otherwise not large enough. There is the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/8052bb9e3b792503b225f2a5b2ba3bc023bff462/cranelift/wasm/src/code_translator/bounds_checks.rs#L308-L319\">case here</a> that statically becomes a trap, but that's only if the offset and size exceed the <em>memory size</em> bound, and that bound needs to be 4GiB to elide bounds checks otherwise; so a 3GiB offset doesn't fit. That's precisely the gap I want to reify here: a separate \"actual maximum size\" configuration that is distinct from \"virtual memory size\".</p>\n</blockquote>",

I can confirm that with <code>-O static-memory-guard-size=$((1&lt;&lt;32))</code> the above test case works as-is today. I can also confirm that if the above offset is changed to <code>$((1&lt;&lt;32)) - 4</code> then it still works, but offsets larger than that actually work with the default 2G region. </p>\n<p>I think I was confusing a different optimization we have where when access size + offset is &gt;4G we compile a static trap, but you're right that the maximum size of memory isn't taken into account. That's something we should add! Not that it would \"truly\" fix this test case though since most memories don't have an upper bound in the real world.</p>\n<p>Also sorry for \"larger than memory size\" I should have clarified I meant the indexing type. The index type here is a 32-bit integer so the offset <code>1&lt;&lt;32</code> is rejected by wasm validation. My point being that for 32-bit linear memories we statically know all linear memory offsets are less than <code>1&lt;&lt;32</code>, so we are guaranteed that everything is a 33-bit address and no more.</p>\n<p>Thinking a bit more on this, I think we could perhaps do two different things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With PCC recommend a 4G guard region. Whether or not that's suitable for virtual memory overheads I think will be situation-specific. For example with mpk there's no issue as you could probably still get more instances today than already. Additionally the 2G guard region today is somewhat arbitrarily the maximum signed distance to go, but there's no reason (pending bugs) that we couldn't switch the default to a 1G or 512M guard region which would already be a significant improvement over today. Mostly I don't think 4G guards should be immediately discarded, but instead weigh the cost with other factors.</li>\n<li>I don't really know PCC at all, but is it possible to codegen a different pattern for bounds-checked offsets? For example with a 2G guard region the risk is that the access lies outside the guard region, but we could perform manual arithmetic with a manual trap if the access is &gt;=6G and then perform a normal trapping load if it's &lt;= 6G. I'd hope that in this situation it'd look to PCC like the address was a normal load, but I don't know enough about PCC to know if this is possible.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

For example if an embedder doesn't allow more than 128MB of linear memory, the static memory bound should be set to 128MB, or 2048 pages. The static memory bound will turn overly-large offsets into traps, and for smaller offsets, the 4GB of guard pages will ensure that any <code>i32</code> index doesn't need a bounds-check.</p>\n<p>We could also just trap when the offset is too large for any memory which is declared with a maximum limit, whether it's static or dynamic. If the static memory bound is used as an implied maximum limit when the module doesn't declare one, then that would remove the need for the current \"case 1\" for static memories. However that doesn't change that we need 4GB of guard pages to avoid bounds-checks when the offset is smaller.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The bit that is not PCC-able is exactly the dynamic bounds check -- the symbolic reasoning to match up the compare to the select breaks when opts merge more than one access together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'd still like to understand this better.

The point of the test case is to show that dynamic bounds checks still occur; it says nothing about PCC, is not designed to be tested with PCC, has never even heard of PCC, etc etc.</p>\n<p>The underlying cause for all of this is that, yes, when optimizations run, multiple dynamic checks get merged together (the same base address is used for multiple accesses because of GVN, and the facts merge), and when symbolic facts merge, we either need to merge symbolic worlds (unscalable) or a consistent merging strategy; and separately, sometimes optimizations around constant addresses are smart and there's no stable <em>thing</em> with an identity to hang the comparison reasoning off if, because constants get absorbed directly into instructions or folded away.</p>\n<p>I haven't shown any test case that demonstrates <em>that</em>, because it's deep in fuzzbugs and I really don't have the bandwidth to write it up properly (sorry). You're of course welcome to dig into it; the <code>pcc_memory</code> integration test will trigger the issue if you enable bounds-checking configurations. But it's a deep research question and IMHO the right course is to save it for later (and I will not be able to help further right now).</p>\n<p>The point of all this is that we think we can do PCC if we only have implicit (virtual memory)-based bounds checking. So I pushed a recursion level and instantiated a subproblem: let's create a mode where codegen <em>never</em> does explicit bounds checks. Then we don't have to worry about the above. That's this specific issue, and the test case above demonstrates <em>that</em>: we still get dynamic bounds checks even in the default configuration (and even under opts if you replace my silly const-0 with an arg input).

With our bounds-checking code and default setting of a 2GiB guard region, we handle this today with a dynamic bounds-check. PCC currently cannot handle dynamic bounds-checks. So if we want to (i) deploy PCC in our default configuration, and (ii) correctly handle all legal Wasm inputs, we need to find a way to check such instructions.</p>\n<p>It occurs to me that if our guard region is large enough, any load/store with an offset larger than the guard region will also have a minimum address that is larger than the biggest possible memory in most \"reasonable\" production configurations. If we can guarantee that, and compile with that assumption, we can statically compile a <code>i32.load offset=9bazillion</code> instruction into a trap (with a <code>HeapOutOfBounds</code> trap code so it is semantically unchanged to observers). This would allow PCC to check the result as well.</p>\n<p>I'd like to file the issue first to get opinions: would it be reasonable to have a <code>maximum_memory_size</code> configuration option that bounds <em>all</em> memories, such that it is an error to grow larger than that, and then use this during compilation to handle the above case? And then set it so that it is at (or ever so slightly smaller than, by the maximum load/store width) the default guard-region size, so we get the nice property that our default configuration never generates dynamic bounds checks?</p>\n</blockquote>",
