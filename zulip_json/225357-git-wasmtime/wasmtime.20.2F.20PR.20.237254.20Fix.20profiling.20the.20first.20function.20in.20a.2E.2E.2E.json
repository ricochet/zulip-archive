This check is relatively dated at this point and I think I originally added it in error (and/or it was copied from somewhere else), so this commit removes it.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
