This commit instead refactors the<br>\ntraits to instead work with an <code>Options</code> type where the <code>Options</code> type<br>\ncan be manufactured from thin air out of the arguments passed to the<br>\ncomponent host trampolines.</p>\n<p>This new <code>Options</code> type is also suitable for storing in <code>WasmStr</code> and<br>\n<code>WasmList</code> to continue to be used to refer back to memory after<br>\nthese lifted values have been given back to the embedder.</p>\n<p>Overall this should largely just be shuffling code around and renaming<br>\n<code>func: &amp;Func</code> to <code>options: &amp;Options</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
