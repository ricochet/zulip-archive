(Wasmtime doesn't yet have an interpreter mode but it may in the future.)</p>\n<p>Regarding the Cranelift-based JIT: @uweigand has actually been working on s390x support for a while now; my understanding is that there is a backend that works but it is still in progress and has not yet been made public / merged. CI is an issue: @uweigand also offered access to s390x machines via IBM but GitHub's CI runner (used to run CI on one's own machines) is a .NET program, apparently, and .NET itself has not been ported to s390x. In principle we could merge something without CI and support it on a \"it will keep compiling\" best-effort basis, though.</p>\n<p>Anyway -- @uweigand, do you have any recent updates on this?</p>\n</blockquote>",

While I've been a bit sidetracked with other projects recently, I hope we can get this merged in the medium term to at least benefit from ongoing compile testing.  Ideally, we'd also get the GitHub CI runner going (actually, porting .NET is one of those projects I've been spending my time on recently :-)), but that'll still take some time.</p>\n</blockquote>",
