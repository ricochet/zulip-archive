Wasmtime's implementation of WASI is only usable through <code>wasmtime.h</code> APIs, not through the <code>wasm.h</code> APIs. This was a deliberate decision from RFC 11.</p>\n<p>The <code>wasm.h</code> header doesn't support a number of features that Wasmtime wants to support (even in its C API) such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WASI (as you've discovered)</li>\n<li>SIMD support (the <code>v128</code> type)</li>\n<li>Module linking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These features are implemented today in Wasmtime and supported via the C API (through <code>wasmtime.h</code>), and we do not want to try to retrofit all of these options onto the existing <code>wasm.h</code>.</p>\n<p>Could you describe a bit more about your use case perhaps, though?

It hasn't seen much activity in quite some time now. Regardless, though, Wasmtime intends to help evolve that proposal and contribute to it, but at this time we are also not in charge of shepherding it so we can only try to affect its evolution when it gets some more activity. </p>\n<p>It is the intention of Wasmtime to continue to implement the upstream C API, however. Unfortunately though due to the lack of activity on the upstream C API there's not a ton of flexibility with the API and it's particularly restrictive for our implementation. Consequently while we support the API with a shim we recommend using Wasmtime's custom API instead since that's where we're maintaining extended functionality like WASI.</p>\n<p>If WASI gets an official embedding C API then we would also implement that, but at this time there is no such API.</p>\n<p>Sorry, though, to answer your question you're correct in that WASI with Wasmtime's C API today cannot be used exclusively with the <code>wasm.h</code> header file.</p>\n<p>Basically the tl;dr; is we want to follow standards, but there's very few standards in this space. For what standard there is it's pretty inactive and relatively incomplete. At this time we implement existing standards but only in a compatibility fashion, and we give the full functionality with our own API otherwise.</p>\n</blockquote>",
