If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;<br>\nI observed an assertion failure of <code>assertion failed: self.sp_offset == locals_size</code> in the <code>epilogue</code> function when there's a float on the value stack and a spill is triggered when using Winch. When we spill, we use the scratch register which results in 8 bytes being allocated on the stack and when we pop the float to return that value, we only free 4 bytes because it's a float. This changes the spilling behaviour to use a floating point scratch register instead so we increment the stack by the same amount we will decrement it by when popping the function result.</p>\n</blockquote>",
