The actual implementation of <code>Store&lt;T&gt;</code><br>\nhas evolved from the original implementation to the point where some of<br>\nthe aspects of how things are structured no longer makes sense. There's<br>\nalso always been a lot of unnecessary gymnastics when trying to get<br>\naccess to various store pieces depending on where you are in <code>wasmtime</code>.</p>\n<p>This refactoring aims to simplify all this and make the internals much<br>\neasier to read/write. The following changes were made:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>StoreOpaque&lt;'_&gt;</code> type is deleted, along with the <code>opaque()</code><br>\n  method.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>StoreInnermost</code> type was renamed to <code>StoreOpaque</code>.<br>\n<code>StoreOpaque&lt;'_&gt;</code> is dead. Long live <code>StoreOpaque</code>. This renaming<br>\n  and a few small tweaks means that this type now suffices for all<br>\n  consumers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>AsContextMut</code> and <code>AsContext</code> traits are now implemented for<br>\n<code>StoreInner&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes, while subtly small, help clean up a lot of the internals<br>\nof <code>wasmtime</code>. There's a lot less verbose <code>&amp;mut\nstore.as_context_mut().opaque()</code> now. Additionally many methods can<br>\nsimply start with <code>let store = store.as_context_mut().0;</code> and use things<br>\ninternally. One of the nicer aspects of using references directly is<br>\nthat the compiler automatically reborrows references as necessary<br>\nmeaning there's lots of less manual reborrowing.</p>\n<p>The main motivation for this change was actually somewhat roundabout<br>\nwhere I found that when <code>StoreOpaque&lt;'_&gt;</code> was being captured in closures<br>\nand iterators it's 3 pointers wide which is a lot of data to move<br>\naround. Now things capture over <code>&amp;mut StoreOpaque</code> which is just one<br>\nnice and small pointer to move around. In any case though I've long<br>\nwanted to revisit the design of these internals to improve the<br>\nergonomics. It's not expected that this change alone will really have<br>\nall that much impact on the performance of <code>wasmtime</code>.</p>\n<p>Finally a doc comment was added to <code>store.rs</code> to try to explain all the<br>\n<code>Store</code>-related types since there are a nontrivial amount.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
