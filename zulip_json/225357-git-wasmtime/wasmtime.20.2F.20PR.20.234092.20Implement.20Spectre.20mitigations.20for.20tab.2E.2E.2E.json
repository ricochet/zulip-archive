Specifically, we guard against errant<br>\naccesses on the misspeculated path beyond the bounds-check conditional<br>\nbranch by adding a conditional move that is also dependent on the<br>\nbounds-check condition. This data dependency on the condition is not<br>\nspeculated and thus will always pick the \"safe\" value (in the heap case,<br>\na NULL address) on the misspeculated path, until the pipeline flushes<br>\nand recovers onto the correct path.</p>\n<p>This PR uses the same technique both for table accesses -- used to<br>\nimplement Wasm tables -- and for jumptables, used to implement Wasm<br>\n<code>br_table</code> instructions.</p>\n<p>In the case of Wasm tables, the cmove picks the table base address on<br>\nthe misspeculated path. This is equivalent to reading the first table<br>\nentry. This prevents loads of arbitrary data addresses on the<br>\nmisspeculated path.</p>\n<p>In the case of <code>br_table</code>, the cmove picks index 0 on the misspeculated<br>\npath. This is safer than allowing a branch to an address loaded from an<br>\nindex under misspeculation (i.e., it preserves control-flow integrity<br>\neven under misspeculation).</p>\n<p>The table mitigation is controlled by a Cranelift setting, on by<br>\ndefault. The br_table mitigation is always on, because it is part of the<br>\nsingle lowering pseudoinstruction. In both cases, the impact should be<br>\nminimal: a single extra cmove in a (relatively) rarely-used operation.</p>\n<p>The table mitigation is architecture-independent (happens during<br>\nlegalization); the br_table mitigation has been implemented for both x64<br>\nand aarch64. (I don't know enough about s390x to implement this<br>\nconfidently there, but would happily review a PR to do the same on that<br>\nplatform.)</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
