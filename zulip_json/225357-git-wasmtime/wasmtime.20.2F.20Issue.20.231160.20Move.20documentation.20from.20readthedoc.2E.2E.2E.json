At some point (can't remember where), I saw a discussion about moving the documentation to <a href=\"https://docs.rs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.rs\">https://docs.rs</a> exclusively. I think this would be a good idea in order to keep documentation up to date, since <a href=\"https://cranelift.readthedocs.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://cranelift.readthedocs.io\">https://cranelift.readthedocs.io</a> seems to have some gaps.</p>\n<h4>What is the value of adding this in Cranelift?</h4>\n<p>Documentation should be complete and ideally in one place.</p>\n<h4>Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or algorithms to use?</h4>\n<p>I believe we would have to distribute the contents of the <code>docs</code> directory to Rust files such as <code>cranelift-umbrella/src/lib.rs</code> (and remove the <code>sphinx</code> documentation in <code>README.md</code>). Also, as noted in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1264\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1264\">bytecodealliance/cranelift#1264</a>, it occurred to me that perhaps we would also like to update the docs badge to something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>[![Documentation Status](https://docs.rs/cranelift/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/cranelift)\n````\n[![Documentation Status](https://docs.rs/cranelift/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/cranelift)\n\n~~~\n</pre></div>\n\n\n</blockquote>",
