This still spawns a rayon thread though and can offload work to it, so this instead explicitly uses <code>wasmtime::Config</code> to disable parallel compilation. This should ensure that <code>rayon</code> doesn't get used at runtime, as desired, and additionally avoids spawning threads or offloading work onto a thread.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
