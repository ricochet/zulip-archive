Additionally, this adds a <code>gpr_to_xmm</code> function to the x64 backend to allow loading a constant and moving it to an xmm register. It also reserves <code>xmm15</code> as the scratch xmm register.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

This is something minor, but I'm trying to keep the <code>regalloc2</code> usage contained in a single place as much possible because the idea is to eventually share the register definitions between <code>regalloc2</code> and Winch instead of pulling the entire regalloc2 crate into Winch. These are long term plans though, but my hope is that having them in a single place, will make it easier to refactor once the time comes. </p>\n</blockquote>",
