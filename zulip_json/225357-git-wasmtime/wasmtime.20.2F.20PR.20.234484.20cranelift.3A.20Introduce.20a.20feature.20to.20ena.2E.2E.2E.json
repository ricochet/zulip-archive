If downstream users set their <code>log::max_level</code> to <code>Trace</code>, they would pay the cost for the logging infrastructure, even if the logger eventually decides to throw away the logs' contents, so it's better overall to not call into the logging infra at all.</li>\n<li>Second commit: previously disassembly was emitted if explicitly enabled (only in testing setups), or when the log level was debug or more. I suppose this was done during hacking on regalloc2 (as the commit introducing this change is the switch to regalloc2), and never reverted, so I've done that here. We could add a cranelift flag to be able to request that at runtime with the CLI, if needs be.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this change and those from other PRs, there's no more meaningful difference between a Wasmtime embedding setting the log's max level to trace or above.</p>\n</blockquote>",
