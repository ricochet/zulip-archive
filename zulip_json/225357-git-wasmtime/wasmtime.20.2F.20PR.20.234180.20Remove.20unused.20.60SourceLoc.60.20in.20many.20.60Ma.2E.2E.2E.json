I thought it would be needed by the Spidermonkey backend, but it's a bit outdated (using a CL version predating the Mach stuff). I've received confirmation from the Spidermonkey folks that they're fine investigating the work necessary to adjust to these changes, so opening this PR as an incremental step towards #4155.</p>\n</blockquote>",
