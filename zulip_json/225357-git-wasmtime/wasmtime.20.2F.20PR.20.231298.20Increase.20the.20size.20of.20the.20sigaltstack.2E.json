Install bigger sigaltstack stacks so that we have enough<br>\nspace.</p>\n<p>cc #900. The code here is a sketch of a possible<br>\nalternative. Advantages of this approach include not needing extra<br>\nprologue checks, not disabling the Rust stack overflow message, and<br>\nensuring that we always have a guard page.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
