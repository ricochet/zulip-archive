The stack and the data segment must also not overlap. I'm not sure if lld (the linker used by rustc for wasm) supports this. Emscripten does support it afaik when linking as dynamic libraries, but afaik lld doesn't support dynamic libraries on wasm.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This is implemented and available for use in Wasmtime. Creating a module that imports memory to simultaneously share with others, however, is not a trivial operation to do. There is no standard at this time for such a set of modules, and everything must be manually set up (which may be unlikely to be what you're looking for).</p>\n<p>Given though that Wasmtime implements everything necessary here and the remaining part of the question is a toolchain issue I'm going to close this since I don't think there's an issue for Wasmtime to handle here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
