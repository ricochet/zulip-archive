The motivating use case for this feature was <code>curl | wasmtime</code>, where the provided code really shouldn't be trusted.</li>\n<li>I think the details of which formats are supported should be fully encapsulated in the wasmtime crate, not duplicated in the CLI. Somebody (I forget who) suggested that the CLI should serve as an example of how to use the library, and I like that as a guiding principle here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think it'd be reasonable to declare that <code>--allow-precompiled</code> is incompatible with reading from stdin. With #5342, if stdin happens to be mmap-able because e.g. it's redirected from a file on Unix, then <code>--allow-precompiled</code> works, but I think it's okay to lose that \"feature\".</p>\n<p>So I'd prefer to reject that combination while validating arguments, and replace this block with:</p>\n<p><div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"suggestion\"><pre><span></span><code>                Module::new(linker.engine(), &amp;module)?\n</code></pre></div><br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

It's already opt-in behavior which I would imagine suitably covers any misuse issues. It surely would be bad to <code>curl | wasmtime --allow-precompiled</code> but I don't feel like it's our place to prevent that if someone really wanted to.</p>\n<p>As for the ELF detection, I don't mind moving it into the crate one way or another.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I guess I don't have a strong argument for preferring to disallow <code>--allow-precompiled</code> when reading from stdin on general principle.</p>\n<p>I do think the API design is a little fiddly if you want to allow that case though. My suggestion, which we adopted in #5342, had been to combine \"is this safe to mmap\" with \"is this safe to blindly execute as native code\", so the same <code>Module::from_trusted_file</code> API is used to mean both things. We could introduce, I dunno, <code>Module::from_trusted_bytes</code> or something to mean only \"safe to execute\"?</p>\n</blockquote>",
