The <code>Trap</code> structure is now a reason plus backtrace,<br>\nand the old <code>Trap</code> enum is mostly in <code>TrapReason</code> now. Additionally all<br>\n<code>Trap</code>-returning methods of <code>wasmtime_runtime</code> are changed to returning<br>\na <code>TrapCode</code> to indicate that they never capture a backtrace. Finally<br>\nthe <code>UnwindReason</code> internally now no longer duplicates the trap reasons,<br>\ninstead only having two variants of \"panic\" and \"trap\".</p>\n<p>The motivation for this commit is mostly just cleaning up trap internals<br>\nand removing the need for methods like<br>\n<code>wasmtime_runtime::Trap::insert_backtrace</code> to leave it only happening at<br>\nthe <code>wasmtime</code> layer.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
