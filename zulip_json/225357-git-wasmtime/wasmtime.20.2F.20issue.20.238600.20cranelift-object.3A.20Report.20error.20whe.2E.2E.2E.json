This also allows finding the name of the exact symbol that is at fault.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>This check can be done in the <code>finish</code> method.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>TODO: What are the alternative implementation approaches or alternative ways to<br>\nsolve the problem that this feature would solve? How do these alternatives<br>\ncompare to this proposal?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
