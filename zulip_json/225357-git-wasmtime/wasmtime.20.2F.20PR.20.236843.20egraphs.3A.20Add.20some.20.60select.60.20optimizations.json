In many cases we can avoid them since <code>select</code> supports pretty much any input type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When we have <code>(select c (iconst -1) (iconst 0))</code> we can remove the <code>select</code> if we know that the controlling value already generates a <code>-1</code> or <code>0</code>. I've implemented this for <code>icmp</code> and <code>fcmp</code><br>\n    * I wanted to add a base rule that would turn any other value into <code>bmask</code>, but it ended up messing with the <code>icmp</code> and <code>fcmp</code> rules, and I'm not sure how to deal with that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete consecutive <code>bmask</code>'s</p>\n</li>\n<li>Delete consecutive <code>bswap</code>'s</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've ran sightglass on these and it shows no difference. I've also fuzzed this change for a couple of hours and it also didn't trigger anything.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In my PR I noticed that <code>ineg</code> and <code>bmask</code> also preserve whether the argument is non-zero and can be eliminated inside select for the same reason.</p>\n<p>That's not true of <code>ireduce</code>, but you can use a different rule there: I believe it's safe to eliminate either <code>ireduce</code> or <code>sextend</code> (but not <code>uextend</code>) when they're applied to <code>bmask</code>. At least according to <code>bmask</code>'s definition, it can produce any integer type regardless of the type of its argument. Hopefully the backends implement that faithfully.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Then all the other rules we're discussing that match <code>bmask</code> can apply.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if it's useful, but I guess the other pattern we could extract from these rules is that when <code>bmask</code> is applied to either <code>icmp</code> or <code>fcmp</code>, it's a no-op if the result type is <code>I8</code>, or it's equivalent to <code>sextend</code> for any wider scalar type.</p>\n<p>I always forget that <code>icmp</code> and <code>fcmp</code> return <code>I8</code> when given any width of scalar. That's kinda weird and had me very confused about these rules. Maybe we should change that someday.</p>\n<p>There's a minor efficiency improvement if you reuse unchanged nodes from the input. For example, bind the <code>fcmp</code> to a name using an at-pattern (<code>cmp @ (fcmp fty cc x y)</code>) and then use that name instead of the full pattern on the right-hand side. This avoids having to look up the original node in the GVN map, since we already have the node ID from doing the pattern match. In theory, ISLE could do this transformation automatically, as long as we guarantee that the extractor and constructor for the same term are always inverses of each other.</p>\n</blockquote>",
