This technically should have been done in #9336 when wasm-tools was updated to auto-try to enable this proposal by default, but alas I am not a human fuzzer so I waited until OSS-Fuzz found it.</p>\n<p>cc @conrad-watt we haven't updated our submodule in quite some time, but I figured this was a good a time as any to ask - have there been any major updates on your spec interpreter fork in the past year or so? If not no worries, but if so we can try to update too!</p>\n</blockquote>",
