However, the CI did not alert me about this. It is confusing to see a crate configuration in the <code>supply-chain</code> that we no longer depend on. Therefore, I added a step in the CI to check whether we need to execute the prune command.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't think we'll want to do this though because one workflow for adding vets needed for contributors is for maintainers to send a PR which contains the vet entries which are then used by a contributor's later PR. That means that vet entries might be added without anything in-tree using them but they're required for a soon-to-land PR. Another option is to push commits to contributors' PRs but that's not currently required at this time.</p>\n</blockquote>",
