Relocations are the only part of the file which we actually modify today, so some code will be added to tempoarily change the text section to read/write if relocations need to be applied. With <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3254\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3254</a>, though, that should be rare. I don't actually know if it's possible for the new backend to generate any other relocations after we remove those for <code>call</code> instructions.</p>\n</blockquote>",
