The clobbered register contained the value: <code>index + offset + access_size</code>, which resulting in an incorrect access and consequently in an incorrect <code>HeapOutOfBounds</code> trap.</p>\n<p>This bug is only reproducible when modifying Wasmtime's memory settings, forcing the heap to be treated as <code>Dynamic</code>.</p>\n<p>Currently in Winch there's no easy way to have specific Wasmtime configurations, so having a filetests for this case is not straightforward. I've opted to add an integration test, in which it's easier to configure Wasmtime.</p>\n<p>Note that the <code>tests/all/winch.rs</code>  file is temporary, and the plan is to execute all the other integration tests with Winch at some point. In the case of <code>memory.rs</code>, that will be once Winch supports <code>memory64</code> hoping to reduce the amount of code needed in order to integrate Winch.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
