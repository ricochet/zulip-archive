In any case this is a significant difference on Windows from<br>\nother platforms because it makes loads/stores of wasm code have manual<br>\nchecks instead of relying on the guard page, causing runtime and<br>\ncompile-time slowdowns on Windows-only.</p>\n<p>I originally rediscovered this when investigating #2318 and saw that<br>\nboth the compile time of the module in question and trap information<br>\ntables were much larger than they were on Linux. Removing this<br>\nWindows-specific configuration fixed the discrepancies and afterwards<br>\nLinux and Windows were basically the same.</p>\n</blockquote>",
