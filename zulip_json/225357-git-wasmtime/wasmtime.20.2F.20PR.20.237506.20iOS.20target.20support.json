From what @alexcrichton explained to me it appears there would be some additional work would be needed<br>\nto postprocess a <code>*.cwasm</code> file into a linkable object files before this can be used in an iOS application. I would be interested in taking on this future work however my understanding of what this would involve is still very limited and I would need help sketching this out in detail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I haven't yet tested anything beyond making sure that the cargo check passes. If there are any suggestions of what might be useful to test at this stage before merging this I'd be happy to add in CI tests or do any manual testing deemed appropriate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>With limited knowledge about the differences between iOS and macOS I am assuming that macOS is identical to iOS for the purposes of this PR, e.g. I have no idea if the whole mach ports vs signals makes sense for iOS.  </li>\n<li>I made the minimal set of changes to get the code compiling, before merging the PR it might make sense to rename certain things e.g. it might make sense to rename the <code>macos</code> module in the runtime crate to <code>apple</code> or similar. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>As this is the first time contributing, please let me know if this PR makes sense or would need any changes to align with the contributing guidelines for this project.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
