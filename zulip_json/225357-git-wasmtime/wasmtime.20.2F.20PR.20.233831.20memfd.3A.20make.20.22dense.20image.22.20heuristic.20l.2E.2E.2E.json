A system that avoids memfd because of this would have an<br>\nundesirable performance reduction on such modules.</p>\n<p>Ultimately we should try to implement a hybrid scheme where we support<br>\noutlier/leftover initializers, but for now this PR makes the \"always<br>\nallow dense\" limit configurable. This way, embedders that want to ensure<br>\nthat memfd is used can do so, if they have other knowledge about the<br>\nmaximum heap size allowed in their system.</p>\n<p>(Partially addresses #3820 but let's leave it open to track the hybrid<br>\nidea)</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
