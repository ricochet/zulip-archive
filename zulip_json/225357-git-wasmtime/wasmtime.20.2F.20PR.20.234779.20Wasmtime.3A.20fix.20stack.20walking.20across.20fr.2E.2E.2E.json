The saved registers list is now maintained whenever updating the <code>CallThreadState</code> linked list by making the <code>CallThreadState::prev</code> field private and only accessible via a getter and setter, where the setter always maintains our invariants.</p>\n<p>Thanks to @bnjbvr for reporting this bug!</p>\n<p>@cfallin do you feel familiar enough with this stuff that you'd be comfortable reviewing it?
