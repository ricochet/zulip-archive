If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n<p>As someone with barely any experience with wasm, reading through the docs and following along with the examples,<br>\nThe examples which this patch modifies, both import a function <code>hello</code> from the host, and export one named <code>hello</code> from wat.</p>\n<p>To someone looking at it for the first time, it is quite confusing which instance the string 'hello' is referring to which function.<br>\nThis renames one the \"host\" one to the rather unimaginative <code>host_func</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
