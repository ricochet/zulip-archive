Namely the <code>may_enter</code> flag is now<br>\nexclusively managed in the <code>canon lift</code> function (which is<br>\n<code>TypedFunc::call</code>) and is only unset after post-return completes<br>\nsuccessfully. This implements semantics where if any trap happens for<br>\nany reason (lifting, lowering, execution, imports, etc) then the<br>\ninstance is considered permanently poisoned and can no longer be<br>\nentered.</p>\n<p>Tests needed many updates to create new instances where previously the<br>\nsame instance was reused after it had an erroneous state.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
