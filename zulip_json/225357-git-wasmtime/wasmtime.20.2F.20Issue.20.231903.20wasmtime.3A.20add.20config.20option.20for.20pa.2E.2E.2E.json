Does this work being a runtime configuration option? Is the purpose here to control memory usage? It seems like systems likely either support threads or they don't, and for systems that don't support threads it may make more sense for this to be a build-time configuration option. If the purpose is something like controlling memory usage though then that makes sense because it's specific to the runtime in question.</p>\n</blockquote>",

To be clear though I'm not saying this <em>must</em> change, I mostly just wanted to confirm if it worked for you. While a runtime configuration is possible I'm not sure if the target in question doesn't have <code>std::thread</code> at all or if it just returns errors. It's probably easiest to make this a runtime configuration option anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>",
