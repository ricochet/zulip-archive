To link things here this was implemented in wit-bindgen in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/pull/1003\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/pull/1003</a> and I think it'd be reasonable to copy over a similar structure into Wasmtime as well. @lwansbrough would you be interested in creating a PR perhaps?</p>\n</blockquote>",
