I'm going to push to this branch the changes I find necessary to wasi-c2 as I go, feel free to merge if you want I'll just create another branch to keep adding things I'm missing :) and if there are changes you think wrong please let me know! (I originally thought this would only expose WasiCtxBuilder, but ended up going around the code and randomly seeing that preopening a dir without setting stdio would currently make the dir actually be stdio, which would likely end up in wrong behavior, so I drive-by sent this change too, though I'm unsure how to test it as CI's already broken on this branch)</p>\n</blockquote>",
