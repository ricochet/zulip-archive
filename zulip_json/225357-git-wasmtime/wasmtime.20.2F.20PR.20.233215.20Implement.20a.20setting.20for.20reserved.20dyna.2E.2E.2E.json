Growth of a<br>\nstatic memory is simply making pages accessible, so it's quite fast.</p>\n<p>With the memory64 feature, however, this is no longer true since all<br>\nmemory64 memories are classified as \"dynamic\" at this time. Previous to<br>\nthis commit growth of a dynamic memory unconditionally moved the entire<br>\nlinear memory in the host's address space, always resulting in a new<br>\n<code>Mmap</code> allocation. This behavior is causing fuzzers to time out when<br>\nworking with 64-bit memories because incrementally growing a memory by 1<br>\npage at a time can incur a quadratic time complexity as bytes are<br>\nconstantly moved.</p>\n<p>This commit implements a scheme where there is now a tunable setting for<br>\nmemory to be reserved at the end of a dynamic memory to grow into. This<br>\nmeans that dynamic memory growth is ideally amortized as most calls to<br>\n<code>memory.grow</code> will be able to grow into the pre-reserved space. Some<br>\ncalls, though, will still need to copy the memory around.</p>\n<p>This helps enable a commented out test for 64-bit memories now that it's<br>\nfast enough to run in debug mode. This is because the growth of memory<br>\nin the test no longer needs to copy 4gb of zeros.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

I'd be afraid with a factor-based growth that you're always reserving 2x the virtual memory which may be a problem for some users. I'm semi-hoping that with a constant amount this is good enough to fly under some radars but immediately bad enough to get flagged by other radars to get a better solution here.</p>\n<p>That being said I am also sort of primarily situation-solving a fuzz-bug found where we timed out in memory growth here. I'm <em>hoping</em> that the eventual ask is that even for 64-bit memories we still want \"static\" heaps where the static size is limited to &gt;=4gb. For example we'd reserve 8gb and never move it but we wouldn't grow beyond 8gb (or something like that). In that scenario we wouldn't even hit the dynamic heap path since the maximum size would prove that unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Overall how do you feel about sitting on a simple add-the-constant-in strategy for now? I think it may be best to write some of this up in the <code>Config</code> documentation, basically saying \"if this doesn't work for you please let us know and we can figure out a better solution\"?</p>\n</blockquote>",

This concern goes away if the overall limit imposed by fuzzing (at the process VM limit level or within wasmtime proper) is only a small multiple of the extra growth space; e.g. if we grow with an extra 2GB and the limit during fuzzing is 8GB then we can only grow four times, so that's fine.</p>\n<p>Zooming out a bit, I do agree that setting a max growth limit and reserving that much VM space upfront is more likely the reasonable approach in the long run; it's hard for me to think of a heap-size limit that is large enough to be plausibly used in some use-case (very large movie-editing software, or in-memory cache, or...) at a few hundred GB or so, yet also too large to just reserve the address space upfront. But let's cross that bridge when we get there!</p>\n</blockquote>",

I actually chose the 2gb default because it's bigger than our fuzz limit of 1gb so the fuzzers are guaranteed to never find this corner case. Or at least <em>our</em> fuzzers won't find it... But I agree that it's just pushing the problem back, not actually solving anything as of yet.</p>\n</blockquote>",
