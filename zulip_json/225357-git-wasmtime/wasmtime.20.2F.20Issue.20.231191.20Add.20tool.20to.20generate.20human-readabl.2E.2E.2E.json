Sometimes a type is not bound correctly, sometimes a predicate is preventing the compiler from seeing the encoding, sometimes the instruction is in the wrong CPU mode, etc. Looking through the generated Rust code to figure out why no encoding is found is very difficult, mostly because of the lookup table structures. If we could at least see a list of all encodings, their recipes, types, and (eventually) predicates, then we could more quickly troubleshoot the above errors.</p>\n<p>I don't have all the information that might be useful in this PR (e.g. predicates) but I was trying to get something in place and then iterate. I am displaying the information I care about--is there something else that should be added? Or is a different format more helpful?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is there a way we could not generate this by default? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, we could. I like the idea of adding a <code>clif-util encodings</code> command to print this information to stdout and then the user can do what they want with it. Does that sound good?</p>\n</blockquote>",

That sort of defeats the purpose of avoiding a compile-time cost so I wanted to confirm we still want to do this. I measured it and when I tried <code>cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build -p cranelift-codegen -vv</code> I see a total compile time of ~34s and of that this listing code takes ~14ms. That doesn't seem over-large but we could still put it behind a feature flag for users who may want to disable it, though I would think this would be the type of thing that could be enabled by default.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It is solving a problem introduced at the meta-level (e.g. why is cranelift telling me that it can't find an encoding for this instruction?!?) which the new backend may not have. I'll re-open and modify as needed if I am still running into that type of issue once I am a bit more familiar with the new backend.</p>\n</blockquote>",
