Then I used <code>cargo fix</code> to remove those parentheses and also add underscores to newly-unused <code>AllocationConsumer</code> arguments. Next I used sed again to delete trivial assignments like <code>let x = x</code>, leaving more complicated cases as future work to clean up, and finally <code>cargo fmt</code> to delete blank lines and braces that are no longer necessary.</p>\n<p>Last, I deleted the newly-unused definitions of <code>next</code> and <code>next_writable</code> themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This is not an idiomatic way to do it, but simply deleting the assignment will introduce warnings, which breaks CI unless we do something about them.</li>\n<li><code>let tmp = *tmp;</code> dereferences a borrow of the <code>tmp</code> field and re-binds the name <code>tmp</code> to a copy of the field. Rust has syntax for doing this directly in the pattern match that bound the name <code>tmp</code> in the first place, which I'd prefer to use.</li>\n<li><code>let ri_hi = ri.hi;</code> or <code>let r = rn;</code> could be deleted as long as all the uses of the left-hand side are replaced by the right-hand side.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The changes in this PR are only the ones I could script with <code>sed</code> and the other tools I was using, and I want to stop at this point so this review is pretty mechanical too.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I intend to delete all those arguments, and all mentions of the <code>AllocationConsumer</code> type, in another PR after this one.</p>\n</blockquote>",
