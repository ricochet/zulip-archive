There's seemingly a lot of changes here but<br>\nit's intended to largely be code motion. The current thinking is to<br>\nclosely follow the x64 backend for how all this is handled and<br>\norganized.</p>\n<p>Major changes in this PR are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>Inst</code> enum is now defined in ISLE. This avoids having to define<br>\n  it in two places (once in Rust and once in ISLE). I've preserved all<br>\n  the comments in the ISLE and otherwise this isn't actually a<br>\n  functional change from the Rust perspective, it's still the same enum<br>\n  according to Rust.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lots of little enums and things were moved to ISLE as well. As with<br>\n<code>Inst</code> their definitions didn't change, only where they're defined.<br>\n  This will give future ISLE PRs access to all these operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Initial code for lowering <code>iconst</code>, <code>null</code>, and <code>bconst</code> are<br>\n  implemented. Ironically none of this is actually used right now<br>\n  because constant lowering is handled in <code>put_input_in_regs</code> which<br>\n  specially handles constants. Nonetheless I wanted to get at least<br>\n  something simple working which shows off how to special case various<br>\n  things that are specific to AArch64. In a future PR I plan to hook up<br>\n  const-lowering in ISLE to this path so even though<br>\n<code>iconst</code>-the-clif-instruction is never lowered this should use the<br>\n  const lowering defined in ISLE rather than elsewhere in the backend<br>\n  (eventually leading to the deletion of the non-ISLE lowering).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>IsleContext</code> skeleton is created and set up for future additions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some code for ISLE that's shared across all backends now lives in<br>\n<code>isle_prelude_methods!()</code> and is deduplicated between the AArch64<br>\n  backend and the x64 backend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Register mapping is tweaked to do the same thing for AArch64 that it<br>\n  does for x64. Namely mapping virtual registers is supported instead of<br>\n  just virtual to machine registers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My main goal with this PR was to get AArch64 into a place where new<br>\ninstructions can be added with relative ease. Additionally I'm hoping to<br>\nfigure out as part of this change how much to share for ISLE between<br>\nAArch64 and x64 (and other backends).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

(Though at least MOVZ and MOVN should be completely mutually exclusive, since all the other bits except the shifted 16-bit field are all 0 or all 1 respectively, but ORI's range overlaps with MOVZ.)</p>\n<p>So I think it's slightly better to exclude the priorities here so the decision trie build has more freedom to merge and reorder.</p>\n<p>Excellent attention to preserving original behavior though, thanks for taking care with that!</p>\n</blockquote>",
