The call will clobber the value in <code>x8</code>, but we require that value to be live to the end of the function so that we can return it, so RA2 rewrites the input constraint on the call to an <code>any</code> constraint and moves into <code>x8</code> right before the call. This ensures that we have a value (<code>x23</code>) to restore <code>x8</code> after the call, but does yield a slightly funny result. </p>\n<p>The move from <code>x23</code> into <code>x8</code> on line 910 could probably be eliminated by the redundant move eliminator, but we could also look into resolving the need for the value duplication on the in-progress overlap support PR...</p>\n</blockquote>",
