This implementation is particularly tricky for a number<br>\nof reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Lists have a number of validity checks which need to be carefully<br>\n  implemented. For example the byte length of the list passed to<br>\n  allocation in the destination module could overflow the 32-bit index<br>\n  space. Additionally lists in 32-bit memories need a check that their<br>\n  final address is in-bounds in the address space.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the effort to go ahead and support memory64 at the lowest layers<br>\n  this is where much of the magic happens. Lists are naturally always<br>\n  stored in memory and shifting between 64/32-bit address spaces<br>\n  is done here. This notably required plumbing an <code>Options</code> around<br>\n  during flattening/size/alignment calculations due to the size/types of<br>\n  lists changing depending on the memory configuration.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've also added a small <code>factc</code> program in this commit which should<br>\nhopefully assist in exploring and debugging adapter modules. This takes<br>\nas input a component (text or binary format) and then generates an<br>\nadapter module for all component function signatures found internally.</p>\n<p>This commit notably does not include tests for lists. I tried to figure<br>\nout a good way to add these but I felt like there were too many cases to<br>\ntest and the tests would otherwise be extremely verbose. Instead I think<br>\nthe best testing strategy for this commit will be through #4537 which<br>\nshould be relatively extensible to testing adapters between modules in<br>\naddition to host-based lifting/lowering.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
