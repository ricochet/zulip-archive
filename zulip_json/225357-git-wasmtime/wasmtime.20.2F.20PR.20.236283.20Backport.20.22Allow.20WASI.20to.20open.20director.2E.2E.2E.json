Opening a path which turns out to be a directory is not supposed to fail if this flag is not specified. However, wasi-common required callers to use it when opening directories.</p>\n<p>With this PR, we always open the path the same way whether or not the <code>O_DIRECTORY</code> flag is specified. However, after opening it, we <code>stat</code> it to check whether it turned out to be a directory, and determine which operations the file descriptor should support accordingly. In addition, we explicitly check whether the precondition defined by <code>O_DIRECTORY</code> is satisfied.</p>\n<p>On Windows, when opening a path which might be a directory using <code>CreateFile</code>, cap-primitives also removes the <code>FILE_SHARE_DELETE</code> mode. That means that if we implement WASI's <code>path_open</code> such that it always uses <code>CreateFile</code> on Windows, for both files and directories, then holding an open file handle prevents deletion of that file.</p>\n</blockquote>",
