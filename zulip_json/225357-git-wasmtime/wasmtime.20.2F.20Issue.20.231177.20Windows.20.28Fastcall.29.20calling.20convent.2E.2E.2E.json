What do you think?</p>\n<p>(If the reserved stack spaced for this would be prohibitive and code is generated assuming no callee saved registers, things could still work internally as they do now, but you'd still need to save XMM6-15 on entering Cranelift and restore them when exiting Cranelift).</p>\n</blockquote>",
