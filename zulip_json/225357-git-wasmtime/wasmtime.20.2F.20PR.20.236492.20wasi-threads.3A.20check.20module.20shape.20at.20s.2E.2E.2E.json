Previously, as reported in #6153, simple modules that made no use of thread spawning or shared memories were preemptively rejected when the wasi-threads context was created. This is too restrictive.</p>\n<p>Instead, this change does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it moves the check for whether a module is valid according to the wasi-threads specification to the point a new thread is spawned; this resolves #6153</li>\n<li>as noted in #6153, this change also adds a better error message indicating that wasi-threads expects a shared memory import</li>\n<li>the way this is implemented also improves the module instantiation: by constructing an <code>InstancePre</code> once when the <code>WasiThreadsCtx</code> is built, we might shave off a bit of time from the \"spawn a thread\" call; this supercedes a similar effort in #5741</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
