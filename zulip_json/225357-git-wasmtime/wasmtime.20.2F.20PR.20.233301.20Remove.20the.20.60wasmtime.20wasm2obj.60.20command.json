While<br>\nit's existed, however, it's never been documented in terms of the output<br>\nit's produced. AFAIK it's only ever been used for debugging to see the<br>\nmachine code output of Wasmtime on some modules. With recent changes to<br>\nthe module serialization output the output of <code>wasmtime compile</code>, the<br>\n<code>*.cwasm</code> file, is now a native ELF file which can be fed to standard<br>\ntools like <code>objdump</code>. Consequently I dont think there's any remaining<br>\nneed to keep <code>wasm2obj</code> around itself, so this commit removes the<br>\nsubcommand.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
