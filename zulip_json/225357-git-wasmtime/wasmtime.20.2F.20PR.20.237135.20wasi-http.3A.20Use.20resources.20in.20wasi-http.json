Using resources led to the complete removal of the <code>TableHttpExt</code> trait, and also the <code>TableLens</code> machinery that I had added earlier.</p>\n<p>One decision that I made here was to add static functions for the functions that we have that consume resources. These could have instead been functions not defined on the resource, but I liked being able to use a simple name like <code>finish</code> that was scoped to the resource rather than prefix it to make it unique.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
