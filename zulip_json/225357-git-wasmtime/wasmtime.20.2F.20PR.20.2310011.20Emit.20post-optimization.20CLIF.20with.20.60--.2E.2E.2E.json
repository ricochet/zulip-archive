This is now emitting the IR that's directly fed to the backend for lowering which reflects any mid-level transformation that's performed. It should still be possible to recover pre-optimized CLIF with <code>-O opt-level=0</code>.</p>\n<p>This then additionally refactors functions to emit CLIF in a more \"core\" location so all trampolines get their CLIF emitted as well in case those are needed for debugging.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
