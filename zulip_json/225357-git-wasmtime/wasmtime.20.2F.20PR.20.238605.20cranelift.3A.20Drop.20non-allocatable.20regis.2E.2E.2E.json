Now they are not only ignored by regalloc2, but the placeholders that it leaves in the allocation results are also ignored by Cranelift. So let's stop adding them to the operands list entirely.</p>\n</blockquote>",

However, if we don't ever generate RA2 operands for VRegs that have already been given allocations and we use those existing allocations during instruction emission, we just don't need the fixed-nonallocatable constraints!</p>\n<p>Very cool change :)</p>\n</blockquote>",
