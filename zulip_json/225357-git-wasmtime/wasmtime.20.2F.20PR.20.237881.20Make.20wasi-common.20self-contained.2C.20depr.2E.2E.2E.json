This PR is settling up on a bunch of tech debt, and is intended to be backported to the <code>release-18.0.0</code> branch. Once landed and backported, a follow-up PR will finish this work to be released as part of the <code>19.0</code> release.</p>\n<p>Now that Preview 2 is out, and wasmtime-wasi::preview2::preview1 is providing wasmtime-cli's default implementation of Preview 1 for a few releases, wasi-common only needs to exist to keep the (zombie, given the proposal status) wasmtime-wasi-threads implementation working. Since most embedders don't care about that, we want to push wasi-common out of the wasmtime-wasi crate.</p>\n<p>Historically, <code>wasi-common</code> was \"independent\" of <code>wasmtime</code> and <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> provided the integration. This hasn't actually been the case for a while, but now <code>wasi-common</code> uses a cargo feature <code>wasmtime</code> to determine whether to take a dependency on wasmtime. In addition, another historical accident of <code>wasi-common</code> was that it defined the <code>WasiFile</code>, <code>WasiDir</code>, <code>WasiSched</code> and etc traits, but didn't actually provide impls of those traits - those were provided by <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> and <code>wasi-tokio</code>. (That architectural wart was mostly because I didn't understand cargo features and optional dependencies when I developed it.) To gloss over that whole mess, <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> provided a conveniently integrated with wasmtime export of <code>wasi-common</code> hooked to <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code>'s impls at its root (as well as under <code>wasmtime_wasi::sync</code>) and the <code>wasi-common</code> hooked to <code>wasi-tokio</code> under <code>wasmtime_wasi::tokio</code>.</p>\n<p>This PR plows the whole legacy mess over into <code>wasi-common</code>, and leaves <code>wasmtime_wasi</code>'s exports of -common under <code>#[deprecated(since = \"18.0.0\", note = \"... permanent deletion in 19.0\"]</code> markers. These deprecations will be released for wasmtime 18 and then go away completely in wasmtime 19.</p>\n<p>The <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> and <code>wasi-tokio</code> crates have now been totally inlined at <code>wasi_common::sync</code> and <code>wasi_common::tokio</code>, behind features, as they always could have been. Wasmtime integration for those impls are defined in those mods as well, rather than in <code>wasmtime-wasi</code>. </p>\n<p>The <code>wasi-common::maybe_exit_on_error</code> func exists so that the cli and (recoils in horror) wasi-threads can terminate the entire process in the case of a trap, which is a pretty terrible idea in general. Besides providing the deprecated implementation, this PR moves the logic for the <code>preview2::I32Exit</code> handling to an associated function that extracts an exit code in the <code>wasmtime-wasi::preview2::error</code> module, and all calls to <code>std::process::exit</code> to the <code>wasmtime-cli</code> crate, since that is such an extraordinarily dangerous function. Additionally I switched to using a rustix export for the sigabort exit code, rather than libc, to eliminate an unnecessary dep.</p>\n<p>The follow-up PR will delete the deprecations (the entire contents of the root except for <code>pub mod preview2</code>), move the entire <code>wasmtime_wasi::preview2</code> mod up to the root, and shift all of the tests and examples throughout this repository to use wasmtime_wasi instead of wasi_common.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
