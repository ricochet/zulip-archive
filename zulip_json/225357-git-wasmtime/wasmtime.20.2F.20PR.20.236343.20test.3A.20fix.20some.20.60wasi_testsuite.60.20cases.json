That way the temporary directory clean up would removing any extra files and the <code>clean_garbage</code> filtering may not be necessary?</p>\n<p>Alternatively though explicitly cleaning out files I think is ok, and if this is how the test suite runs upstream I think it's fine to mirror that as well.</p>\n</blockquote>",
