The module in question had an exported function<br>\nwhich had multiple results, including floats. About a year ago I<br>\nreported a bug on v8 about functions with multiple results leading to<br>\nincorrect results, and it was fixed many months back but I don't think<br>\nthat we ever actually pulled in that update. After updating v8 I saw the<br>\ntest failure go away, so this update is being done to fix the fuzz bug<br>\ntest failure I saw.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
