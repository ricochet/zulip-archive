CA and CJ. These are used for some register-register arithmetic ops (CA) and jump instructions (CJ).</p>\n<p>It also changes all instructions that use a Label, StackMap or Relocation to use <code>emit_uncompressed</code> to ensure that we don't wrongly compress a instruction when it is expecting a different type of label or relocation.</p>\n<p>Capstone seems to not recognize <code>c.jr ra</code> as <code>c.ret</code>, but it is technically an alias as far as I understand it.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
