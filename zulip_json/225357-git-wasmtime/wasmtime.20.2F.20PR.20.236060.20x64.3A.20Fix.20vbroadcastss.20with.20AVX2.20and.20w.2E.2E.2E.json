The memory-to-xmm form of these instructions was available with the AVX instruction set, but the xmm-to-xmm form of these instructions wasn't available until AVX2. The instruction requirement for these are listed as AVX but the lowering rules are appropriately annotated to use either AVX2 or AVX when appropriate.</p>\n<p>While this should work in practice this didn't work for the assertion about enabled features for each instruction. The <code>vbroadcastss</code> instruction was listed as requiring AVX but could get emitted when AVX2 was enabled (due to the reg-to-reg form being available). This caused an issue for the fuzzer where AVX2 was enabled but AVX was disabled.</p>\n<p>One possible fix would be to add more opcodes, one for reg-to-reg and one for mem-to-reg. That seemed like somewhat overkill for a pretty niche situation that shouldn't actually come up in practice anywhere. Instead this commit changes all the <code>has_avx</code> accessors to the <code>use_avx_simd</code> predicate already available in the target flags. The <code>use_avx2_simd</code> predicate was then updated to additionally require <code>has_avx</code>, so if AVX2 is enabled and AVX is disabled then the <code>vbroadcastss</code> instruction won't get emitted any more.</p>\n<p>Closes #6059</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
