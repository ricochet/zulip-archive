The bug that happened was that sizes flowing into the pooling allocator were no longer host-page-size-aligned which caused syscalls to return an error unexpectedly. This meant that situations which were supposed to work were in fact not working.</p>\n<p>The fix in this commit is to page-align incoming sizes into the CoW-pieces of memory management. This is coupled with a few more assertions that the <code>accessible</code> field is always page-aligned, as expected.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
