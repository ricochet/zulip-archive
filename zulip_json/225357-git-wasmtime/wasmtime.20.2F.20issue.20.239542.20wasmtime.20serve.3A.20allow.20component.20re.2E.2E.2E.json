There's been some discussion amongst folks historically about this and one of the concerns historically has been about certain instances either requiring reuse or explicitly not supporting reuse and how to surface that in the component itself. Those discussions never reached a firm conclusion one way or another though which is why it's never landed as a feature yet. I'll note that I'm not intimately familiar with the concerns here and I'm mostly a proxy for other (e.g. @lukewagner I think knows much more about the concerns both ways here).</p>\n<p>Otherwise I'll definitely echo @bjorn3's idea of wizer. I suspect @ydnar you're already familiar with it but for anyone else who happens upon this in the future we've done a lot of work in Wasmtime to make instantiation as fast as possible through tools like wizer, APIs like <code>InstancePre</code>, and allocators like the pooling allocator in Wasmtime. That often can make instantiation fast enough for scenarios that instance reuse isn't required.</p>\n<p>I'd also still acknowledge though that even with all the tools in the toolbox I think there's still real situations where instance-per-request isn't fast enough. Personally I think we should support a flag like this on the command line (the default being perhaps a separate question).</p>\n</blockquote>",

(I'll point out that, since <code>wasi:cli/exit</code> is essentially just a trap without the negative connotation, this is an anti-composable thing for a component to do, since it tears down the whole component DAG including any client components that probably didn't want to die just because they called an imported utility function.  There are better options, but I think they're not relevant here.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Instances can indicate they wish to be reused [indefinitely], but the host does not have to honor it.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is what the \"reuse hint\" is.  I don't know if you're imagining some more dynamic indication (calling an imported function or something), but that's no less work (perhaps more) and has less up-front information that can be used by the runtime/platform to provide useful diagnostics to the developer.  I also don't know if you're worrying about what's expressible in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/pull/378\">core webassembly build target</a>, but we can always express the reuse hint as some symbolic core wasm import or export that <code>wasm-tools component new</code> (or core runtimes) understand the meaning of.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I don't know if you're proposing to change the <em>default</em> behavior of <code>wasmtime serve</code> (when no flags are specified), but I think a number of folks have strong opinions on that (since it preemptively gives up temporal isolation), so if you are I'd suggest separating out that discussion from the more mechanistic discussions of expressing intent here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
