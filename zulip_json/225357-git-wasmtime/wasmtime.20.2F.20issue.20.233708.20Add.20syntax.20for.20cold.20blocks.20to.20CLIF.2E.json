For example <code>block0(v0: i8) cold:</code>. This would avoid ambiguity if we get more block flags like to indicate landingpads for unwinding. It would also extend better to marking whole functions as cold if we get an inliner or change the way calls are codegened if the callee is marked as cold.</p>\n</blockquote>",
