This was mostly straightforward but while I<br>\nwas at it I fixed what appeared to be broken translations for I{8,16}<br>\nfor <code>clz</code>, <code>cls</code>, and <code>ctz</code>. Previously the lowerings would produce<br>\nresults as-if the input was 32-bits, but now I believe they all<br>\ncorrectly account for the bit-width.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
