(Recall that Linux<br>\nreserves key 0 for itself). While enabling various tests for MPK,<br>\ntests in <code>wasmtime_fuzzing::oracles</code> would fail because Wasmtime could<br>\nonly start allocating at key 2, e.g.; it turns out that the<br>\n<code>diff_v8::smoke</code> test instantiates V8 which happens to allocate a key<br>\nfor itself.</p>\n<p>The reason for the \"allocate keys 1-15 in order\" assumption was that the<br>\nlogic for calculating the stripe each key owned was very simple: <code>key -\n1</code>. We needed some way to map each key ID to the stripe ID it is<br>\nassociated with.</p>\n<p>With this change, we maintain a little bit more state in order to make<br>\nthe mapping less brittle. <code>ProtectionKey</code> stores the \"key ID to slice<br>\nID\" mapping as an additional <code>u32</code> in the struct. This means that,<br>\nregardless of what other code in the process allocates MPK keys,<br>\nWasmtime should be able to work fine with the remaining keys it can<br>\nallocate.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
