This landing pad bytes scanning assumes at least 2 bytes in the given buffer, but in a local test case I was trying against, the buffer was empty, so 0 bytes, so the subtract would underflow. Just adding this guard seems to make it work-ish -- I don't get full variable inspection power, but I expect that this is unrelated to my change.</p>\n</blockquote>",
