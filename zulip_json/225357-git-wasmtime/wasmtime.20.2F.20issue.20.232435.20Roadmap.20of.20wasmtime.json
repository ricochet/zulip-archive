In general this is mostly a topic for the bytecodealliance at large and the RFCs repository as well. At this time I do not believe there is an official roadmap for Wasmtime itself, and adding one is best done through an RFC rather than an issue here.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Similarly, a roadmap could potentially reveal if the project is focused on achieving some specific major goals, such as specific platform support. Moreover, a clear list, for example, for a release could attract more contributors as it would be clear what needs to be done.</p>\n<p>At the present moment, it is certainly vague what needs to be improved (besides checking issues), what new features could be developed (besides new proposals) and what are the overall goals.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>It could be added as a new document to the existing <code>docs</code> folder.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
