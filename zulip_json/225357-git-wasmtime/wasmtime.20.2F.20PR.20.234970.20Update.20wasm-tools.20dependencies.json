Names are dropped from parameters/results now in the internal representation since they were not used anyway. At this time the ability to bind a multi-return function has not been exposed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>wasmparser</code> validator pass will now share allocations with prior functions, providing what's probably a very minor speedup for Wasmtime itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The text format for many component-related tests now requires named parameters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some new relaxed-simd instructions are updated to be ignored.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope to have a follow-up to expose the multi-return ability to the embedding API of components.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so. The list of<br>\n  suggested reviewers on the right can help you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please ensure all communication adheres to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">code of\nconduct</a>.<br>\n--&gt;<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
