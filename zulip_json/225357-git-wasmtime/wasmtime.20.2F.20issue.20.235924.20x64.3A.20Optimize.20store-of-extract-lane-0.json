I hope to get to that next with the special casing and that way extracing <code>i32x4</code> and storing wouldn't use <code>movss</code> but would instead use <code>pextrd</code>.</p>\n<p>For AVX support this PR sort of conflicts with <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5931\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5931</a>, so I'll update this once that goes in and the helper will automatically use <code>vmovs{s,d}</code> for AVX.</p>\n</blockquote>",
