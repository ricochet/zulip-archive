Why does it need to be guarded to only run when there are some return values?</p>\n<p>Maybe the answer is just that the old implementation had this guard. But I think the old implementation, using <code>Iterator::any</code>, shouldn't have needed this either: <code>any</code> returns <code>false</code> on an empty iterator.</p>\n</blockquote>",
