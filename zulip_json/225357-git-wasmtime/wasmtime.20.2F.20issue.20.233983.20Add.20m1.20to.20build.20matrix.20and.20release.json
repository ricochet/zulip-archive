I don't think that CI can run the tests since I believe it's x86_64 hardware, but we should probably be able to add a builder so long as it doesn't take unduly long in CI. I think though that the <code>build-tarballs.sh</code> script needs to be updated for the new target</p>\n</blockquote>",

With the release process from <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3955\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3955</a> there will be a 2-week window between when a release branch is created and when it's actually published which should provide a good opportunity to test on non-CI-tested-platforms.</p>\n<p>If you'd like it could also be set up to notify you.
