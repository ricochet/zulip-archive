A couple of comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, is there an extra \"preopt.serialized\" that needs to be removed?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is something to do with peepmatic -- a generated file, resulting from the change of the CLIF instruction-definition file.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>there is no need to implement all <code>VecShiftImmOp</code>, only <code>SShr</code> is needed</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's true; but it was easy enough to implement and test <code>UShr</code> and <code>Shl</code> too.  I thought these would be useful.  In particular, for doing improved translations of CLIF vector shifts by immediate, at some future point.</p>\n</blockquote>",
