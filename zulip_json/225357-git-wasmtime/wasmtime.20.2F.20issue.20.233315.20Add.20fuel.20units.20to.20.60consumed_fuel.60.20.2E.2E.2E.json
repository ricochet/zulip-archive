If so that doesn't really have any units per-se and the exact calculation of what fuel is is somewhat fuzzy. It somewhat corresponds to wasm instructions, but not always precisely so.</p>\n<p>Fuel is not consumed by host functions, though, other than the <code>call</code> instruction used to enter host code. Different host code should always look like it consumes the same amount of fuel. Can you describe the situation in which you're seeing two host functions consume different  amounts of fuel?</p>\n</blockquote>",
