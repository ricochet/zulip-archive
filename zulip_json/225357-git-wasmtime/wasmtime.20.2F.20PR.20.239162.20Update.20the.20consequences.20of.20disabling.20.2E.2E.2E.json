Previously this would disable the reference-types proposal (and eventually once finished the gc/function-references proposal). This has the downside, however, of additionally disabling non-gc-related features that were bundled into the <code>reference-types</code> proposal such as multi-table and the encodings of table indices as LEBs in <code>call_indirect</code> instructions for example.</p>\n<p>The change in this commit is to instead toggle the newly-added <code>GC_TYPES</code> feature in <code>wasmparser</code>. This feature does not correspond to upstream wasm proposals and instead only gates types such as <code>externref</code> or <code>anyref</code>. The <code>funcref</code> and <code>exnref</code> types are not gated as they're not expected to require a full GC.</p>\n<p>This means that in Wasmtime the <code>reference-types</code> feature is now always active by default regardless of crate features. If the <code>gc</code> crate feature is disabled then only <code>externref</code> values are disallowed.</p>\n<p>This additionally flags <code>GC_TYPES</code> as unsupported in Winch due to no support for <code>externref</code> yet. This means, though, that Winch can be considered as supporting the <code>reference-types</code> proposal (and things like multi-table) as expected. Disabling <code>externref</code> support switched a few tests to failing so those exceptions are now listed in <code>tests/wast.rs</code></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
