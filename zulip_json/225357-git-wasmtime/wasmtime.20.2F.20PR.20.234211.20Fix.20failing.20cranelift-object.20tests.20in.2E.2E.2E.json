Tests currently pass in Rust 1.61 but not with prior versions.<br>\nGenerally we only support latest stable Rust but here it seems worthwhile<br>\nto fix a brittle specific-error-string match. This makes the expectations more<br>\ngeneric while still capturing the important part (\"has a null byte\").</p>\n<p>Fixes #4210.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
