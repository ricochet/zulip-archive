Only the implementation for Mach ports still needs to call set_jit_trap because it doesn't use test_if_trap.</p>\n<p>In addition I'm fixing an unrelated doc comment that I stumbled across while working on this.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think it actually makes sense when pattern matching in this particular case to declare \"I only care about these registers\" even if more get collected later: these two are the ones we need for a backtrace or coredump.</p>\n</blockquote>",
