I cancelled the CI after that PR merged to halt the release at the time, so Wasmtime 21.0.0 doesn't exist anywhere yet. This PR is a manual intervention now that <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8659\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8659</a> is fixed on both <code>main</code> and the release branch.</p>\n<p>This PR needs to have a non-empty change so I added a brief note to the release notes for a backported PR, which I'll forward-port to main as well after this.</p>\n<p>The automated release process will be triggered by the string in the commit for this PR, and it'll be as-if the previous release PR never merged and this is the actual auto-release PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",
