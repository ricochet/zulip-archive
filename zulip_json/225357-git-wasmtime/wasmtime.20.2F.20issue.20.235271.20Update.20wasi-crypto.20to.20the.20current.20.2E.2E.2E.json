(I'm not 100% sure that will affect <code>Cargo.lock</code>, but I think so?)

While wasi-crypto's dependency tree was grandfathered in behind the line in the sand I personally feel that we should hold all new WASI proposals, dependencies, etc, to a higher bar of inclusion, requiring an on-the-record vet entry for everything. Personally I do not think that we should go the route of excluding WASI proposals from the vetting process as I feel that inclusion into the upstream tree here is not a free operation and this is one of the costs.</p>\n<p>Note that dependencies do not need to be fully vetted, only the diff from the last known good version, aka the diff from where we drew the line in the sand awhile ago.</p>\n</blockquote>",
