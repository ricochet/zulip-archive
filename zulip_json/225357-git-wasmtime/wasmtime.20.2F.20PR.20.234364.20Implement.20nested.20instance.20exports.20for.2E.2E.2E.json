The support here adds new APIs for how instance<br>\nexports are accessed in the embedding API. For now this is mostly just a<br>\nfirst-pass where the API is somewhat confusing and has a lot of<br>\nlifetimes. I'm hoping that over time we can figure out how to simplify<br>\nthis but for now it should at least be expressive enough for exploring<br>\nthe exports of an instance.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
