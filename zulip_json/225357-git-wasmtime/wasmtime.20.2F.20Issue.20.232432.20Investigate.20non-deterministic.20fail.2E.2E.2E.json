The value's origin (valgrind <code>--track-origins=yes</code>) is:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">==</span><span class=\"mi\">473121</span><span class=\"o\">==</span><span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">Uninitialised</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">value</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">was</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">created</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">by</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">stack</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">allocation</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"o\">==</span><span class=\"mi\">473121</span><span class=\"o\">==</span><span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">at</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">0xEFC9F0</span>: <span class=\"nc\">wasmtime_runtime</span>::<span class=\"n\">traphandlers</span>::<span class=\"n\">setup_unix_sigaltstack</span>::<span class=\"n\">TLS</span>::<span class=\"n\">__init</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">local</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">rs</span>:<span class=\"mi\">157</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>So what I can gather from that is that we're reading uninitialized stack somewhere.

Some observations .. </p>\n<p>W.r.t pinpointing the patch that introduced the issue, I am finding it impossible to reproduce this issue using the script above before <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2365\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2365</a> . However I am not thinking this patch introduces this bug since it was seen as earlier as October here: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/runs/1323686030\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/runs/1323686030</a> </p>\n<p>W.r.t. simplifying the reproducer I am finding the error almost always occurs with the same tests involving negation or abs .. test such as:</p>\n<p>(assert_return (invoke \"add-neg\" (v128.const f64x2 1.125 1.125)<br>\n                                 (v128.const f64x2 0.125 0.125))<br>\n                                 (v128.const f64x2 -1.0 -1.0))</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>(assert_return (invoke \"f64x2.abs\" (v128.const f64x2 0x1.fffffffffffffp+1023 0x1.fffffffffffffp+1023))<br>\n                                   (v128.const f64x2 0x1.fffffffffffffp+1023 0x1.fffffffffffffp+1023))</p>\n<p>But when I try to isolate just these tests and run, the problem is not reproduced. It is hard for me to tell if the issue is with something in the lowering or something in the wast testing path. </p>\n<p>I did run valgrind against a277cf for example and there is a conspicuous
