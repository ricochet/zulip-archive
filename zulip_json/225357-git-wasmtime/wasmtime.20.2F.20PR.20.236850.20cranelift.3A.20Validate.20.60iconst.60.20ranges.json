Before this PR, for constants narrower than 64 bits we were preserving whether the input was written as a negative number or not based on whether the Imm64 was sign-extended or zero-extended. So some of the egraph tests used small negative numbers on input and got negative numbers in the test expectations output; others used large enough positive numbers to have the high bit set, which were printed as positive hex numbers before but get sign-extended by your change to the writer now.</p>\n<p>I think we should revert your change to the writer so it doesn't try to sign-extend constants, and then we'll probably just need to update the test expectations to reflect that some negative constants are printed as large positive hex values now.</p>\n</blockquote>",
