This PR makes a pass over the<br>\n\"Status\" section to fix that. It also removes some old/out-of-date<br>\ndetails, like <code>no_std</code> support (which has bitrotted).</p>\n<p>I got the quoted performance numbers by capturing a zoomed-in screenshot<br>\nof the bar plot in the linked paper and measuring their lengths in pixels (!).<br>\nI wish more research made raw numbers more easily available! Ideally we'd<br>\nsource performance claims from Sightglass continuous benchmarking,<br>\nonce that exists.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
