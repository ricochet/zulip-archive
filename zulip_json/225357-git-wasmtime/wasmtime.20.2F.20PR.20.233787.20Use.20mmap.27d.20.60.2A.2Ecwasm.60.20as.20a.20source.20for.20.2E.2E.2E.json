In this situation we already mmap the file from disk, and we can use the same technique that memfd uses where a copy-on-write mapping is made whenever a module is instantiated. This measn that all Unix platforms, not only Linux, can benefit from copy-on-write so long as the module comes from a precompiled module on disk.</p>\n<p>The first commit here is refactoring to enable this functionality on Linux. After the first commit we avoid creation of a <code>memfd</code> and instead map the raw underlying <code>*.cwasm</code> into memories. This involved moving the creation of the memory image to compile-time of <code>Module</code> rather than construction-time of <code>Module</code>, as well as aligning the data section to ensure it shows up at a page-offset boundary in the file (which is required by <code>mmap</code>). The second commit then enables this support to work on macOS which involved some <code>#[cfg]</code> followed by tweaking the <code>madvise</code> logic to instead blow away the mapping (no reuse on systems without <code>madvise(DONTNEED)</code> as there's no portable way to reset the CoW overlay)</p>\n<p>I tried for a bit to get this working on Windows, but while I could get things to compile I don't believe the same technique we're using here for Unix works on Windows. Windows appears to reject mapping a file onto a pre-existing region allocated with <code>VirtualAlloc</code>, meaning that all attemps to map the file into memory have failed so far for me. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41079506/how-to-reserve-memory-on-windows-and-later-map-files-into-it\">This StackOverflow question</a> seems to suggest that this may simply not work on Windows unless we use undocumented APIs. In any case the major benefit of this PR is avoiding extra file descriptors on Unix for modules created from files on disk, so while having Windows support would be nice it's not necessarily required.</p>\n</blockquote>",

(The awkward <code>MprotectFlags</code> maybe? Or stemming from an attempt to get this working on Windows too?)</p>\n<p>We actually have an interesting diversity of wrappers around <code>mprotect</code> in the codebase -- <code>region::protect</code> seems more common based on a cursory grep just now, while <code>rustix::io::mprotect</code> is used in the fiber library, here in memfd, and to set up a signal stack. So this is probably a larger question of \"which syscall wrapper do we prefer\". But IMHO at least within one unit of abstraction (the <code>MemFdSlot</code>) we should probably stick to one or else comment why we choose either one at each callsite...</p>\n</blockquote>",
