Another way would have to precise the rustc version in the <code>ci/run-tests.sh</code> script, but if I understand correctly it would also affect nightly versions of rustc that run these tests in automation.</p>\n<p>We could have the <code>ci/run-script.sh</code> look at an env variable that specifies which Rustc version it should use, or use a default rustc version (latest rustc stable, defined as a specific version number per @Jake-Shadle 's point), and specify this version in the <code>cargo</code> invokation. It's a bit annoying as it means that we'd need to manually bump the version number in there every time a new stable rustc is released.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts about this, or any other ideas for supporting this?</p>\n</blockquote>",
