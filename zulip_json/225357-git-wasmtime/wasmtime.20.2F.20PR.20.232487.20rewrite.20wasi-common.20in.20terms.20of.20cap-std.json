We found that this separation of concerns also makes it pretty enjoyable to write alternative implementations, e.g. a virtual filesystem (which will land in a future PR).</p>\n<h2>Traits for the rest of WASI's features</h2>\n<p>Other aspects of a WASI implementation are not yet considered resources and accessed by <code>handle</code>. We plan to correct this design deficiency in WASI in the future, but for now we have designed the following traits to provide embedders with the same sort of implementation flexibility they get with WasiFile/WasiDir:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Timekeeping: <code>clocks::WasiSystemClock</code> and <code>clock::WasiMonotonicClock</code> provide the two interfaces for a clock. <code>WasiSystemClock</code> represents time as a <code>cap_std::time::SystemTime</code>, and <code>WasiMonotonicClock</code> represents time as <code>cap_std::time::Instant</code>.</li>\n<li>Randomness: we re-use the <code>cap_rand::RngCore</code> trait to represent a randomness source. A trivial <code>Deterministic</code> impl is provided.</li>\n<li>Scheduling: The <code>WasiSched</code> trait abstracts over the <code>sched_yield</code> and <code>poll_oneoff</code> functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users can provide implementations of each of these interfaces to the <code>WasiCtx::builder(...)</code> function. The <code>wasi_cap_std_sync::WasiCtxBuilder::new()</code> function uses this public interface to plug in its own implementations of each of these resources.</p>\n<h2>Snapshot architecture</h2>\n<p>One goal we've had for a while, but not quite met, is for multiple WASI snapshots to provide an interface to the same underlying <code>WasiCtx</code>. This provides us a path to evolve WASI by allowing the same WASI Command to import functions from different snapshots - e.g. the user could use Rust's <code>std</code> which imports snapshot 1, but also depend directly on the <code>wasi</code> crate which imports some future snapshot 2. Right now, this amounts to supporting snapshot 1 and \"snapshot 0\" aka wasi_unstable at once.</p>\n<p>The architectural rules for snapshots are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snapshots are arranged into modules under <code>crate::snapshots::</code>.</li>\n<li>Each snapshot should invoke <code>wiggle::from_witx!</code> with <code>ctx: crate::WasiCtx</code> in its module, and impl all of the required traits.</li>\n<li>Snapshots can be implemented in terms of other snapshots. For example, snapshot 0 is mostly implemented by calling the snapshot 1 implementation, and converting its own types back and forth with the snapshot 1 types. In a few cases, that is not feasible, so snapshot 0 carries its own implementations in terms of the <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiSched</code> traits.</li>\n<li>Snapshots can be implemented in terms of the <code>Wasi*</code> traits given by <code>WasiCtx</code>. No further downcasting via the <code>as_any</code> escape hatch is permitted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The <code>cap-std-sync</code> implementation of the WASI traits</h2>\n<h1>Improving the WASI test suite</h1>\n<p>Wasi-common's test suite lives at <code>crates/test-programs</code>. </p>\n<h1>Changes to <code>wiggle-wasmtime</code> and dependents</h1>\n<h1>Changes to <code>wasmtime-wasi</code></h1>\n<h1>Regressions</h1>\n<p>Some behavior around trailing slashes in paths has changed from the test suite.

It uses @sunfishcode 's new <code>cap-std</code> family of crates to provide a sandboxed implementation of WASI on the local filesystem.</p>\n<p>Note that this is a breaking change for all users of WASI with Wasmtime, except for the C API.</p>\n<h1>Re-architecting <code>wasi-common</code></h1>\n<p>Over the past year or so, we've run up against many design problems in <code>wasi-common</code>. Many of these problems ended up being so fundamental that a rewrite, as prolonged as it was, ended up being more tractable than incremental changes.</p>\n<h2>The <code>Table</code></h2>\n<p><code>wasi-common</code> now has a <code>Table</code> type that is designed to map u32 handles to resources. The table is now part of the public interface to a <code>WasiCtx</code> - it is reference counted so that it can be shared beyond a <code>WasiCtx</code> with other WASI proposals (e.g. <code>wasi-crypto</code> and <code>wasi-nn</code>) to manage their resources. Elements in the <code>Table</code> are <code>Any</code> typed.</p>\n<p>The <code>Table</code> type is intended to model how the Interface Types concept of Resources is shaping up. Right now it is just an approximation.</p>\n<h2>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits</h2>\n<p>The WASI specification only defines one <code>handle</code> type, <code>fd</code>, on which all operations on both files and directories (aka dirfds) are defined. We believe this is a design mistake, and are architecting wasi-common to make this straightforward to correct in future snapshots of WASI. Wasi-common internally treats files and directories as two distinct resource types in the table - <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiFile&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiDir&gt;</code>. The snapshot 0 and 1 interfaces via <code>fd</code> will attempt to downcast a table element to one or both of these interfaces depending on what is appropriate - e.g. <code>fd_close</code> operates on both files and directories, <code>fd_read</code> only operates on files, and <code>fd_readdir</code> only operates on directories.</p>\n<p>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits are defined by <code>wasi-common</code> in terms of types defined directly in the crate's source code (I decided it should NOT those generated by the <code>wiggle</code> proc macros, see snapshot architecture below), as well as the <code>cap_std::time</code> family of types. And, importantly, <code>wasi-common</code> itself provides no implementation of <code>WasiDir</code>, and only two trivial implementations of <code>WasiFile</code> on the <code>crate::pipe::{ReadPipe, WritePipe}</code> types, which in turn just delegate to <code>std::io::{Read, Write}</code>.

The table is now part of the public interface to a <code>WasiCtx</code> - it is reference counted so that it can be shared beyond a <code>WasiCtx</code> with other WASI proposals (e.g. <code>wasi-crypto</code> and <code>wasi-nn</code>) to manage their resources. Elements in the <code>Table</code> are <code>Any</code> typed.</p>\n<p>The <code>Table</code> type is intended to model how the Interface Types concept of Resources is shaping up. Right now it is just an approximation.</p>\n<h2>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits</h2>\n<p>The WASI specification only defines one <code>handle</code> type, <code>fd</code>, on which all operations on both files and directories (aka dirfds) are defined. We believe this is a design mistake, and are architecting wasi-common to make this straightforward to correct in future snapshots of WASI. Wasi-common internally treats files and directories as two distinct resource types in the table - <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiFile&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiDir&gt;</code>. The snapshot 0 and 1 interfaces via <code>fd</code> will attempt to downcast a table element to one or both of these interfaces depending on what is appropriate - e.g. <code>fd_close</code> operates on both files and directories, <code>fd_read</code> only operates on files, and <code>fd_readdir</code> only operates on directories.</p>\n<p>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits are defined by <code>wasi-common</code> in terms of types defined directly in the crate's source code (I decided it should NOT those generated by the <code>wiggle</code> proc macros, see snapshot architecture below), as well as the <code>cap_std::time</code> family of types. And, importantly, <code>wasi-common</code> itself provides no implementation of <code>WasiDir</code>, and only two trivial implementations of <code>WasiFile</code> on the <code>crate::pipe::{ReadPipe, WritePipe}</code> types, which in turn just delegate to <code>std::io::{Read, Write}</code>. In order for <code>wasi-common</code> to access the local filesystem at all, you need to provide <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> impls through either the new <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> crate found at <code>crates/wasi-common/cap-std-sync</code> - see the section on that crate below - or by providing your own implementation from elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This design makes it possible for <code>wasi-common</code> embedders to statically reason about access to the local filesystem by examining what impls are linked into an application. We found that this separation of concerns also makes it pretty enjoyable to write alternative implementations, e.g. a virtual filesystem (which will land in a future PR).</p>\n<h2>Traits for the rest of WASI's features</h2>\n<p>Other aspects of a WASI implementation are not yet considered resources and accessed by <code>handle</code>. We plan to correct this design deficiency in WASI in the future, but for now we have designed the following traits to provide embedders with the same sort of implementation flexibility they get with WasiFile/WasiDir:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Timekeeping: <code>clocks::WasiSystemClock</code> and <code>clock::WasiMonotonicClock</code> provide the two interfaces for a clock. <code>WasiSystemClock</code> represents time as a <code>cap_std::time::SystemTime</code>, and <code>WasiMonotonicClock</code> represents time as <code>cap_std::time::Instant</code>.</li>\n<li>Randomness: we re-use the <code>cap_rand::RngCore</code> trait to represent a randomness source. A trivial <code>Deterministic</code> impl is provided.</li>\n<li>Scheduling: The <code>WasiSched</code> trait abstracts over the <code>sched_yield</code> and <code>poll_oneoff</code> functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users can provide implementations of each of these interfaces to the <code>WasiCtx::builder(...)</code> function. The <code>wasi_cap_std_sync::WasiCtxBuilder::new()</code> function uses this public interface to plug in its own implementations of each of these resources.</p>\n<h2>Snapshot architecture</h2>\n<p>One goal we've had for a while, but not quite met, is for multiple WASI snapshots to provide an interface to the same underlying <code>WasiCtx</code>. This provides us a path to evolve WASI by allowing the same WASI Command to import functions from different snapshots - e.g. the user could use Rust's <code>std</code> which imports snapshot 1, but also depend directly on the <code>wasi</code> crate which imports some future snapshot 2.

We believe this is a design mistake, and are architecting wasi-common to make this straightforward to correct in future snapshots of WASI. Wasi-common internally treats files and directories as two distinct resource types in the table - <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiFile&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiDir&gt;</code>. The snapshot 0 and 1 interfaces via <code>fd</code> will attempt to downcast a table element to one or both of these interfaces depending on what is appropriate - e.g. <code>fd_close</code> operates on both files and directories, <code>fd_read</code> only operates on files, and <code>fd_readdir</code> only operates on directories.</p>\n<p>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits are defined by <code>wasi-common</code> in terms of types defined directly in the crate's source code (I decided it should NOT those generated by the <code>wiggle</code> proc macros, see snapshot architecture below), as well as the <code>cap_std::time</code> family of types. And, importantly, <code>wasi-common</code> itself provides no implementation of <code>WasiDir</code>, and only two trivial implementations of <code>WasiFile</code> on the <code>crate::pipe::{ReadPipe, WritePipe}</code> types, which in turn just delegate to <code>std::io::{Read, Write}</code>. In order for <code>wasi-common</code> to access the local filesystem at all, you need to provide <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> impls through either the new <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> crate found at <code>crates/wasi-common/cap-std-sync</code> - see the section on that crate below - or by providing your own implementation from elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This design makes it possible for <code>wasi-common</code> embedders to statically reason about access to the local filesystem by examining what impls are linked into an application.

Wasi-common internally treats files and directories as two distinct resource types in the table - <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiFile&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiDir&gt;</code>. The snapshot 0 and 1 interfaces via <code>fd</code> will attempt to downcast a table element to one or both of these interfaces depending on what is appropriate - e.g. <code>fd_close</code> operates on both files and directories, <code>fd_read</code> only operates on files, and <code>fd_readdir</code> only operates on directories.</p>\n<p>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits are defined by <code>wasi-common</code> in terms of types defined directly in the crate's source code (I decided it should NOT those generated by the <code>wiggle</code> proc macros, see snapshot architecture below), as well as the <code>cap_std::time</code> family of types.

The table is now part of the public interface to a <code>WasiCtx</code> - it is reference counted so that it can be shared beyond a <code>WasiCtx</code> with other WASI proposals (e.g. <code>wasi-crypto</code> and <code>wasi-nn</code>) to manage their resources. Elements in the <code>Table</code> are <code>Any</code> typed.</p>\n<p>The <code>Table</code> type is intended to model how the Interface Types concept of Resources is shaping up. Right now it is just an approximation.</p>\n<h2>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits</h2>\n<p>The WASI specification only defines one <code>handle</code> type, <code>fd</code>, on which all operations on both files and directories (aka dirfds) are defined. We believe this is a design mistake, and are architecting wasi-common to make this straightforward to correct in future snapshots of WASI. Wasi-common internally treats files and directories as two distinct resource types in the table - <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiFile&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiDir&gt;</code>. The snapshot 0 and 1 interfaces via <code>fd</code> will attempt to downcast a table element to one or both of these interfaces depending on what is appropriate - e.g. <code>fd_close</code> operates on both files and directories, <code>fd_read</code> only operates on files, and <code>fd_readdir</code> only operates on directories.</p>\n<p>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits are defined by <code>wasi-common</code> in terms of types defined directly in the crate's source code (I decided it should NOT those generated by the <code>wiggle</code> proc macros, see snapshot architecture below), as well as the <code>cap_std::time</code> family of types. And, importantly, <code>wasi-common</code> itself provides no implementation of <code>WasiDir</code>, and only two trivial implementations of <code>WasiFile</code> on the <code>crate::pipe::{ReadPipe, WritePipe}</code> types, which in turn just delegate to <code>std::io::{Read, Write}</code>. In order for <code>wasi-common</code> to access the local filesystem at all, you need to provide <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> impls through either the new <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> crate found at <code>crates/wasi-common/cap-std-sync</code> - see the section on that crate below - or by providing your own implementation from elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This design makes it possible for <code>wasi-common</code> embedders to statically reason about access to the local filesystem by examining what impls are linked into an application. We found that this separation of concerns also makes it pretty enjoyable to write alternative implementations, e.g. a virtual filesystem (which will land in a future PR).</p>\n<h2>Traits for the rest of WASI's features</h2>\n<p>Other aspects of a WASI implementation are not yet considered resources and accessed by <code>handle</code>. We plan to correct this design deficiency in WASI in the future, but for now we have designed the following traits to provide embedders with the same sort of implementation flexibility they get with WasiFile/WasiDir:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Timekeeping: <code>clocks::WasiSystemClock</code> and <code>clock::WasiMonotonicClock</code> provide the two interfaces for a clock. <code>WasiSystemClock</code> represents time as a <code>cap_std::time::SystemTime</code>, and <code>WasiMonotonicClock</code> represents time as <code>cap_std::time::Instant</code>.</li>\n<li>Randomness: we re-use the <code>cap_rand::RngCore</code> trait to represent a randomness source.

The <code>wasi_cap_std_sync::WasiCtxBuilder::new()</code> function uses this public interface to plug in its own implementations of each of these resources.</p>\n<h2>Snapshot architecture</h2>\n<p>One goal we've had for a while, but not quite met, is for multiple WASI snapshots to provide an interface to the same underlying <code>WasiCtx</code>. This provides us a path to evolve WASI by allowing the same WASI Command to import functions from different snapshots - e.g. the user could use Rust's <code>std</code> which imports snapshot 1, but also depend directly on the <code>wasi</code> crate which imports some future snapshot 2.

It uses @sunfishcode 's new <code>cap-std</code> family of crates to provide a sandboxed implementation of WASI on the local filesystem.</p>\n<p>Note that this is a breaking change for all users of WASI with Wasmtime, except for the C API.</p>\n<h1>Re-architecting <code>wasi-common</code></h1>\n<p>Over the past year or so, we've run up against many design problems in <code>wasi-common</code>. Many of these problems ended up being so fundamental that a rewrite, as prolonged as it was, ended up being more tractable than incremental changes.</p>\n<h2>The <code>Table</code></h2>\n<p><code>wasi-common</code> now has a <code>Table</code> type that is designed to map u32 handles to resources. The table is now part of the public interface to a <code>WasiCtx</code> - it is reference counted so that it can be shared beyond a <code>WasiCtx</code> with other WASI proposals (e.g. <code>wasi-crypto</code> and <code>wasi-nn</code>) to manage their resources. Elements in the <code>Table</code> are <code>Any</code> typed.</p>\n<p>The <code>Table</code> type is intended to model how the Interface Types concept of Resources is shaping up. Right now it is just an approximation.</p>\n<h2>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits</h2>\n<p>The WASI specification only defines one <code>handle</code> type, <code>fd</code>, on which all operations on both files and directories (aka dirfds) are defined. We believe this is a design mistake, and are architecting wasi-common to make this straightforward to correct in future snapshots of WASI. Wasi-common internally treats files and directories as two distinct resource types in the table - <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiFile&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiDir&gt;</code>. The snapshot 0 and 1 interfaces via <code>fd</code> will attempt to downcast a table element to one or both of these interfaces depending on what is appropriate - e.g. <code>fd_close</code> operates on both files and directories, <code>fd_read</code> only operates on files, and <code>fd_readdir</code> only operates on directories.</p>\n<p>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits are defined by <code>wasi-common</code> in terms of types defined directly in the crate's source code (I decided it should NOT those generated by the <code>wiggle</code> proc macros, see snapshot architecture below), as well as the <code>cap_std::time</code> family of types. And, importantly, <code>wasi-common</code> itself provides no implementation of <code>WasiDir</code>, and only two trivial implementations of <code>WasiFile</code> on the <code>crate::pipe::{ReadPipe, WritePipe}</code> types, which in turn just delegate to <code>std::io::{Read, Write}</code>. In order for <code>wasi-common</code> to access the local filesystem at all, you need to provide <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> impls through either the new <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> crate found at <code>crates/wasi-common/cap-std-sync</code> - see the section on that crate below - or by providing your own implementation from elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This design makes it possible for <code>wasi-common</code> embedders to statically reason about access to the local filesystem by examining what impls are linked into an application. We found that this separation of concerns also makes it pretty enjoyable to write alternative implementations, e.g. a virtual filesystem (which will land in a future PR).</p>\n<h2>Traits for the rest of WASI's features</h2>\n<p>Other aspects of a WASI implementation are not yet considered resources and accessed by <code>handle</code>. We plan to correct this design deficiency in WASI in the future, but for now we have designed the following traits to provide embedders with the same sort of implementation flexibility they get with WasiFile/WasiDir:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Timekeeping: <code>clocks::WasiSystemClock</code> and <code>clock::WasiMonotonicClock</code> provide the two interfaces for a clock. <code>WasiSystemClock</code> represents time as a <code>cap_std::time::SystemTime</code>, and <code>WasiMonotonicClock</code> represents time as <code>cap_std::time::Instant</code>.</li>\n<li>Randomness: we re-use the <code>cap_rand::RngCore</code> trait to represent a randomness source. A trivial <code>Deterministic</code> impl is provided.</li>\n<li>Scheduling: The <code>WasiSched</code> trait abstracts over the <code>sched_yield</code> and <code>poll_oneoff</code> functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users can provide implementations of each of these interfaces to the <code>WasiCtx::builder(...)</code> function. The <code>wasi_cap_std_sync::WasiCtxBuilder::new()</code> function uses this public interface to plug in its own implementations of each of these resources.</p>\n<h2>Snapshot architecture</h2>\n<p>One goal we've had for a while, but not quite met, is for multiple WASI snapshots to provide an interface to the same underlying <code>WasiCtx</code>. This provides us a path to evolve WASI by allowing the same WASI Command to import functions from different snapshots - e.g. the user could use Rust's <code>std</code> which imports snapshot 1, but also depend directly on the <code>wasi</code> crate which imports some future snapshot 2. Right now, this amounts to supporting snapshot 1 and \"snapshot 0\" aka wasi_unstable at once.</p>\n<p>The architectural rules for snapshots are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snapshots are arranged into modules under <code>crate::snapshots::</code>.</li>\n<li>Each snapshot should invoke <code>wiggle::from_witx!</code> with <code>ctx: crate::WasiCtx</code> in its module, and impl all of the required traits.</li>\n<li>Snapshots can be implemented in terms of other snapshots. For example, snapshot 0 is mostly implemented by calling the snapshot 1 implementation, and converting its own types back and forth with the snapshot 1 types. In a few cases, that is not feasible, so snapshot 0 carries its own implementations in terms of the <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiSched</code> traits.</li>\n<li>Snapshots can be implemented in terms of the <code>Wasi*</code> traits given by <code>WasiCtx</code>. No further downcasting via the <code>as_any</code> escape hatch is permitted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The <code>wasi_common::Error</code> type</h2>\n<p><code>wasi_common::Error</code> is now <code>anyhow::Error</code>. <code>wasi_common::snapshots::preview_1</code> contains all of the logic for transforming an <code>Error</code> into an <code>Errno</code>, by downcasting the error into any of</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>std::io::Error</code> - these are thrown by <code>std</code>, <code>cap_std</code>, etc for most of the operations WASI is concerned with.</li>\n<li><code>wasi_common::ErrorKind</code> - these are a subset of the Errnos, and are constructed directly by wasi-common or an impl rather than coming from the OS or some library which doesn't know about WASI.</li>\n<li><code>wiggle::GuestError</code></li>\n<li><code>std::num::TryFromIntError</code></li>\n<li><code>std::str::Utf8Error</code><br>\nand then applying specialized logic to translate each of those into <code>Errno</code>s.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>wasi_common::ErrorExt</code> trait provides human-friendly constructors for the <code>wasi_common::ErrorKind</code> variants .</p>\n<p>If you throw an error that does not downcast to one of those, it will turn into a <code>wiggle::Trap</code> and terminate execution.</p>\n<p>The real value of using <code>anyhow::Error</code> here is being able to use <code>anyhow::Result::context</code> to aid in debugging of errors.</p>\n<h2>The <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> implementation of the WASI traits</h2>\n<p>The <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> crate provides impl of <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> in terms of <code>cap_std::fs::{File, Dir}</code>. These types provide sandboxed access to the local filesystem on both Unix and Windows.</p>\n<p>The entire design story of <code>cap-std</code> is much bigger than we can address here, but in short, its functionality replaces all of the <code>wasi_common::sys</code> hierarchy, as well as the <code>yanix</code> / <code>winx</code> crates.

It uses @sunfishcode 's new <code>cap-std</code> family of crates to provide a sandboxed implementation of WASI on the local filesystem.</p>\n<p>Note that this is a breaking change for all users of WASI with Wasmtime, except for the C API.</p>\n<h1>Re-architecting <code>wasi-common</code></h1>\n<p>Over the past year or so, we've run up against many design problems in <code>wasi-common</code>. Many of these problems ended up being so fundamental that a rewrite, as prolonged as it was, ended up being more tractable than incremental changes.</p>\n<h2>The <code>Table</code></h2>\n<p><code>wasi-common</code> now has a <code>Table</code> type that is designed to map u32 handles to resources. The table is now part of the public interface to a <code>WasiCtx</code> - it is reference counted so that it can be shared beyond a <code>WasiCtx</code> with other WASI proposals (e.g. <code>wasi-crypto</code> and <code>wasi-nn</code>) to manage their resources. Elements in the <code>Table</code> are <code>Any</code> typed.</p>\n<p>The <code>Table</code> type is intended to model how the Interface Types concept of Resources is shaping up. Right now it is just an approximation.</p>\n<h2>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits</h2>\n<p>The WASI specification only defines one <code>handle</code> type, <code>fd</code>, on which all operations on both files and directories (aka dirfds) are defined. We believe this is a design mistake, and are architecting wasi-common to make this straightforward to correct in future snapshots of WASI. Wasi-common internally treats files and directories as two distinct resource types in the table - <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiFile&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiDir&gt;</code>. The snapshot 0 and 1 interfaces via <code>fd</code> will attempt to downcast a table element to one or both of these interfaces depending on what is appropriate - e.g. <code>fd_close</code> operates on both files and directories, <code>fd_read</code> only operates on files, and <code>fd_readdir</code> only operates on directories.</p>\n<p>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits are defined by <code>wasi-common</code> in terms of types defined directly in the crate's source code (I decided it should NOT those generated by the <code>wiggle</code> proc macros, see snapshot architecture below), as well as the <code>cap_std::time</code> family of types. And, importantly, <code>wasi-common</code> itself provides no implementation of <code>WasiDir</code>, and only two trivial implementations of <code>WasiFile</code> on the <code>crate::pipe::{ReadPipe, WritePipe}</code> types, which in turn just delegate to <code>std::io::{Read, Write}</code>. In order for <code>wasi-common</code> to access the local filesystem at all, you need to provide <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> impls through either the new <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> crate found at <code>crates/wasi-common/cap-std-sync</code> - see the section on that crate below - or by providing your own implementation from elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This design makes it possible for <code>wasi-common</code> embedders to statically reason about access to the local filesystem by examining what impls are linked into an application. We found that this separation of concerns also makes it pretty enjoyable to write alternative implementations, e.g. a virtual filesystem (which will land in a future PR).</p>\n<h2>Traits for the rest of WASI's features</h2>\n<p>Other aspects of a WASI implementation are not yet considered resources and accessed by <code>handle</code>. We plan to correct this design deficiency in WASI in the future, but for now we have designed the following traits to provide embedders with the same sort of implementation flexibility they get with WasiFile/WasiDir:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Timekeeping: <code>clocks::WasiSystemClock</code> and <code>clock::WasiMonotonicClock</code> provide the two interfaces for a clock. <code>WasiSystemClock</code> represents time as a <code>cap_std::time::SystemTime</code>, and <code>WasiMonotonicClock</code> represents time as <code>cap_std::time::Instant</code>.</li>\n<li>Randomness: we re-use the <code>cap_rand::RngCore</code> trait to represent a randomness source. A trivial <code>Deterministic</code> impl is provided.</li>\n<li>Scheduling: The <code>WasiSched</code> trait abstracts over the <code>sched_yield</code> and <code>poll_oneoff</code> functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users can provide implementations of each of these interfaces to the <code>WasiCtx::builder(...)</code> function. The <code>wasi_cap_std_sync::WasiCtxBuilder::new()</code> function uses this public interface to plug in its own implementations of each of these resources.</p>\n<h2>Snapshot architecture</h2>\n<p>One goal we've had for a while, but not quite met, is for multiple WASI snapshots to provide an interface to the same underlying <code>WasiCtx</code>. This provides us a path to evolve WASI by allowing the same WASI Command to import functions from different snapshots - e.g. the user could use Rust's <code>std</code> which imports snapshot 1, but also depend directly on the <code>wasi</code> crate which imports some future snapshot 2. Right now, this amounts to supporting snapshot 1 and \"snapshot 0\" aka wasi_unstable at once.</p>\n<p>The architectural rules for snapshots are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snapshots are arranged into modules under <code>crate::snapshots::</code>.</li>\n<li>Each snapshot should invoke <code>wiggle::from_witx!</code> with <code>ctx: crate::WasiCtx</code> in its module, and impl all of the required traits.</li>\n<li>Snapshots can be implemented in terms of other snapshots. For example, snapshot 0 is mostly implemented by calling the snapshot 1 implementation, and converting its own types back and forth with the snapshot 1 types. In a few cases, that is not feasible, so snapshot 0 carries its own implementations in terms of the <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiSched</code> traits.</li>\n<li>Snapshots can be implemented in terms of the <code>Wasi*</code> traits given by <code>WasiCtx</code>.

The table is now part of the public interface to a <code>WasiCtx</code> - it is reference counted so that it can be shared beyond a <code>WasiCtx</code> with other WASI proposals (e.g. <code>wasi-crypto</code> and <code>wasi-nn</code>) to manage their resources.

We believe this is a design mistake, and are architecting wasi-common to make this straightforward to correct in future snapshots of WASI. Wasi-common internally treats files and directories as two distinct resource types in the table - <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiFile&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiDir&gt;</code>. The snapshot 0 and 1 interfaces via <code>fd</code> will attempt to downcast a table element to one or both of these interfaces depending on what is appropriate - e.g. <code>fd_close</code> operates on both files and directories, <code>fd_read</code> only operates on files, and <code>fd_readdir</code> only operates on directories.</p>\n<p>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits are defined by <code>wasi-common</code> in terms of types defined directly in the crate's source code (I decided it should NOT those generated by the <code>wiggle</code> proc macros, see snapshot architecture below), as well as the <code>cap_std::time</code> family of types. And, importantly, <code>wasi-common</code> itself provides no implementation of <code>WasiDir</code>, and only two trivial implementations of <code>WasiFile</code> on the <code>crate::pipe::{ReadPipe, WritePipe}</code> types, which in turn just delegate to <code>std::io::{Read, Write}</code>. In order for <code>wasi-common</code> to access the local filesystem at all, you need to provide <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> impls through either the new <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> crate found at <code>crates/wasi-common/cap-std-sync</code> - see the section on that crate below - or by providing your own implementation from elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This design makes it possible for <code>wasi-common</code> embedders to statically reason about access to the local filesystem by examining what impls are linked into an application.

The table is now part of the public interface to a <code>WasiCtx</code> - it is reference counted so that it can be shared beyond a <code>WasiCtx</code> with other WASI proposals (e.g. <code>wasi-crypto</code> and <code>wasi-nn</code>) to manage their resources. Elements in the <code>Table</code> are <code>Any</code> typed.</p>\n<p>The <code>Table</code> type is intended to model how the Interface Types concept of Resources is shaping up. Right now it is just an approximation.</p>\n<h2>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits</h2>\n<p>The WASI specification only defines one <code>handle</code> type, <code>fd</code>, on which all operations on both files and directories (aka dirfds) are defined. We believe this is a design mistake, and are architecting wasi-common to make this straightforward to correct in future snapshots of WASI. Wasi-common internally treats files and directories as two distinct resource types in the table - <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiFile&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiDir&gt;</code>. The snapshot 0 and 1 interfaces via <code>fd</code> will attempt to downcast a table element to one or both of these interfaces depending on what is appropriate - e.g. <code>fd_close</code> operates on both files and directories, <code>fd_read</code> only operates on files, and <code>fd_readdir</code> only operates on directories.</p>\n<p>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits are defined by <code>wasi-common</code> in terms of types defined directly in the crate's source code (I decided it should NOT those generated by the <code>wiggle</code> proc macros, see snapshot architecture below), as well as the <code>cap_std::time</code> family of types. And, importantly, <code>wasi-common</code> itself provides no implementation of <code>WasiDir</code>, and only two trivial implementations of <code>WasiFile</code> on the <code>crate::pipe::{ReadPipe, WritePipe}</code> types, which in turn just delegate to <code>std::io::{Read, Write}</code>. In order for <code>wasi-common</code> to access the local filesystem at all, you need to provide <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> impls through either the new <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> crate found at <code>crates/wasi-common/cap-std-sync</code> - see the section on that crate below - or by providing your own implementation from elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This design makes it possible for <code>wasi-common</code> embedders to statically reason about access to the local filesystem by examining what impls are linked into an application. We found that this separation of concerns also makes it pretty enjoyable to write alternative implementations, e.g. a virtual filesystem (which will land in a future PR).</p>\n<h2>Traits for the rest of WASI's features</h2>\n<p>Other aspects of a WASI implementation are not yet considered resources and accessed by <code>handle</code>. We plan to correct this design deficiency in WASI in the future, but for now we have designed the following traits to provide embedders with the same sort of implementation flexibility they get with WasiFile/WasiDir:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Timekeeping: <code>clocks::WasiSystemClock</code> and <code>clock::WasiMonotonicClock</code> provide the two interfaces for a clock. <code>WasiSystemClock</code> represents time as a <code>cap_std::time::SystemTime</code>, and <code>WasiMonotonicClock</code> represents time as <code>cap_std::time::Instant</code>.</li>\n<li>Randomness: we re-use the <code>cap_rand::RngCore</code> trait to represent a randomness source.

The <code>wasi_cap_std_sync::WasiCtxBuilder::new()</code> function uses this public interface to plug in its own implementations of each of these resources.</p>\n<h2>Snapshot architecture</h2>\n<p>One goal we've had for a while, but not quite met, is for multiple WASI snapshots to provide an interface to the same underlying <code>WasiCtx</code>. This provides us a path to evolve WASI by allowing the same WASI Command to import functions from different snapshots - e.g. the user could use Rust's <code>std</code> which imports snapshot 1, but also depend directly on the <code>wasi</code> crate which imports some future snapshot 2.

Wasi-common internally treats files and directories as two distinct resource types in the table - <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiFile&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiDir&gt;</code>. The snapshot 0 and 1 interfaces via <code>fd</code> will attempt to downcast a table element to one or both of these interfaces depending on what is appropriate - e.g. <code>fd_close</code> operates on both files and directories, <code>fd_read</code> only operates on files, and <code>fd_readdir</code> only operates on directories.</p>\n<p>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits are defined by <code>wasi-common</code> in terms of types defined directly in the crate's source code (I decided it should NOT those generated by the <code>wiggle</code> proc macros, see snapshot architecture below), as well as the <code>cap_std::time</code> family of types.

It uses @sunfishcode 's new <code>cap-std</code> family of crates to provide a sandboxed implementation of WASI on the local filesystem.</p>\n<p>Note that this is a breaking change for all users of WASI with Wasmtime, except for the C API.</p>\n<h1>Re-architecting <code>wasi-common</code></h1>\n<p>Over the past year or so, we've run up against many design problems in <code>wasi-common</code>. Many of these problems ended up being so fundamental that a rewrite, as prolonged as it was, ended up being more tractable than incremental changes.</p>\n<h2>The <code>Table</code></h2>\n<p><code>wasi-common</code> now has a <code>Table</code> type that is designed to map u32 handles to resources. The table is now part of the public interface to a <code>WasiCtx</code> - it is reference counted so that it can be shared beyond a <code>WasiCtx</code> with other WASI proposals (e.g. <code>wasi-crypto</code> and <code>wasi-nn</code>) to manage their resources. Elements in the <code>Table</code> are <code>Any</code> typed.</p>\n<p>The <code>Table</code> type is intended to model how the Interface Types concept of Resources is shaping up. Right now it is just an approximation.</p>\n<h2>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits</h2>\n<p>The WASI specification only defines one <code>handle</code> type, <code>fd</code>, on which all operations on both files and directories (aka dirfds) are defined. We believe this is a design mistake, and are architecting wasi-common to make this straightforward to correct in future snapshots of WASI. Wasi-common internally treats files and directories as two distinct resource types in the table - <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiFile&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;dyn WasiDir&gt;</code>. The snapshot 0 and 1 interfaces via <code>fd</code> will attempt to downcast a table element to one or both of these interfaces depending on what is appropriate - e.g. <code>fd_close</code> operates on both files and directories, <code>fd_read</code> only operates on files, and <code>fd_readdir</code> only operates on directories.</p>\n<p>The <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> traits are defined by <code>wasi-common</code> in terms of types defined directly in the crate's source code (I decided it should NOT those generated by the <code>wiggle</code> proc macros, see snapshot architecture below), as well as the <code>cap_std::time</code> family of types. And, importantly, <code>wasi-common</code> itself provides no implementation of <code>WasiDir</code>, and only two trivial implementations of <code>WasiFile</code> on the <code>crate::pipe::{ReadPipe, WritePipe}</code> types, which in turn just delegate to <code>std::io::{Read, Write}</code>. In order for <code>wasi-common</code> to access the local filesystem at all, you need to provide <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> impls through either the new <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> crate found at <code>crates/wasi-common/cap-std-sync</code> - see the section on that crate below - or by providing your own implementation from elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This design makes it possible for <code>wasi-common</code> embedders to statically reason about access to the local filesystem by examining what impls are linked into an application. We found that this separation of concerns also makes it pretty enjoyable to write alternative implementations, e.g. a virtual filesystem (which will land in a future PR).</p>\n<h2>Traits for the rest of WASI's features</h2>\n<p>Other aspects of a WASI implementation are not yet considered resources and accessed by <code>handle</code>. We plan to correct this design deficiency in WASI in the future, but for now we have designed the following traits to provide embedders with the same sort of implementation flexibility they get with WasiFile/WasiDir:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Timekeeping: <code>clocks::WasiSystemClock</code> and <code>clock::WasiMonotonicClock</code> provide the two interfaces for a clock. <code>WasiSystemClock</code> represents time as a <code>cap_std::time::SystemTime</code>, and <code>WasiMonotonicClock</code> represents time as <code>cap_std::time::Instant</code>.</li>\n<li>Randomness: we re-use the <code>cap_rand::RngCore</code> trait to represent a randomness source. A trivial <code>Deterministic</code> impl is provided.</li>\n<li>Scheduling: The <code>WasiSched</code> trait abstracts over the <code>sched_yield</code> and <code>poll_oneoff</code> functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users can provide implementations of each of these interfaces to the <code>WasiCtx::builder(...)</code> function. The <code>wasi_cap_std_sync::WasiCtxBuilder::new()</code> function uses this public interface to plug in its own implementations of each of these resources.</p>\n<h2>Snapshot architecture</h2>\n<p>One goal we've had for a while, but not quite met, is for multiple WASI snapshots to provide an interface to the same underlying <code>WasiCtx</code>. This provides us a path to evolve WASI by allowing the same WASI Command to import functions from different snapshots - e.g. the user could use Rust's <code>std</code> which imports snapshot 1, but also depend directly on the <code>wasi</code> crate which imports some future snapshot 2. Right now, this amounts to supporting snapshot 1 and \"snapshot 0\" aka wasi_unstable at once.</p>\n<p>The architectural rules for snapshots are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snapshots are arranged into modules under <code>crate::snapshots::</code>.</li>\n<li>Each snapshot should invoke <code>wiggle::from_witx!</code> with <code>ctx: crate::WasiCtx</code> in its module, and impl all of the required traits.</li>\n<li>Snapshots can be implemented in terms of other snapshots. For example, snapshot 0 is mostly implemented by calling the snapshot 1 implementation, and converting its own types back and forth with the snapshot 1 types. In a few cases, that is not feasible, so snapshot 0 carries its own implementations in terms of the <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiSched</code> traits.</li>\n<li>Snapshots can be implemented in terms of the <code>Wasi*</code> traits given by <code>WasiCtx</code>. No further downcasting via the <code>as_any</code> escape hatch is permitted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The <code>wasi_common::Error</code> type</h2>\n<p><code>wasi_common::Error</code> is now <code>anyhow::Error</code>. <code>wasi_common::snapshots::preview_1</code> contains all of the logic for transforming an <code>Error</code> into an <code>Errno</code>, by downcasting the error into any of</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>std::io::Error</code> - these are thrown by <code>std</code>, <code>cap_std</code>, etc for most of the operations WASI is concerned with.</li>\n<li><code>wasi_common::ErrorKind</code> - these are a subset of the Errnos, and are constructed directly by wasi-common or an impl rather than coming from the OS or some library which doesn't know about WASI.</li>\n<li><code>wiggle::GuestError</code></li>\n<li><code>std::num::TryFromIntError</code></li>\n<li><code>std::str::Utf8Error</code><br>\nand then applying specialized logic to translate each of those into <code>Errno</code>s.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>wasi_common::ErrorExt</code> trait provides human-friendly constructors for the <code>wasi_common::ErrorKind</code> variants .</p>\n<p>If you throw an error that does not downcast to one of those, it will turn into a <code>wiggle::Trap</code> and terminate execution.</p>\n<p>The real value of using <code>anyhow::Error</code> here is being able to use <code>anyhow::Result::context</code> to aid in debugging of errors.</p>\n<h2>The <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> implementation of the WASI traits</h2>\n<p>The <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> crate provides impl of <code>WasiFile</code> and <code>WasiDir</code> in terms of <code>cap_std::fs::{File, Dir}</code>. These types provide sandboxed access to the local filesystem on both Unix and Windows.</p>\n<p>The entire design story of <code>cap-std</code> is much bigger than we can address here, but in short, its functionality replaces all of the <code>wasi_common::sys</code> hierarchy, as well as the <code>yanix</code> / <code>winx</code> crates. All syscalls are hidden behind the <code>cap-std</code> hierarchy, with the lone exception of the <code>sched</code> implementation, which is provided for both unix and windows in separate modules. </p>\n<p>Any <code>wasi_common::{WasiCtx, WasiCtxBuilder}</code> is interoperable with the <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> crate. However, for convenience, <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> provides its own <code>WasiCtxBuilder</code> that hooks up to all of the crate's components, i.e. it fills in all of the arguments to <code>WasiCtx::builder(...)</code>, presents <code>preopen_dir</code> in terms of <code>cap_std::fs::Dir</code>, and provides convenience methods for inheriting the parent process's stdio, args, and env.</p>\n<p>The only place we expect to run into long-term compatibility issues between <code>wasi-cap-std-sync</code> and the other impl crates that will come later is in the <code>Sched</code> abstraction. Once we can build an async scheduler based on Rust <code>Future</code>s, async impls will be able to interoperate, but the synchronous scheduler depends on downcasting the <code>WasiFile</code> type down to concrete types it knows about (which in turn impl <code>AsRawFd</code> for passing to unix <code>poll</code>, or the analogous traits on windows).</p>\n<p>Why is this impl suffixed with <code>-sync</code>? <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2434\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2434</a> async is coming soon! The async impl may end up depending on tokio or other relatively heavy deps, so we will retain a sync implementation so that wasi-common users have an option of not pulling in an async runtime.</p>\n<h1>Improving the WASI test suite</h1>\n<p>The bulk of <code>wasi-common</code>'s test suite lives at <code>crates/test-programs</code>. This test suite was extremely useful for guiding this rewrite. We improved the test suite in numerous ways, including</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breaking tests out into smaller units, so that failing behavior can be isolated more easily</li>\n<li>Introducing a scheme which allows the test runner to describe to the wasm code what behaviors to expect of the embedding. Behaviors which vary between platforms (e.g. <code>fd_allcoate</code> is impossible to faithfully implement on Windows and is not provided by MacOS) are communicated to the guest by environment variables, which in turn is available in the guest behind the global <code>TESTCONFIG</code> struct.</li>\n<li>Introducing the <code>assert_errno!</code> macro, which pretty-prints errnos by name rather than number in the error message. <code>assert_errno!</code> integrates with <code>TESTCONFIG</code> to specify which errno is expected on which platform. This allows the test source to describe the full set of acceptable errnos a call may return (all possible errnos will be acceptable if no <code>ERRNO_MODE_*</code> env var is set), and also detect regressions on any given platform.</li>\n<li>We still use <code>crates/test-platforms/build.rs</code> to generate the test suite, and use functions directly in <code>build.rs</code> to describe the <code>TESTCONFIG</code> expectations, as well as which tests are to be ignored (expected to fail due to regressions) on what platforms.</li>\n<li>The test suite has been generalized to support multiple backends to the <code>wasi-common</code> crate. <br>\n[message truncated]</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
