In the context of Wasmtime, however, we know that all objects produced are 64-bit ELF files so there's no need to pull in, for example, a COFF parser as that'll always return an error anyway. This commit switches uses of the <code>object::File</code> convenience to <code>ElfFile64</code> instead.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
