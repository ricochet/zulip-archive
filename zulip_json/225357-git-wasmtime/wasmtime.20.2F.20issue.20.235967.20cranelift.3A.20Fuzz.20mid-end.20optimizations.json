The idea here is that instead of calling <code>run_in_host</code>, we'd call <code>run_in_interpreter</code> a second time, but the CLIF we'd pass it would be the result of running mid-end optimizations.</p>\n<p>For <code>cranelift-fuzzgen</code> to decide whether to use <code>run_in_host</code> or to optimize and run in the interpreter instead, we need to add a <code>bool</code> field to <code>TestCase</code>, and set that in <code>TestCase::generate</code> from the result of calling <code>gen.u.arbitrary()</code>.</p>\n<p>To get the optimized functions, we need something like this, which I've more or less borrowed from <code>cranelift/filetests/src/test_optimize.rs</code>:</p>\n<p><div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">optimized</span>: <span class=\"nb\">Vec</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">Function</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">testcase</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">functions</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">iter</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">map</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">comp_ctx</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">cranelift_codegen</span>::<span class=\"n\">Context</span>::<span class=\"n\">for_function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">function</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">clone</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"n\">comp_ctx</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">optimize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"n\">testcase</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isa</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"n\">unwrap</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"n\">comp_ctx</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">func</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"p\">})</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">collect</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n</code></pre></div><br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
