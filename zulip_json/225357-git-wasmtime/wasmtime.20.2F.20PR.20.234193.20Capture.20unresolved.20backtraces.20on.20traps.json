A bisection pointed out #4183 as<br>\nthe cause and after re-reviewing I realized I forgot that we capture<br>\nunresolved backtraces by default (and don't actually resolve them<br>\nanywhere yet but that's a problem for another day) rather than resolved<br>\nbacktraces. This means that it's intended that we use<br>\n<code>Backtrace::new_unresolved</code> instead of <code>Backtrace::new</code> in the<br>\ntraphandlers crate.</p>\n<p>The reason that tests were running so slowly is that the tests which<br>\ndeal with deep stacks (e.g. stack overflow) would take forever in<br>\ntesting as the Rust-based decoding of DWARF information is egregiously<br>\nslow in unoptimized mode. I did discover independently that optimizing<br>\nthese dependencies makes the tests ~6x faster, but that's irrelevant if<br>\nwe're not symbolicating in the first place.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
