We always do something like <code>(alu_rrr (opcode) ...)</code>, I'm personally not a big fan of this, but I'm not sure how other people feel about this stuff.</p>\n<p>Also maybe we could get some sort of lisp formatter that would work for folks? Styles are different across all backends, It'd be nice to standardize on <em>something</em>. </p>\n<p>Maybe that is something for <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5752\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5752</a>, I'm not sure how far LSP goes.</p>\n</blockquote>",
