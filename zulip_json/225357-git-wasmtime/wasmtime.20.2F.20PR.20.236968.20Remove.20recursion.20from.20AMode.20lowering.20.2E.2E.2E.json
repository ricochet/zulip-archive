On the x64 backend this can lead to stack overflow on the host given wasm inputs during compilation due to the fact that <code>i32.add</code> goes through this path of lowering (e.g. trying to use the <code>lea</code> instruction). The recursion in these rules are rewritten to hunt for constants differently in a non-recursive fashion which relies on egraph optimizations to place constants in the right place to get good code output.</p>\n<p>This PR additionally updates the AArch64 backend to remove the recursion there as well. While not reachable from wasm this is still reachable from Cranelift and is a good bug to fix regardless.</p>\n<p>Note that the stack overflow during compilation requires optimizations to be disabled, as otherwise egraphs will already fold constants together which means that recursion won't happen deeply.</p>\n<p>Thanks to DFINITY for notifying the <a href=\"mailto:security@bytecodealliance.org\">security@bytecodealliance.org</a> mailing list for this issue! We concluded this in the end wasn't a CVE-worthy issue because it requires non-default settings to trigger (e.g. disabling optimizations). This is something I'll backport to the 13 release branch, however.</p>\n</blockquote>",
