These appear to have copy/paste typos where the non-register-based opcodes weren't updated from the <code>add</code> and <code>sub</code> opcodes. This problem was exposed from a fuzz test case after #9136 landed. The fuzz test case is minimized and included here as a new runtest and new emit tests are additionally added.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
