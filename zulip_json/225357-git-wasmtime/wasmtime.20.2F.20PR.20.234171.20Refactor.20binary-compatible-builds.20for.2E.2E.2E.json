Along<br>\n  with custom toolchain things this could all get removed since the C we<br>\n  include now is quite simple.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The aarch64 and s390x cross-compiled builds had relatively high glibc<br>\n  version requirements compared to the x86_64 build. This was because we<br>\n  don't use a container to build the cross-compiled binaries. I added<br>\n  containers here along the lines of the x86_64 build to use an older<br>\n  glibc to build the release binary to lower our version requirement.<br>\n  This lower the aarch64 version requirement from glibc 2.28 to 2.17.<br>\n  Additionally the s390x requirement dropped from 2.28 to 2.16.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To make the containers a bit easier to read/write I added<br>\n<code>Dockerfile</code>s for them in a new <code>ci/docker</code> directory instead of<br>\n  hardcoding install commands in JS.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This isn't intended to be a really big change or anything for anyone,<br>\nbut it's intended to keep our Linux-based builds consistent at least as<br>\nbest we can.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
