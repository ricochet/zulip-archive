For example, when an I128 is represented using two 64-bit registers, either of those registers may be spilled independently.</p>\n<p>As a result, the <code>load_spillslot</code>/<code>store_spillslot</code> helpers were more general than necessary, which in turn required extra complexity in the <code>gen_load_stack_multi</code>/<code>gen_store_stack_multi</code> helpers. None of these helpers were used in any other context, so all that complexity was unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Inlining all four helpers and then simplifying eliminates a lot of code without changing the output of the compiler.</p>\n<p>These helpers were also the only uses of <code>StackAMode::offset</code>, so I've deleted that. While I was there, I also deleted <code>StackAMode::get_type</code>, which was introduced in #8151 and became unused again in #8246.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think this is leftover generality from a previous version of multi-reg handling; indeed we don't seem to need it anymore. I'm having a little trouble remembering whether the <code>_multi</code> variants were useful for arm32 previously (e.g., stack args); I suspect the rest of the ABI machinery should work without this though, so let's clean up and cross other bridges later :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",
