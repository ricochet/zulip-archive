We talked a bit about how host info is useful becuase it has the same lifetime of the <code>ExternRef</code>, but I'm not actually seeing where that happens? If you <code>set_host_info</code> for something, I don't see a destructor of <code>ExternRef</code> which the calls the finalizer when the <code>ExternRef</code> goes away. (I think this just happens when the <code>Store</code> goes away?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, this is why it is useful at the API level. Our implementation doesn't do that yet <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span> </p>\n</blockquote>",
