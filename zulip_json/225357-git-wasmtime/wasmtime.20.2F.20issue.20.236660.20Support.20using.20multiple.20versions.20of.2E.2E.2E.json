That being said the implementation of this needs to be balanced with maintainability at the same time. For example if a release checklist was \"go on <code>main</code> and update a bunch of symbols\" I don't think would work well, but having something more automatic (e.g. adding a suffix as you suggest) would work well. A suffix implementation, however, is likely to be somewhat nontrivial but still not outside the realm of feasability if you're interested in tackling it.</p>\n<p>It's worth pointing out that <code>wasmtime-fiber</code> \"correctly\" has a <code>links</code> which says \"there can only be one copy of this\". It looks like <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> _incorrectly_ does not have a <code>links</code>. I would not recommend using <code>cargo:rustc-link-arg=-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition</code> as that is more likely to produce a broken binary than a working one. Duplicate symbols are not guaranteed to have the same behavior, and overwriting one with a different version would almost certainly cause the resulting binary to break.</p>\n<p>Some places I can think of off the top of my head to handle a version suffix are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any invocation of <code>asm_func!</code> as a macro, including those in <code>wasmtime-fiber</code> and <code>crates/runtime/src/trampolines/*.rs</code></li>\n<li>As you've pointed out the external s390x assembly file (there's one for fibers as well)</li>\n<li>As you've pointed out, the <code>crates/runtime/src/debug_builtins.rs</code> file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For all the assembly trampolines that can all be fixed by suffixing symbols with the crate's current version number. For the debug builtins I think it would be best to probably turn off that file by default and have it be opt-in, since I don't think it's really well supported anywhere today anyway.</p>\n<p>Would you be interested in working on a scheme to suffix the assembly symbols with the crate's current version?</p>\n</blockquote>",
