Right now Rust has loongarch64-unknown-linux-gnu and loongarch64-unknown-linux-musl targets thanks to LLVM. I wonder if its support is even planned in cranelift.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>loongarch64 is already supported by Rust compiler - most crates you can compile to loongarch64 on loongarch64. One of exceptions to this general rule is the Zellij. It depends on the cranelift-codegen internally.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>TODO: Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>\nalgorithms to use?</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>TODO: What are the alternative implementation approaches or alternative ways to<br>\nsolve the problem that this feature would solve? How do these alternatives<br>\ncompare to this proposal?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

I might try doing something. Although I'm pretty much sure that time requirements multiplied by my skill gap will result in too much time for porting one of terminal multiplexers (and creating cranelift backend in the process :D). But we'll see</p>\n</blockquote>",
