Further, mobile networks have been using IPv6-only through NAT64 and 464XLAT for much longer.</p>\n<p>However, while IPv6-only networks are widely popular, IPv6-only OSes and kernels have not had the same luck, mainly due to ABI compatibility concerns. Thankfully, WASI does not currently share those concerns, putting it in a perfect spot to bring this change forward.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>The wasi-sockets implementation would be IPv6-only, and it would recognize the special NAT64 prefix <code>64::ff9b::/96</code> and treat it appropriately. On IPv6-only networks it would simply route those connections to the appropriate NAT64 gateway, while on dual-stack <strong>and IPv4-only</strong> networks it would unwrap them over the host IPv4 network. The toolchain (wasi-sdk, emscripten, etc) would have to provide its own CLAT-like functionality, a so-called \"CLAT-in-libc\".</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>\"Doing nothing for now\" is an option, but it does mean paying the cost of an IPv4 API deprecation cycle later.</p>\n</blockquote>",
