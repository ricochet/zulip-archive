In the end I'd like to remove or update the <code>memory_pages</code> configuration in the pooling allocator to being bytes of linear memory instead to be more consistent with <code>Config</code> (and additionally anticipate the custom-page-sizes wasm proposal where terms-of-pages will become ambiguous). The first step in this change is to update one of the lowest layered usages of pages, the <code>MemoryStyle::Static</code> configuration.</p>\n<p>Note that this is not a trivial conversion because the purpose of carrying around pages instead of bytes is that bytes may overflow where overflow-with-pages typically happens during validation. This means that extra care is taken to handle errors related to overflow to ensure that everything is still reported at the same time.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
