This error code is unexpected by wasi-libc and causes wasi-libc to abort. The PR here is to instead return <code>ERRNO_BADF</code> which is indeed expected by wasi-libc and is recognized as meaning \"that prestat isn't available\".</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
