Nevertheless this reduces the scope of unsafety slightly as was originally intended.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

But since this was passing CI before, I guess that nothing was depending on <code>PrePatchedFuncRef</code> being <code>Send</code> or <code>Sync</code>, so do we need those at all? Could these <code>unsafe impl</code>s just be deleted instead?</p>\n</blockquote>",
