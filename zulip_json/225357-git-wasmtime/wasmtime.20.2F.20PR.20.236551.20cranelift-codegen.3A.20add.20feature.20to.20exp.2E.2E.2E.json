Given a situation where you have two dependencies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One depends on cranelift aarch64 codegen, so it enables the <code>aarch64</code> feature.</li>\n<li>The other depends on cranelift native codegen, so it does not enable any arch feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the additive property of features, cranelift-codegen will be built with the <code>aarch64</code> feature for both dependencies (assuming they use the same cranelift version), so the native ISA will not be included (unless it is aarch64).</p>\n<p>With the <code>host-arch</code> feature added here, the native host ISA can now be explicitly requested without risk of another crate of the dependency tree disabling it.</p>\n<p>The native ISA is still enabled when none is explicitly enabled, although I think that this behaviour should be deprecated. <br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
