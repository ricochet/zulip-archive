But I assume the abstraction is not right yet. The <code>MachInst</code> trait shouldn't contain references to implementation details of a specific backend.</p>\n<p>If the <code>MachInst</code> trait had some method <code>gen_imm_f64</code>, what should it return? Just one of the existing instructions is not enough, I think, because a single instruction for immediate f64 values doesn't exist? And returning something like <code>Option&lt;(Self, Self)&gt;</code> also seems like a leaky abstraction.</p>\n<p>@cfallin maybe you have an idea for the right abstraction here?</p>\n</blockquote>",
