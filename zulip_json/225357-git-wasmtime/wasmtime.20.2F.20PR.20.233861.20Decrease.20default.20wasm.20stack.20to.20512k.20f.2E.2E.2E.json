In decreasing<br>\nthe default wasm stack size a test is also update to probe for less<br>\nstack to work on Windows' main thread by default, ideally allowing the<br>\nfull test suite to work with <code>--test-threads 1</code> (although this isn't<br>\nadded to CI as it's not really critical).</p>\n<p>Closes #3857</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
