The new behavior is the intended behavior, at least for now. The intended behavior of the rights system was never written down, and varies widely between implementations, so its hard to say exactly what the right thing to do here is - only allowing base rights always be a subset of those inherited seemed like a reasonable design choice, though.</p>\n<p>FWIW, our current thinking is that the rights system doesn't actually do very much for wasi's filesystem and we should get rid of it in favor of a pair of bits for read &amp; write permission, and let any finer-grained access control be implemented by virtualization of the filesystem interface, which will be possible (in pure wasm) one day soon. We're waiting on virtualization to be possible via the new-abi work upstream in the standards repo before tearing out the rights system completely.</p>\n</blockquote>",
