This is known as <a href=\"https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch05.pdf#G21790\">caseless matching</a> in Unicode parlance, which is fast and vectorizable.</p>\n<p>Wine and Samba run into issues with deeply nested directories: <code>/foo/bar/readme.txt</code>, <code>/Foo/bar/readme.txt</code>.   But that's because they are providing a compatibility layer for unmodified binaries.  In our case, we could just throw an error when there are multiple casefolded matches.  </p>\n</blockquote>",
