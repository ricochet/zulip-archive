I am currently also using the workaround of manually copying the macro crate's code so that I can modify the outcoming <code>TokenStream</code>, for example <a href=\"https://github.com/kajacx/wasm-bridge/blob/master/crates/wasm-bridge-macros/src/lib.rs#L32\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I have already created <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6690\">this issue</a> in the past, but was closed. I think @alexcrichton didn't understand what I wanted, so let me re-iterate:</p>\n<p>All that we are asking for is that the <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime-component-macro/10.0.1/wasmtime_component_macro/\"><code>wasmtime_component_macro</code></a> (and the wit-bindgen equivalent for the guest) is split into two: one that exports the macros as normal functions with <code>TokenStream -&gt; TokenStream</code> signatures, and a second crate that just re-exports those functions as proc macros.</p>\n<p>That's all. I don't expect any support in terms of \"stability\" of the resulting code from the macro or anything like that.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I apologize if you felt misunderstood, but I feel like I understand what you're saying and asking for and what I'm trying to explain is why it may seem like a simple ask it's not as simple as it appears on the surface and I don't think is something we should take on maintaining.</p>\n<p>The more \"public surface area\" of Wasmtime that folks use the more we inevitably get pushback when making changes or issues whenever changes are made. These aren't something we are really planning on maintaining beyond the interfaces that are intended.</p>\n<p>My recommendation is still to either (a) copy and vendor the sources yourself to take on the maintenance burden yourselves or (b) work on integrating these features upstream here in Wasmtime.</p>\n</blockquote>",

From your perspective I agree that it's less work for you and doesn't seem too add much maintenance on the project.</p>\n<p>From Wasmtime's perspective, however, there's a few issues in my opinion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There's no reason for this split in the sense that if someone changes it there's no test that will fail or reason to keep it the way it is. This means that it can change at any time, and a request in the future to change it back to the way it was is, in my opinion, maintenance.</li>\n<li>You may not be the only user of this feature. While you may be willing to update when Wasmtime changes others may be less willing and may open issues here asking for guidance in updating, request that changes be backed out, or something like that.</li>\n<li>More generally even if users use a feature like this and update just fine there may be subtle runtime or other issues which aren't predicted since we, the maintainers of wasmtime, aren't necessarily going into this eyes open. This means that subtle issues may arise into our issue queue which we then debug and spend time on which end up bottoming out in code elsewhere we can't do much about.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Personally I'd prefer to avoid these situations. I understand that the distinctions I'm making are subtle and somewhat hand-wavy as well. To be clear I'm just one maintainer here and there are many others, so if others are willing to help you carry through a change like this I'm happy to hand it off to them.</p>\n</blockquote>",
