This is due to (not great) API design in <code>wasmparser</code> (introduced by me) where wasmparser by default won't read 64-bit offsets unless explicitly allowed to. This is to handle how spec tests assert that overlong 32-bit encodings are invalid as the memory64 proposal isn't merged into the spec yet.</p>\n<p>The fix here is to call <code>allow_memarg64</code> with whether memory64 is enabled or not and then that'll enable reading these overlong and/or larger offsets correctly.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
