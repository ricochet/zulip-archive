Emitting separate instructions instead of a single meta-instruction gets us back to the very problem the meta-instruction is intended to avoid: we'd need to create branches (and their target labels), which we cannot do since we cannot modify the CFG at this point.   And even if could do that somehow, we'd also have to model the loop <em>dataflow</em> correctly: it's not just that we're writing to a register, it is that this register is a loop-carried dependency - so if we split out separate instructions, we'd have to create a new PHI node to correctly represent that ...</p>\n<p>In any case, the restriction to hard registers works out fine for this use case on s390x (and I don't really foresee any other use cases): we need to have %r0 and %r1 as reserved registers anyway for various reasons, and using those two actually reduces register pressure in the CAS loop, which already needs quite a few of them.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This practice of meta-instructions that contain mini-CFGs (always with a single-in single-out property, modulo traps) has been our solution so far, and we have some other examples in aarch64 atomics (CAS loops), divides (special-case checks and traps), br_tables (bounds checks), and maybe a few others. Maybe we could loosen this in the future if we think we might want opts after lowering that could make use of visibility into the instructions.</p>\n<p>FWIW elsewhere we've mostly done this in a way that is specific to each use-case rather than a generic combinator (loop with \"body\" field) but if that's what works here, I'm not really opposed to it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
