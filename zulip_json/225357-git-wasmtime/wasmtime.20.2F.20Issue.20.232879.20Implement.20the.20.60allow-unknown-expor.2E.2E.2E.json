If modules start being used widely that export functions under names that future standards might want to use, then we'd risk behavior changing in weird and unexpected ways, so we'd likely be forced to choose different names.</p>\n<p>This isn't a theoretical concern either: it's <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Array.prototype.includes#status\">the reason</a> why <code>{String, Array}.prototype.includes}</code> isn't called <code>contains</code>, to give just one example.</p>\n</blockquote>",
