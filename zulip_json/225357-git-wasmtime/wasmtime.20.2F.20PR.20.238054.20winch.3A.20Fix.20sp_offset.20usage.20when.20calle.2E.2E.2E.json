To fix this, we now reset the internal stack offset to <code>0</code> after the prologue, to ensure that we're skipping the callee save space. The prologue stack offset is restored for the epilogue, ensuring that the prologue and epilogue have a consistent view of the state of the stack when they run.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

That would match winch's existing calling convention, and would avoid the problems this PR solves in a different way, as we wouldn't have any trampolines in winch, which is what introduces the issues with <code>address_from_sp</code> in the first place.</p>\n</blockquote>",
