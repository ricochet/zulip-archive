We're hitting CI hard today so this probably won't get a chance for the CI checks to run for a while, but I'm setting it to auto-merge once that passes. Thanks for your efforts on this!</p>\n<p>I think I understand why fuzzing didn't catch the misuse of <code>ListPool</code>: since you created a new pool, all the values in your <code>ValueList</code>s had small indexes (0..3) into the pool, and it's not so surprising that those were valid indexes into the DFG's pool as well. Or something like that.</p>\n</blockquote>",
