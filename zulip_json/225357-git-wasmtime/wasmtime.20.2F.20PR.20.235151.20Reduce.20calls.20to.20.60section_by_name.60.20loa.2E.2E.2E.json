To avoid doing this linear search every time I've replaced this with one loop over the sections of an object at the beginning when an object is loaded, or at least most of the calls with this loop.</p>\n<p>This isn't really a pressing issue today but some upcoming work I hope to do for AOT-compiled components will be adding more sections to the artifact so it seems best to keep the number of linear searches small and avoided if possible.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

But I don't see any easy way to get the max <code>SectionId</code> value.</p>\n<p>I think this condition would read more clearly to me if flipped (<code>if idx &gt;= dwarf_sections.len()</code>). But I always have to think about this kind of condition either way, so I don't feel strongly about it.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I wasn't worried about inefficiency of resizing the vector. This <code>if</code> condition was the only bit I had to stop to think about, and also the only place where you had a bug caught by CI. So it would be nice if we could pre-size the array to avoid having to think about the correctness of this <code>if</code> statement. But there doesn't appear to be a good way to do that, and after all CI _did_ catch the bug, so the way you have it is probably the best option.</p>\n</blockquote>",
