This commit is a refactoring of these two types with the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The payload of these types is now unsigned and guarantees that irrelevant bits are set to zero. For example <code>Imm12</code> is stored as <code>u16</code> where the upper four bits are guaranteed to be zero. This fixes a discrepancy where <code>Imm12::maybe_from_i64</code> was masked for example but <code>Imm12::from_bits</code> wasn't.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>Neg for Imm12</code> impl was removed because -2048 is a valid <code>Imm12</code> but 2048 is not in-range for <code>Imm12</code> meaning that it is not an infallible operation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accessors are now named <code>bits</code> to get the <code>u32</code> representation suitable to be encoded into an instruction. Acquiring the underlying value is now done with <code>as_i{16,32}</code> depending on the type. The signed accessor does sign-extension as required to produce the semantically equivalent value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Manual constructors were renamed to <code>from_{i16,i32}</code> instead of <code>from_bits</code>. This in theory helps convey that they're constructors for logical values rather than literal bit-wise values. Additionally asserts are now placed in these constructors asserting that the provided value is in-range.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>FALSE</code> and <code>TRUE</code> constants were renamed <code>ZERO</code> and <code>ONE</code> and <code>Imm20::ZERO</code> was added.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This commit ended up changing many runtests, but only their CLIF printing rather than their encoding. This change is due to the fact that <code>Display</code> now prints the logical value of the immediate rather than the raw bit representation as a base 10 integer. It's not intended that this commit actually changes any behavior, instead it should purely be internal refactorings.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
