For OpenGL I have no control over how the GPU upload buffer memory is allocated and as such would always need a copy. For Vulkan there is an exception, but can't blindly assume it's possible to get memory from wasm and use it right in vulkan for buffer upload.[^vk_exception]</p>\n<p>As a result of these limitations I would need to do a copy anyways.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>The proposed API could look something like this (in Rust)</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">impl</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Memory</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">unsafe</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">import_memory</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">store</span>: <span class=\"nc\">impl</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">AsContextMut</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ty</span>: <span class=\"nc\">MemoryType</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">pointer</span>: <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"nb\">Result</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">Memory</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This would be an unsafe API since the wasm runtime would need exclusive access of the memory (which can't really be guaranteed on every platform). Also the caller must ensure the pointer is valid as long as wasm is able to access that memory.</p>\n<p>Because the memory was allocated by the host, wasmtime can't resize the memory itself. This means that <code>Memory::grow</code> would need to unconditionally fail. What I'm not sure about is freeing a <code>Memory</code> instance from the host. This would probably also be unsafe.</p>\n<p>There is also the question of whether wasmtime can architecturally handle this type of API without some internal reworks.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>I can't think up any other alternatives to this problem except for additional copies. The fact that the graphics API must allocate memory </p>\n<p>[^vk_exception]: For Vulkan it is possible to use <code>VK_EXT_external_memory_host</code>. This however comes with some restrictions: alignment being the main one (which is probably fine given wasm needs 64k blocks of memory). However not every hardware vendor can implement that extension. Intel, Broadcom and Qualcomm seem to be incapable of supporting it while some older AMD and Nvidia hardware can't implement it.</p>\n</blockquote>",

There's a number of requirements about the behavior of a wasm linear memory which make it not necessarily easy to do something like this.</p>\n</blockquote>",
