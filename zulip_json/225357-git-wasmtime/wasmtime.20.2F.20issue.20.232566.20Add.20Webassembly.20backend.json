It could serve either as the model for, or as a codegen library for, a WebAssembly backend for Cranelift. It currently requires reducible control flow (will panic when given an irreducible CFG) but this is \"just\" an implementation question, as the API is based on a standard CFG. The crate has been fuzzed with roundtrip + differential execution and is in a fairly robust state (can roundtrip complex Wasms like SpiderMonkey).</p>\n<p>The main challenge that remains is in the semantic gap between Wasm and CLIF: lowering loses information about tables, heaps, globals and the like, and we would need to \"lift\" CLIF's raw memory accesses back to Wasm-level concepts. That's maybe not so bad though: one could use a \"null\" environment when lowering the Wasm, leaving heap accesses to memory zero as-is (address computation is the identity function), and then compile accesses to raw memory in CLIF back to accesses to a single Wasm memory. Function pointers (taking the address of symbols) will require some care. Also, CLIF is not exactly 1-to-1 with Wasm opcodes, especially the SIMD ones. But, doable. This is probably a 1-2 month project for someone at this point.</p>\n</blockquote>",

One raw address space goes to one Wasm memory, and all function pointers are indices into one table, with entries populated as we observe function-address operators. I guess there is just the question of \"relocations\" for external symbol references.)</p>\n</blockquote>",
