Factoring that out and making sure to use it everywhere that constraints and bindings are created ensures that these will always stay in sync. It also simplifies the implementation of <code>normalize_equivalence_classes</code>, which needs to create bindings for constraints but doesn't care what they are.</p>\n<p>Also make <code>add_pattern_constraints</code> non-recursive and reuse allocations.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Since we're inside islec and performance is not extremely critical, could we return a <code>Vec&lt;Binding&gt;</code> here? Then one could do a <code>match self { Constraint::ConstInt { .. } =&gt; vec![], Constraint::Some =&gt; vec![source], ... }</code> instead. Likewise this would avoid the need to iterate over the tuple index (above).</p>\n</blockquote>",
