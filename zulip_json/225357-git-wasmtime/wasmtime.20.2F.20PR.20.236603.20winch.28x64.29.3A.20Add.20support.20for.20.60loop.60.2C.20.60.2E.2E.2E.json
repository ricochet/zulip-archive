Whenever an instruction that affects reachability is emitted (<code>br</code> in the case of this PR), the compiler will enter into an unreachable code state, essentially ignoring most of the subsequent instructions. When handling the unreachable code state some instructions are still observed, in order to determine if reachability should be restored.</p>\n<p>This change, particulary the handling of unreachable code, adds all the necessary building blocks to the compiler to emit other instructions that affect reachability (e.g <code>unreachable</code>, <code>return</code>).</p>\n<p>I decided to bundle these instructions together to be able to test more complex scenarios with <code>loop</code>, but I'm happy to split this change into two (or more). </p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

We <em>could</em> put the logic back into <code>visit_*</code> for cases where both reachable and unreachable have handlers (e.g. control-flow and <code>end</code>) and, at the top of every \"irrelevant in unreachable code\" op, do a <code>if self.context.unreachable { return Ok(()); }</code> or wrap that in a <code>skip_if_unreachable!();</code> macro or something. @saulecabrera what do you think?</p>\n</blockquote>",

One thing that I like of the current approach, is that the handling of unreachable code is isolated and should only be updated if there's a need to deal with such state while handling the unreachable code state in each visitor function is a bit more manual and error prone, but in the spirit of more explicit code I think that's fine. </p>\n</blockquote>",
