By then placing the default target as the last entry in the table, we can use just one branch instruction in all cases.</p>\n<p>This is a net savings of two bytes in the encoding of x64's br_table pseudoinstruction.</p>\n<p>I haven't done any benchmarking yet. I'm guessing either this will be faster because it doesn't branch as often, or it will be slower because it executes more instructions in the common case where the bounds check succeeds.</p>\n<p>I also haven't updated the comments in the implementation because first I wanted to see if this works at all (it passes the test suite!) and whether folks have strong arguments for or against this change.</p>\n<p>It's just a random idea I had and thought I'd try out.</p>\n</blockquote>",
