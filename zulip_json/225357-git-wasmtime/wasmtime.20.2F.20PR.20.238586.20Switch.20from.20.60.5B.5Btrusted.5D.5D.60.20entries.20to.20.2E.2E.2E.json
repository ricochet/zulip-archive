Previously Wasmtime/wasm-tools crates were flagged as <code>[[wildcard-audits]]</code> but now being changed to all using <code>wasmtime-publish</code> to publish crates the <code>[[trusted]]</code> entries were added at the recommendation of <code>cargo vet</code>. This means that other organizations could no longer import our own audits since <code>[[trusted]]</code> entries aren't imported, only suggested.</p>\n<p>This commit changes all these entries to <code>wildcard-audits</code> with an explanation as to why.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
