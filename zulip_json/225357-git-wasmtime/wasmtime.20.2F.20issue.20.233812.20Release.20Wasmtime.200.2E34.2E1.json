The <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/1854676029\">CI build for 0.34.1</a> had artifacts for Linux I manually uploaded <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v0.34.1\">to the release</a>, but unfortunately we also don't have Windows artifacts due to the job being cancelled which hopefully <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3832\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3832</a> will address in the future. If that's an issue though we can delete the release and re-run the build to get artifacts again.</p>\n</blockquote>",
