Currently today we have no automated checks for vendoring and re-vendoring requires hand-editing. To help incrementally improve this situation this commit adds a script to do all the vendoring for us. This way CI can verify that everything is generated with respect to the output of this script.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
