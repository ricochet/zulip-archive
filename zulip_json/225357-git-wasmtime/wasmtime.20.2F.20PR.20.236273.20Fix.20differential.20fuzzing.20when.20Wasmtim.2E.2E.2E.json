This meant that the two modules were producing \"different results\" since memories had differing lengths, but this isn't a failure we're interested in. This commit updates the differential fuzzer to discard the test case once the Wasmtime half reaches OOM.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
