(As an aside, why aren't we using SSE2's <code>PSLLDQ</code>/<code>PSRLDQ</code> instructions instead of these long sequences? I haven't looked at much of the i128 code but it would seem that moving upper and lower halves to XMMs and back might still be faster for one of these cases?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ah, the simple answer is that I don't know SSE well enough to reach for such instructions -- though it looks like they should work much more efficiently than these sequences! I'll go ahead and merge with your +1 for now so that we have correct results; but we can definitely improve this later. Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
