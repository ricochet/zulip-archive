(Note for other reviewers, this PR is based on #6140 so at the moment only <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6141/commits/8d4cf54be4460c3a11e6c078b449c1665326c365\">ISLE: simplify select/bitself when both choices are the same</a> is necessary to review here.)</p>\n<p>I'd like to double-check with @cfallin that these new rules are correct, but I think they are. I don't think there's any subtlety to <code>select</code> or <code>bitselect</code> that would make this optimization invalid.</p>\n<p>I think this particular optimization might even be legal for <code>select_spectre_guard</code>, although that definitely has subtlety and also I wouldn't expect such a rule to ever fire.</p>\n<p>There's a typo in the commit message and PR description (\"bitself\"â†’\"bitselect\") but once #6140 lands and this PR is rebased, I think this is a fine change.</p>\n</blockquote>",
