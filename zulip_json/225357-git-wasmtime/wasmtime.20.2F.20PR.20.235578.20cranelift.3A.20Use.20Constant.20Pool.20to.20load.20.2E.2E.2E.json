We only do this in the case where we can't simply use a <code>lui</code> / <code>addi</code> instruction to get the right constant.</p>\n<p>It also adds a Label based addressing mode for loads and stores.</p>\n<p>Fixes #5569</p>\n<p>My understanding of this issue is that a veneer would be emitted right in the middle of a LoadConst sequence and since we used hardcoded relative offsets, these would break and point to the wrong location. Switching to a label based system prevents this kinds of issues.</p>\n</blockquote>",
