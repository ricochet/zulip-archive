This is triggered<br>\nwith some new directives in the <code>[features]</code> section, specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>dep:foo</code> syntax means that <code>foo</code> is activated but no implicit<br>\n  feature should be added named <code>foo</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additionally <code>foo?/bar</code> means that the <code>bar</code> feature of <code>foo</code> is only<br>\n  activated if <code>foo</code> is otherwise activated elsewhere, for example a<br>\n  conditional activation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These two features can help avoid extra feature names showing up that we<br>\ndon't want (e.g. currently the <code>wasmtime</code> crate has a <code>rayon</code> feature)<br>\nand additionally can help avoid runtime dependencies in niche cases for<br>\nus (e.g. activating <code>all-arch</code> but disabling <code>cranelift</code> would<br>\npreviously pull-in cranelift but no longer will).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
