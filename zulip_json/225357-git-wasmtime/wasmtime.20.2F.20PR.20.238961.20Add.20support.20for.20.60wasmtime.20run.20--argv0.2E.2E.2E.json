This flag is used to override the inferred value of the first argument which is sometimes used to dispatch on various pieces of functionality. This enables avoiding the need to copy around wasm files.</p>\n<p>Closes #8955</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
