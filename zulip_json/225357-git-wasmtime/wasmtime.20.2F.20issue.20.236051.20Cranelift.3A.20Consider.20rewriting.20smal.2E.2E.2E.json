A tree of conditional branches may also be safe (I'm not aware of any CPUs that feed data from speculative execution back into the direction predictor) but we'd have to be sure.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The only exceptions are when there are no cases (which just jumps to the default case) or when there's exactly one case (which generates a <code>brif</code> to choose between the case and the default). So that isn't as helpful as it looks.</p>\n<p>I think I'd weakly argue against doing this during lowering, because I think that will impede branch optimization. As long as we represent the search tree explicitly in CLIF, the block lowering order will be able to see that control flow and have the opportunity to fuse jump-target blocks into the tree. If we use pseudo-instructions then the branches will be emitted too late for that.</p>\n</blockquote>",
