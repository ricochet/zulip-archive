The CLI flags/knobs for networking has been sort of ad-hoc so far. Right now it's <code>-S inherit-network</code> which enables doing anything and then there's separately <code>-S allow-ip-name-lookup</code>. Both knobs primarily only exist to disable things by default, though. </p>\n<p>Given that I'd actually say this should be left as-is. I dont think it should be verbose to opt-in to things and despite TCP/UDP being enabled by default they still won't work unless <code>-S inherit-network</code> is passed. In the future we can probably figure out how to unify this with name lookups.</p>\n</blockquote>",
