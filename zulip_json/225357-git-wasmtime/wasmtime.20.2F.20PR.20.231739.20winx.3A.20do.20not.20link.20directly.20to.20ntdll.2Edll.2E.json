The documentation for <code>NtQueryInformationFile</code> does not, but similar considerations apply because there is normally no import library for <code>ntdll</code>.</p>\n<p>The main reason to use <code>GetProcAddress</code> though is because MinGW does include an import library for <code>ntdll</code>, this import library contains a definition of <code>setjmp</code>, and because of the way rustc orders linker arguments, this definition of <code>setjmp</code> conflicts with and gets picked over the one in <code>msvcrt</code>. Using <code>setjmp</code> from ntdll is undesirable as it is an undocumented API and it is missing from wine, making it harder to develop wasmtime using a cross-compiler.</p>\n<p>Fixes #1738.</p>\n</blockquote>",
