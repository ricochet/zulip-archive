On my <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code> system the tests pass on <code>main</code> with Rust 1.61. The issue is with Rust <em>1.60</em>; i.e. CI didn't catch this because we're fine on latest stable but not version N-1.</p>\n<p>Generally our policy is that we only support latest stable, but it's a small enough tweak to a brittle error-string-matching test that I think we should still do it, and maybe it makes things a bit more robust in the future too.</p>\n</blockquote>",
