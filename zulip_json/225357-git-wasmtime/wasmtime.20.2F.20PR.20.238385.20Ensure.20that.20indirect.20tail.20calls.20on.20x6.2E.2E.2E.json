However, this also means that it's available to RA2 for allocation, and could end up holding the destination of a <code>return_call_indirect</code>. To fix this, I've added a temporary writable register to the x64 <code>ReturnCallInfo</code> structure, and marked it with an early def constraint to ensure that it won't conflict with the destination of an indirect call.<br>\n&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
