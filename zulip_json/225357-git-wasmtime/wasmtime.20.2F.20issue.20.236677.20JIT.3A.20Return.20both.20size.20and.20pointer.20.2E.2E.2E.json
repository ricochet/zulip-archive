Right now I dump them to standard output one byte at a time until my test program segfaults and manually locate the true end of the function code, which is unsustainable.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p><code>get_finalized_data</code> already works this way and seems to deal with the same type (<code>CompiledBlob</code>), so it should basically amount to copying that.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Adding a second function for getting the size would also work, but then the API would be inconsistent with itself.</p>\n</blockquote>",

You can also use <code>context.compiled_code().unwrap().code_info().total_size</code> to get the function length if you want to disassemble yourself.</p>\n<p>If that isn't enough for your use case, adding a length return value to get_finalized_function should be fine I guess. It would just be a bit noisy for the common case as you almost never need to know the size of a function. Just the address where you can call it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
