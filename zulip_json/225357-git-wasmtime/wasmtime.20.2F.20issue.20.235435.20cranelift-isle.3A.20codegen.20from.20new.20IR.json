I used the new <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/11/03/Rust-1.65.0.html#let-else-statements\">let-else syntax</a> in this PR, which stabilized last month in Rust 1.65. I could remove that syntax from this PR without much disappointment.</p>\n<p>The ubuntu-latest test failures tell me I forgot to run the ISLE tests, again. Most of those failures are due to integer constants that don't fit in their specified types, like what we discussed in #5423. There are also a couple hitting some asserts that I added at the last minute, so the asserts may be wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>",
