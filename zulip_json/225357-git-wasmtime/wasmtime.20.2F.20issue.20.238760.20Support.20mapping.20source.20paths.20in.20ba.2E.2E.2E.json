It'd be great to support this for Wasmtime backtraces, too.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>Making debugging of code compiled elsewhere easier.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>I'm not sure where exactly the search/replace would happen that'd lead to changed output. What I imagine for the user experience is something like a new (repeatable) CLI argument along the lines of <code>-D source-map [path-prefix]::[path]</code></p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Doing nothing</p>\n</blockquote>",
