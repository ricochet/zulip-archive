This <code>PATH</code> doesn't contain the directory you have installed wasmtime to if you didn't install is a root. There are two ways to fix the problem:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use <code>/path/to/wasmtime</code> instead of plain <code>wasmtime</code>. This may not be the best idea as this will run <code>wasmtime</code> as root, meaning that the wasm module will access any paths you allowed as <code>root</code>, with write permission.</li>\n<li>Run the command perf suggests when you don't run it as root. (you can replace the <code>-1</code> with <code>2</code> to give only the perf permissions that you need in this case to normal users) Then you can run perf as normal user without <code>sudo</code>. This is the safest way as <code>wasmtime</code> doesn't get any extra privileges.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>",
