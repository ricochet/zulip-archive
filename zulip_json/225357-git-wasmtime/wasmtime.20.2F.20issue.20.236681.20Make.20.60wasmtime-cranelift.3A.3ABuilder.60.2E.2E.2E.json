Have you ported Cranelift to this as well?

We don't support taking internal pieces of Wasmtime and invoking them in nonstandard ways, and we don't want there to be external dependencies on these aspects of our design, so I would say the private APIs are private for a reason. We'd be happy to try to help you reuse things in some other way though, if you can fill in some more detail.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If you are not using or porting Wasmtime, you don't want to use <code>wasmtime-cranelift</code>.</p>\n<p>Instead, <code>cranelift-wasm</code> is the crate (used by <code>wasmtime-cranelift</code>) that actually does the Wasm to CLIF translation. It requires some \"hooks\" to be filled in that are specific to the Wasm runtime the code will be running under.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to translate wasm to the binary code of a virtual machine, if it is possible to use cranelift to make it high quality and efficient?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe; it depends what sort of translation you want. Cranelift is an optimizing compiler, so if you want the Wasm -&gt; custom bytecode translation to do optimizations, you'll for sure get that. However it also makes a bunch of assumptions about the target architecture: it's really meant for \"real hardware\" ISAs like x86 or aarch64, and porting it to emit a custom bytecode may or may not be easy, depending on the bytecode's design. For example, Cranelift uses a register allocator and assumes that the target ISA has a fixed number of physical registers. If your bytecode is stack-based rather than register-based, that may be a problem.</p>\n<p>Porting Cranelift is also not easy (no compiler is really super-easy to retarget; \"real ISAs\" tend to be large). The initial PR to add support for RISC-V, our latest addition (#4271), was 21k lines of code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>does that mean that you have ported all of Wasmtime?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>nope, I just need the part wasm -&gt; cranelift IR with optimization</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Or instead are you mostly using the Cranelift pipeline (is this what you mean by \"wanna the 100% features of cranelift\"?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>for example, the stack limit check in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/crates/cranelift/src/compiler.rs#L150\">wasmtime-cranelift</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and getting at it via Wasmtime APIs?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>nope, I don't need wasmtime API and don't need to run the wasm in wasmtime or any other wasm runtimes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OK, yeah, given the above, using <code>wasmtime-cranelift</code> is definitely not the right answer. In fact the stack-limit check you link is closely related to Wasmtime's data structures (its <code>VMRuntimeLimits</code>) so if you're not actually using Wasmtime, it doesn't make any sense to use that implementation. You'll need to develop your own CLIF lowerings for Wasm features that target your own bytecode VM.</p>\n<p>I'll make a note on terminology here too: you need <em>some</em> \"runtime\" for the Wasm specifically, on top of your custom bytecode VM's runtime. In this context, \"runtime\" means support for Wasm semantics and state: for example, handling Wasm memories and tables. It could be a very simple mapping, but somehow you need to decide what a \"memory load\" or \"table set\" op becomes, and this is what you provide in your \"hooks\" to <code>cranelift-wasm</code>. <code>wasmtime-cranelift</code> provides code for all of this that assumes Wasmtime's data structures for memories, tables, function references, etc. exist. You'll need equivalents for all of these in order to run Wasm.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is \"EVM bytecode\"?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just the binary format for a virtual machine</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have you ported Cranelift to this as well?
