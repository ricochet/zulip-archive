However, capitals are a lot better at replicating the feel of a digital timepiece.</p>\n<p>I'm proposing three layouts</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Icon: just the logo</li>\n<li>Stacked: Icon with project name below</li>\n<li>Horizontal: Icon with project name to the right</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If people like it, I can also provide black (light mode), and white (dark mode) versions in PNG, JPG, and SVG.</p>\n<p>&lt;img width=\"811\" alt=\"wasmtime logo idea\" src=\"<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10812787/228952566-2514cbd2-3fa0-4c90-aa45-da512e36aa1e.png\">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10812787/228952566-2514cbd2-3fa0-4c90-aa45-da512e36aa1e.png</a>\"&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
