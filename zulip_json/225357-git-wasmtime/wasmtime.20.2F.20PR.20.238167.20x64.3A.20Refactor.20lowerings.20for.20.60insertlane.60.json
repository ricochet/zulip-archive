Upon adding the tests to <code>main</code> I see that most of it is actually implemented except for load-lane-from-memory where the lane size is 8 or 16 bits. That requires explicitly opting-in with <code>sinkable_load_exact</code> so this PR now subsumes the tests of #2716 in addition to implementing this missing hole in lowerings.</p>\n<p>This refactoring shuffles around where definitions are located to more easily have access to <code>Value</code> to perform the relevant match. The generic <code>vec_insert_lane</code> helper is now gone as well in lieu of direct matches on <code>insertlane</code> lowerings.</p>\n<p>Closes #2716</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
