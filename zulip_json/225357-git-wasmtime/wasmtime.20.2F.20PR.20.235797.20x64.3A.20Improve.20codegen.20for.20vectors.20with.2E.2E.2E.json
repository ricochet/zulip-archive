This I believe is the constant pool area and capstone is trying to decode it as instructions, but I don't know why after this change, which should generate a smaller constant pool, is generating more instructions here. I would hazard a guess that capstone automatically stoped beforehand for some reason and now it's keeping-on-going, but I'm not sure.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We've discussed ways to entirely quit trying to disassemble constants since we think the machbuffer knows where they are, but one step at a time.</p>\n</blockquote>",
