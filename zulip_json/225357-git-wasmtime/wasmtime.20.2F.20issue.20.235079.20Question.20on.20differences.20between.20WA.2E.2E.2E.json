WASI is being specified using an Interface Description Language (IDL), which means we can generate a variety off kinds of bindings or ABIs for it, which all represent the same logical interface or API. But that said, yes, you're right, WASI is just an API, or set of APIs, much like other APIs. The main thing that makes WASI APIs special is just that they're developed for standardization within a subgroup of the WebAssembly CG, the standards body for WebAssembly itself.</p>\n<p>Concerning the scope of WASI, there isn't anything special about filesystems or sockets or even being part of standard libraries of popular programming languages. We've even moved away from the term \"wasi-core\" as our understanding has evolved, because many popular use cases don't expect to make use of filesystems or sockets at all, so while it makes sense to have those APIs in WASI, they aren't any more fundamental than other APIs that use cases want.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the scope of WASI is just determined by the set of APIs that are useful to standardize in a standards body. That includes filesystems and sockets and other standard-library functionality, but it includes many other kinds of APIs too. We've recently added many exciting new proposals for things like <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-kv-store\">KV stores</a>, for example.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

So WASI will also standardize what are called Worlds, which are sets of APIs. A \"command\" World will include the filesystem and sockets and similar APIs, while other Worlds will contain other sets.</p>\n</blockquote>",
