I don't think I'm up for driving any changes to the existing toolchains to change how null pointers are represented, though. I do think it would be beneficial for C/C++ programs to trap when they try to dereference null, so I wouldn't object to any solution which makes that possible.</p>\n<p>I should have stated my motivation for this change up front more clearly - we (Fastly) are transitioning to use Wiggle to handle Wasm programs using all-zeroes for null pointers today, and especially want to avoid writing to pointers which those programs did not intend to be written to. Some of our implementation (unfortunately, closed source for now) predating Wiggle checked for null before using a pointer. I need to preserve that behavior somehow to keep programs working, and this seemed like the most straightforward way. It will change the behavior of wasi-common as well, but I don't believe that wasi-libc depends on this behavior presently.</p>\n</blockquote>",
