That seems to have a few more checks than <code>cargo package</code> and would have caught one failure condition from #8987. The missing categories failure condition can't be caught by Cargo right now without actually publishing, so that'll have to be left for a future fix on a future day.</p>\n<p>Closes #8987</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
