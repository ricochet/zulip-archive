I think the only way this could happen was that, during construction of these value label ranges, we'd<br>\n\"extend\" a range with the new end of an instruction, but the end of that<br>\ninstruction is located before the end of the range we're overwriting, so we'd end up incorrectly \"compressing\" a value range to the left! The fix is quite simple and consists in taking the maximum value of the new end offset and the previous end offset, I think.</p>\n<p>Upstreaming in case it's of interest to get a tiny dot release (or have this patch ride along other security fixes) for this in<br>\n0.36.0, otherwise I can put it on an internal fork if preferred, as this<br>\nis a real-world issue affecting our users who are trying to use debugging.</p>\n</blockquote>",
