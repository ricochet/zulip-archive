Late 2019! before the pandemic! our eyes were so full of stars and dreams of the future!</p>\n<p>The behavior we really care about for truncation are taken care of by the fd_filestat_set test, which shows fd_filestat_set_size works correctly, and the file_truncation test, which shows that opening with OFLAGS_TRUNC will truncate the file.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
