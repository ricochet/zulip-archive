I don't think that the defense-in-depth argument holds a ton of water here because we make no attempt to reset the stack for non-async calls. If an alternate stack was always used then I think there's a case to be made for having this as an option since it would be turning off a uniformly off-by-default behavior, but otherwise as-is this option is only applicable with async support and the pooling instance allocator, both of which are already niche.</p>\n<p>@cfallin I know in the past you've argued that this behavior should remain, so I'm curious if you still feel that way or if I could perhaps convince you of otherwise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think it's pretty important to keep this behavior, for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Depending on regalloc and stack frame management code to be correct in order to not leak stale data from other instances feels way too risky to me. Yes, any regalloc bug could create a read gadget that reads anything in the address space... but having sensitive data from another instance immediately on our stack, in stack slots that haven't yet been overwritten, increases risk by a very significant amount. It just seems like too much to me to remove that layer of safety (zero out the sensitive data under the nose of the new instance) in cases where we are otherwise very careful about isolation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Because of that, I want the <em>option</em> to run with zeroed stacks for new instances. However, I don't care too much if it's the default or not; there are a number of config options that folks running wasmtime in high-performance, high-security settings will want to consider anyway, and this is just one more such setting. But the option shouldn't go away, IMHO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And actually I agree that the inconsistency between async and sync cases should be addressed, but in the opposite direction: it would be great if someday we could have the option to execute sync Wasm calls on a fresh zeroed stack as well! But almost certainly not by default because that's more of a significant penalty (async needs some separate stack whereas sync can run on the host stack otherwise).<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
