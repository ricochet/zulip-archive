The<br>\n<code>cargo deny</code> builder is slightly different in that it checks a few other<br>\nthings about our dependency tree such as licenses, duplicates, etc. This<br>\ncommit removes the advisory check from <code>cargo deny</code> on CI and then moves<br>\nthe <code>cargo audit</code> check to a separate workflow.</p>\n<p>The <code>cargo audit</code> check will now run nightly and will open an issue on<br>\nthe Wasmtime repository when an advisory is found. This should help make<br>\nit such that our CI is never broken by the publication of an advisory<br>\nbut we're still promptly notified whenever an advisory is made. I've<br>\nupdated the release process notes to indicate that the open issues<br>\nshould be double-checked to ensure that there are no open advisories<br>\nthat we need to take care of.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
