Simplicity also matters when it's the source but the IR is processed by code other than ours; e.g. someone writes an analysis that evaluates security taintedness, or value ranges, or numeric precision, or ..., and needs to understand semantics to some degree. Basically, there is a cost (which may be worth paying in many cases, to be clear!) to adding new opcodes that is mainly paid when we try to move beyond the current \"Wasm -&gt; CLIF -&gt; new backends\" pipeline.</p>\n<p>One thing that I'm hearing, though, and that definitely has value, is the emphasis that there should be <em>some</em> level at which Wasm semantics specifically are 1-to-1-mapped; so when I get the new isel backend-generator online and have the rule-based design working, we will be in a place where we could have Wasm-opcode-specific CLIF opcodes, but in a separate \"stratum\" of sorts that is always broken down by another rule unless there's a specific match in the consumer. Basically what I'm saying is I think that this tension is temporary and I'll work as fast as I can to build the thing that fixes it :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",

In that sense I feel like the design here has (since the time of this opening) settled on \"let's stick with simple ops\" and it's been working out well-enough, so is it perhaps time to close this?</p>\n</blockquote>",

I feel this feature is more about making the CLIF ISA \"nicer,\" which is a bit relative, but not unreasonable. The risk is that it actually complicates things (\"one CLIF instruction per Wasm instruction\" is also \"nice\") or that it slows down lowering.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>This would involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reviewing CLIF SIMD instructions to identify specialized instructions that can be replaced by pattern-matching: e.g., any instruction that involves widening/narrowing, conversion from signed to unsigned or vice versa, pairwise or low/high access, conversion from to from floats, etc.</li>\n<li>replace those instructions in the lowerings with the pattern-matched version</li>\n<li>remove unused instructions</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Leave things as-is: some mixture of the \"specialized CLIF instruction for a Wasm SIMD instruction\" paradigm along with some of the \"pattern-match several simpler CLIF instructions\" paradigm.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
