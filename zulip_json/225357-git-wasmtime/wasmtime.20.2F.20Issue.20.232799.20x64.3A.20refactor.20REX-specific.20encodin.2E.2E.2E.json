I've tried to use it more generally, because making things generally public with <code>pub</code> (no <code>pub(crate)</code>) seems to make unused code invisible to rustc; in theory, external users could still use it, so it's considered live code. (And rustc doesn't seem to try to infer that things marked <code>pub</code> and buried in, but that are not accessible from the outside of the crate, are in fact equivalent to <code>pub(crate)</code>.)</p>\n</blockquote>",
