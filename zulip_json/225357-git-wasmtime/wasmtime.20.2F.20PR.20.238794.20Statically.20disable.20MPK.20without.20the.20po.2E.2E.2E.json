This notably makes <code>ProtectionKey</code> an uninhabited <code>enum</code> meaning that <code>Option&lt;ProtectionKey&gt;</code> in the <code>Store</code> is a zero-sized field and <code>.is_none()</code> returns a constant <code>true</code>. This is on the hot path of entering/exiting wasm so can help speed up things a bit there.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
