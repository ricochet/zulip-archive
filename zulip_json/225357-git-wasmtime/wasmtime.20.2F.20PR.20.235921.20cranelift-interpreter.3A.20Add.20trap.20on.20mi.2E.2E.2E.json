By coincidence the fuzzer found a similar issue in #5922 so we will probably get our answer there!</p>\n</blockquote>",

The reason is that this store is accessing memory out of bounds, and the interpreter didn't catch it!</p>\n<p>Technically the <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-codegen/latest/cranelift_codegen/ir/entities/struct.StackSlot.html\">stack slots can be reordered</a>, so we could reorder this slot to be at the end, and then we would access past the end of the stack. The interpreter never does that so it would never detect that case.</p>\n<p>I've opened #5927 to track this!</p>\n</blockquote>",
