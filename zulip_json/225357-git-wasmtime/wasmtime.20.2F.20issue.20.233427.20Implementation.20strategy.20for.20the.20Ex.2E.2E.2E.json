I don't think that the setjmp/longjmp strategy is set in stone at all and it has a significant downside in that it's got a fair deal of overhead entering into WebAssembly from the host (need to call <code>setjmp</code> and save regs, currently forces calling a foreign function that isn't inlined in optimized builds, etc).</p>\n<p>Personally what I would shoot for is that the exception handling proposal would be zero-cost (or very close to zero) for wasm code which doesn't throw exceptions and then traps would use the same model, ideally making them zero-cost as well to enter from the host.</p>\n<p>I'm not personally familiar with how other engines implement exceptions but I suspect we can draw a lot of inspiration from them. I'd be initiall dubiuos that DWARF/SEH are our best options for implementing the exception handling proposal, but I wouldn't necessarily rule it out at the same time. I think it'd be good to gather information first and weigh pros/cons of various implementation strategies. </p>\n</blockquote>",

My initial naive thought for how we'd represent this is that we'd change all functions that return <code>Result&lt;T, Trap&gt;</code> to return <code>Result&lt;T, anyhow::Error&gt;</code> (like the rest of Wasmtime's APIs) and we'd add a new <code>wasmtime::Exception</code> type to map onto wasm exceptions.

I haven't done much analysis of its own source or why these timings are as slow as they are, but this poses a significant obstacle for embeddings of Wasmtime that want high performance wasm with also loading lots of modules. Backtrace capturing being on the order of milliseconds is also a far cry from the overhead of calling into wasm which is on the order of nanoseconds. These performance numbers were the primary motivator for <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3932\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3932</a>.</p>\n<p>It's also worth pointing out that \"it's ok for traps to be slow\" isn't necessarily a given with WASI's <code>proc_exit(0)</code> being implemented by raising a trap. That means that programs, as part of a normal execution, may raise a trap as they exit the process with a 0 return code. Additionally performance-wise libunwind also performs quite bad at high parallelism since unwinding currently takes a global lock in the Rust <code>backtrace</code> crate.</p>\n<p>All this is basically to say that while libunwind/dwarf/seh/etc may be appealing from a compiler simplicity point of view it may not be as appealing from a performance point of view. I believe there's a lot of implementations of libunwind, though, and we can probably investigate some other ones to see if they have reasonable performance compared to whatever the system glibc is. That may change things but if it's still somewhat the same we may, for performance reasons, be pushed to mirror SpiderMonkey's or another JS JIT's implementation of unwinding despite the increase in complexity.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
