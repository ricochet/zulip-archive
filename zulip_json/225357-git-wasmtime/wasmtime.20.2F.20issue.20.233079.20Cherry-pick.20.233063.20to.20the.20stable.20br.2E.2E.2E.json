We mostly make new releases for releasing new features. Currently we don't have a notion of a \"stable release\" or similar. We hope to signal this soon with a 1.0 release that additionally signals a level of API stability, but in the meantime the quality of the implementation of 0.26 should be the same as 0.28 and beyond.</p>\n</blockquote>",
