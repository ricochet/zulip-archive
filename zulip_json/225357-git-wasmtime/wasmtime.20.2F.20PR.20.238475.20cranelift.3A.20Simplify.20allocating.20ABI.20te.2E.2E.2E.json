One kind was the return-area pointer, which must be allocated before any instructions are lowered so that the return instructions will all use the same VReg that the prologue defines. After this commit, that allocation still happens at the same point, but now it follows the pattern of other ABI glue and uses a VRegAllocator directly.</p>\n<p>The other kind was a truly local kind of temporary used in only one uncommon path in gen_copy_arg_to_regs. That is unnecessary because we already allocate temporaries as-needed in all other paths in that method, so this commit just follows the same pattern.</p>\n<p>This change avoids heap-allocating two temporary Vecs during init, as well as a third Vec that was live for the entire lifetime of the Callee. The latter almost always contained only a bunch of <code>None</code> values, and was only used at the end of lowering.</p>\n</blockquote>",
