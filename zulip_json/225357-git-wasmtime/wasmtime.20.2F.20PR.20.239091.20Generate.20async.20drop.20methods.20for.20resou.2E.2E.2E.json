So I invented a custom naming scheme for the component bindgen config. I went with: <code>\"[drop]{resource-name}\"</code> where <code>{resource-name}</code> is the name as defined in WIT. e.g. <code>\"[drop]input-stream\"</code>.</p>\n<p>This shouldn't conflict with anything existing in the wild as WIT identifiers are not allowed to contain square brackets.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To the reviewer: please double check <code>resource_async</code>. I'm not familiar with this part of the codebase.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Spawned off from <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/9058\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/9058</a>. This change is a prerequisite for a potential solution of that issue, but seems useful enough on its own.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
