I believe you're right that this rule is not necessary since we have that one. I'm not going to delete it right now though while we're still thinking through how best to express rules involving commutative operators. Chris, Nick, Trevor, and I had a long chat on the subject earlier today, but we don't have a complete plan yet.</p>\n</blockquote>",
