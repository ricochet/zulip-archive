From my testing, it seems the new <code>wasmtime_error_new</code> function in the C API doesn't copy the string passed by the <code>const char*</code> argument when being called; instead the supplied char pointer is dereferenced later after <code>wasmtime_error_new</code> has already returned, e.g. when returning the <code>wasmtime_error_t*</code> in the epoch callback. Is this intended?</p>\n<p>I would have expected a similar behavior as <code>wasmtime_trap_new</code>, which copies the string when being called, so that the memory holding the string can be freed by the caller after the function returns. Otherwise, it's not quite clear to me when the memory can be freed.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",

That's a mistake in the API and a subtle detail with the implementation. It's definitely not intended that the pointer should remain live, the contents should be copied into the error. </p>\n<p>The line that needs to change is <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/6bb0ec7a11944e820e646c97f95e7fde517b486d/crates/c-api/src/error.rs#L28\">this one</a>, namely the <code>anyhow!(msg_string)</code> should become <code>anyhow!(\"{msg_string}\")</code>. @theothergraham or @kpreisser would one of y'all be up for a PR along those lines?</p>\n</blockquote>",
