Rather than returning this to the instance allocator when we're done with it, which won't even know what to do with it since the instance allocator didn't create the GC heap, we simply rely on the <code>DisabledGcHeap</code>'s <code>Drop</code> implementation.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
