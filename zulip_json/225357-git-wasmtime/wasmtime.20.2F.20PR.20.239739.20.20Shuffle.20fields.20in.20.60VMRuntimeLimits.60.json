This structure's layout is<br>\nnontrivial to calculate on 32-bit platforms as it needs to take the<br>\nalignment of 64-bit integers into account which differs between ARM and<br>\nx86 for example. To make this easier shuffle all the 64-bit integers are now<br>\nfirst, which means we don't have to worry about alignment.</p>\n<p>I'll note that this particular ordering is still a bit brittle because<br>\nwe might need to shuffle things again if more fields are added. That<br>\nbeing said any misalignment is caught during testing of the <code>wasmtime</code><br>\ncrate so there's not much danger in adding more things, it'll just<br>\nrequire updating a few more locations.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The first commit is the actual change and the second commit is purely test expectation updates. This is because the offset of the stack-limit field has changed, and functions all have an explicit check of the stack limit.</p>\n</blockquote>",
