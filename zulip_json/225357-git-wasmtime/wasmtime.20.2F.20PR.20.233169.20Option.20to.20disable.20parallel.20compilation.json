Currently, it is only possible to do this via toggling the <code>parallel-compilation</code> feature.</p>\n<p>In our projects we use wasmtime extensively. Specifically, it is used for powering several execution environments. Most of times, parallel compilation is beneficial. However, there is a weird one that kind of requires single-threaded compilation. This is because we want consistent memory consumption and less variance for compilation time.</p>\n<p>What we could do is to basically settle on turning off the feature for our project. But that would be a shame.</p>\n<p>This didn't go through a discussion just because I thought it would be really easy to implement and I only noticed that the discussion is required after I created the PR. I hope this is not a big issue.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
