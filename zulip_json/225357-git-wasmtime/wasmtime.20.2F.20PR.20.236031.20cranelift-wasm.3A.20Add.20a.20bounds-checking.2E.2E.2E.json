Therefore, the partial <code>index &gt; bound</code> check is sufficient for this heap configuration.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this has the advantage that a series of Wasm loads that use the same dynamic index operand but different static offset immediates -- which is a common code pattern when accessing multiple fields in the same struct that is in linear memory -- will all emit the same <code>index &gt; bound</code> check, which we can GVN.</p>\n<p>Partially.</p>\n<p>The bounds check comparison is GVN'd but we still branch on values we should know will always be true if we get this far in the code. This is actual <code>br_if</code>s in the non-Spectre code and <code>select_spectre_guard</code>s that we should know will always go a certain way if we have Spectre mitigations enabled. See the second commit for examples.</p>\n<p>Improving the non-Spectre case is pretty straightforward: walk the dominator tree and remember which values we've already branched on at this point, and therefore we can simplify any further conditional branches on those same values into direct jumps.</p>\n<p>Improving the Spectre case requires something that is morally the same, but has a couple snags:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We don't have actual <code>br_if</code>s to determine whether the bounds checking condition succeeded or not. We need to instead reason about dominating <code>select_spectre_guard; {load, store}</code> instruction pairs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have to be SUPER careful about reasoning \"through\" <code>select_spectre_guard</code>s.  Our general rule is never to do that, since it could break the speculative execution sandboxing that the instruction is designed for.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This pull request leaves implementing these new optimization passes for follow ups.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Without spectre guards the previously-trapping condition prevents overflow, but with spectre guards this could overflow. I think the saving grace, though, is that the overflowed value isn't used due to the spectre guard.</p>\n</blockquote>",
