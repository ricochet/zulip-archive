Namely the uffd logic for creating<br>\npaged memory as well as the memfd logic for creating a memory image now<br>\nshare an implementation to avoid duplicating bounds-checks or other<br>\nvalidation conditions. The main purpose of this commit is to fix a<br>\nfuzz-bug where a multiplication overflowed. The overflow itself was<br>\nbenign but it seemed better to fix the overflow in only one place<br>\ninstead of multiple.</p>\n<p>The overflow in question is specifically when an initializer is checked<br>\nto be statically out-of-bounds and multiplies a memory's minimum size by<br>\nthe wasm page size, returning the result as a <code>u64</code>. For<br>\nmemory64-memories of size <code>1 &lt;&lt; 48</code> this multiplication will overflow.<br>\nThis was actually a preexisting bug with the <code>try_paged_init</code> function<br>\nwhich was copied for memfd, but cropped up here since memfd is used more<br>\noften than paged initialization. The fix here is to skip validation of<br>\nthe <code>end</code> index if the size of memory is <code>1 &lt;&lt; 64</code> since if the <code>end</code><br>\nindex can be represented as a <code>u64</code> then it's in-bounds. This is<br>\nsomewhat of an esoteric case, though, since a memory of minimum size <code>1\n&lt;&lt; 64</code> can't ever exist (we can't even ask the os for that much memory,<br>\nand even if we could it would fail).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

Maybe worth benchmarking the memfd creation (by continually loading and throwing away a <code>Module</code> and either instantiating once, or forcing memfd creation eagerly) for some module with a big heap?</p>\n<p>And also, this approach <em>is</em> much cleaner and easier to maintain, and IIRC the zero-filled holes in the memfd will be filled in by fresh zero-pages the first time someone CoWs each one, so perhaps it's reasonable to just frontload that work once we commit to having a memfd image.
