In that sense I don't think there's a clear answer whether we should make a point release for this or not.</p>\n<p>I'm not certain this is the best place to discuss policy, but at least for me personally I do not think that this warrants a patch release. We intentionally chose a pretty rapid release schedule to avoid crunches around releases like this. I would not have personally wanted to make a patch release for <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3906\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3906</a> either, but I wasn't the one driving the process and I'm not going to stop someone else.</p>\n<p>That's all to say that if the decision comes down to me personally my stance is that we shouldn't do this unless there's a clear policy saying we should do this. If someone else wants to take this up and manage it though I won't stop them.</p>\n</blockquote>",
