(NetBSD/x86-64 does have rustup binaries, but e.g. aarch64 does not, so same issue there.)</p>\n<p>IMHO at least, the most useful effort at this point would be to get Rust to provide binaries for OpenBSD and NetBSD on more architectures (x86-64, aarch64, riscv64 for OpenBSD; the latter two for NetBSD and I think FreeBSD too). Then verify compatibility (and add CI jobs to keep things compiling?) in the system crates we use -- the cap-std series, etc. Finally whatever few lines of code are needed in the <code>traphandlers</code> module are fine, as Alex notes, under tier 3; we can even add check-jobs to keep things compiling, with the understanding we could disable it at any point if it gets in the way too much.</p>\n</blockquote>",
