We intentionally only have a singular TLS variable in<br>\nthe whole world, and the problem is that when stack-switching off an<br>\nasync thread we were not restoring the previous TLS state. This is<br>\nnecessary in two cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Futures aren't guaranteed to be polled/completed in a stack-like<br>\n  fashion. If a poll sees that a future isn't ready then we may resume<br>\n  execution in a previous wasm context that ends up needing the TLS<br>\n  information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Futures can also cross threads (when the whole store crosses threads)<br>\n  and we need to save/restore TLS state from the thread we're coming<br>\n  from and the thread that we're going to.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The stack switching issue necessitates some more glue around suspension<br>\nand resumption of a stack to ensure we save/restore the TLS state on<br>\nboth sides. The thread issue, however, also necessitates that we use<br>\n<code>#[inline(never)]</code> on TLS access functions and never have TLS borrows<br>\nlive across a function which could result in running arbitrary code (as<br>\nwas the case for the <code>tls::set</code> function.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
