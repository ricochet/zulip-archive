A final type may not be a supertype of another type. A concrete heap type matches another concrete heap type if its concrete type is a subtype (potentially transitively) of the other heap type's concrete type.</p>\n<p>Next, I'll begin support for allocating GC structs and arrays at runtime.</p>\n<p>I've also implemented <code>O(1)</code> subtype checking in the types registry:</p>\n<p>In a type system with single inheritance, the subtyping relationships between all types form a set of trees. The root of each tree is a type that has no supertype; each node's immediate children are the types that directly subtype that node.</p>\n<p>For example, consider these types:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>class Base {}\nclass A subtypes Base {}\nclass B subtypes Base {}\nclass C subtypes A {}\nclass D subtypes A {}\nclass E subtypes C {}\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>These types produce the following tree:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>           Base\n          /    \\\n         A      B\n        / \\\n       C   D\n      /\n     E\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Note the following properties:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If <code>sub</code> is a subtype of <code>sup</code> (either directly or transitively) then <code>sup</code> <em>must</em> be on the path from <code>sub</code> up to the root of <code>sub</code>'s tree.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additionally, <code>sup</code> <em>must</em> be the <code>i</code>th node down from the root in that path, where <code>i</code> is the length of the path from <code>sup</code> to its tree's root.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therefore, if we maintain a vector containing the path to the root for each type, then we can simply check if <code>sup</code> is at index <code>supertypes(sup).len()</code> within <code>supertypes(sub)</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I think there are some more tricks we can play with <code>InstancePre</code>s to make cross-module-subtyping fast for all types that exist at <code>InstancePre</code> creation time, but for new subtypes created during runtime we will always need to fall back to locking (or equivalent) AFAICT.</p>\n</blockquote>",
