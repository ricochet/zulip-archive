Pulley's previous <code>Call</code> instruction was similar to native call instructions where arguments/results are implicitly in the right location according to the ABI, but movement between registers is more expensive with Pulley than with native architectures. The <code>CallN</code> instructions here enable listing a few arguments (only integer registers) in the opcode itself. This removes the need for individual <code>xmov</code> instructions into individual registers and instead it can all be done within the opcode handlers.</p>\n<p>This additionally enables passing the same argument twice to a function to reside only in one register. Finally parallel-copies between these registers are supported as the interpreter loads all registers and then stores all registers.</p>\n<p>These new instructions participate in register allocation differently from before where the first few arguments are allowed to be in any register and no longer use <code>reg_fixed_use</code>. All other arguments (and all float arguments for example) continue to use <code>reg_fixed_use</code>.</p>\n<p>Locally sightglass reports this change speeding up <code>pulldown-cmark</code> by 2-10%. On a <code>fib(N)</code> micro-benchmark it didn't help as much as I was hoping that it was going to.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
