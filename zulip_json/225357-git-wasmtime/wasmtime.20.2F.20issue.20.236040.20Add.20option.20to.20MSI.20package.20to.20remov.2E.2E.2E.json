I'm sorry to whinge.</p>\n<p>I just installed wasmtime 6.0.1, and noticed in the Control Panel that 6.0.0 was still on my machine. I know that some people like to have multiple versions of wasmtime on their machine for regression testing or other reasons, but I'd like to see an option in MSI to remove previous versions.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>This feature would reduce clutter on one's drive.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>All this would entail is adding the option when packaging the app in MSI Package Builder.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>The alternative is to keep doing what I do, i.e., manually remove the older package via Control Panel. It's an unnecessary hassle.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I suspect this wasn't a deliberate decision; many of us working on Wasmtime just aren't that familiar with Windows.</p>\n<p>I think the place to fix this would be in either <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/ci/build-tarballs.sh\">ci/build-tarballs.sh</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/ci/wasmtime.wxs\">ci/wasmtime.wxs</a>, right? Do you think you could put together a pull request to fix this?</p>\n<p>Also, maybe @peterhuene can weigh in on this.</p>\n</blockquote>",
