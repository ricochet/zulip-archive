Previously the virtual stack pointer was updated but the rest of the backend assumed the real stack pointer was updated. This updates the pulley backend to match the other backends in this respects and fixes a test on my \"more complete pulley integration\" branch.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Virtual-SP was a mechanism we used to handle frame layout relative to sp while sp moved during a callsite sequence; it went away in #8631, so probably it's a vestigial artifact here from Pulley's early development history (?). In any case, LGTM.</p>\n</blockquote>",
