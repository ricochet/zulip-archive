Back in 2020 I built the aarch64 backend to a similar level in about that time as well. For the level of completeness that we hope for with a good backend, SIMD, reasonable optimizations, reasonable confidence in correctness, etc., I'd expect around six compiler-engineer-months of fulltime work and the backend would likely be around ~30kLoC.</p>\n<p>I'll note our <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/docs/stability-tiers.md\">tiers</a> as well: a new backend would arrive at tier 3, which allows for some amount of \"work-in-progress\" or incompleteness in-tree but does expect ongoing involvement and responsiveness to issues. (E.g., tail-call support recently had architecture-specific work for each backend and some of our maintainers pitched in.) Partly this is inspired by our experience with a partial arm32 backend, which we had to delete because no one was around to maintain or finish it. In other words, we want to make sure that the ongoing maintenance is properly factored in.</p>\n<p>All that is not to discourage anything -- we would absolutely love to have this! -- just to ensure that the proper level of serious commitment is there, as it's not a small undertaking.</p>\n</blockquote>",

(The instruction emission code doesn't need to know the whole ISA, just the subset you use)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's probably easier than starting from a full copy of a production backend and trying to make a pass over it, or similar. We're happy to answer questions on Zulip as you have them!</p>\n</blockquote>",
