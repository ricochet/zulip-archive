This seemingly<br>\nvery basic issue was not caught because the other major user of reftype<br>\nsupport, SpiderMonkey, extracts stackmaps with a lower-level API. The<br>\nSM integration was built this way to avoid an awkward API quirk when<br>\npassing stackmaps through a <code>CodeSink</code> that proxies them to a<br>\n<code>StackMapSink</code>: the <code>CodeSink</code> wants <code>Value</code>s for each reference slot,<br>\nwhile the actual <code>StackMapSink</code> does not require these. This PR tweaks<br>\nthe plumbing in a slightly different way to make <code>wasmtime</code> GC tests,<br>\nand presumably other consumers of stack-map info from the top-level<br>\nCranelift interface, happy.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
