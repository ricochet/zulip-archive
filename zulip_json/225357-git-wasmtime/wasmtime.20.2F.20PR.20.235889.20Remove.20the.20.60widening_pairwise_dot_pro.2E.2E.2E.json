This commit removes the instruction and instead represents it with the existing <code>iadd_pairwise</code> instruction (among others) and updates backends to with new pattern matches to have the same codegen as before.</p>\n<p>This interestingly entirely removed the codegen rule with no replacement on the AArch64 backend as the existing rules all existed to produce the same codegen.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
