Since the move to a version of RA2 that requires SSA input, this is a no-op, and only complicates the input program. Additionally, in RA2-0.7.0 support for program moves have been removed, which means that any move present in the input program will always be present after RA2 has run.<br>\n&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
