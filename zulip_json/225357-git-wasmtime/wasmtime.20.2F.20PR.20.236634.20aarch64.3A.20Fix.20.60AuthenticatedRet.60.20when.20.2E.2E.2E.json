In this situation an authenticated return instruction was used, such as <code>retab</code>, and no extra stack bytes were popped. The fix here is to use the non-<code>retab</code> path which handles stack bytes being popped if there are stack bytes to pop.</p>\n<p>Closes #6567</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
