This accessor was used to handle <code>round*</code>, <code>pextr*</code>, and <code>pshufb</code> instructions. The <code>round*</code> ones had already moved to the appropriate <code>XmmUnary*</code> variant and <code>pshufb</code> was additionally moved over to that variant as well.</p>\n<p>The <code>pextr*</code> instructions got a new <code>Inst</code> variant and additionally had their constructors slightly modified to no longer require the type as input. The encoding for these instructions now automatically handles the various type-related operands through a new <code>SseOpcode::Pextrq</code> operand to represent 64-bit movements.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
