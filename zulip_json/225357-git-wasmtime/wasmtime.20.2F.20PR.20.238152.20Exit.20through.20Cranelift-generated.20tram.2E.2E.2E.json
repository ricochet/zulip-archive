These functions are required to exit through some manner of trampoline to handle runtime requirements for backtracing right now. Currently this is done via inline assembly for each architecture (or external assembly for s390x). This is a bit unfortunate as it's a lot of hand-coding and making sure everything is right, and it's not easy to update as it's multiple platforms to update.</p>\n<p>The change in this commit is to instead use Cranelift-generated trampolines for this purpose instead. The path for invoking a builtin function now looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wasm code calls a statically known symbol for each builtin.</li>\n<li>The statically known symbol will perform exit trampoline duties (e.g. pc/fp/etc) and then load a function pointer to the host implementation.</li>\n<li>The host implementation is invoked and then proceeds as usual.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main new piece for this PR is that all wasm modules and functions are compiled in parallel but an output of this compilation phase is what builtin functions are required. All builtin functions are then unioned together into one set and then anything required is generated just afterwards. That means that only one builtin-trampoline per-module is generated per-builtin.</p>\n<p>This work is inspired by #8135 and my own personal desire to have as much about our ABI details flowing through Cranelift as we can. This in theory makes it more flexible to deal with future improvements to our ABI.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
