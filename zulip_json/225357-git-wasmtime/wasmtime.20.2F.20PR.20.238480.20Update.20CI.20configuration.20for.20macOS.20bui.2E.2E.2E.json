Additionally drop <code>macos-14</code> from the C API tests since testing <code>macos-latest</code> should be sufficient enough.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
