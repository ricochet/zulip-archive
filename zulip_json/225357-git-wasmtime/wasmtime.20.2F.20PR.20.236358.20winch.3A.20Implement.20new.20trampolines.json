For example I saw this and immediately thought \"wait that's bad because this is a defined index\" and then looked around a bit before I noticed above that the variable was shadowed with the <code>FuncIndex</code>. This <code>index.as_u32()</code> is fine as-is, but it might be useful to use the <code>wasmtime-types::*</code> index types throughout winch in the future (only if you agree of course!)</p>\n</blockquote>",
