That achieves around 1.8-2.8 evaluations per block on average, for large functions.  From those experiments I saw that the by far the most important factor was to initialise the worklist in reverse postorder, and operate it as a queue thereafter.</p>\n<p>This one does something simpler, which is to repeatedly visit the blocks in reverse postorder, until there are no changes.  Many inputs require 3 passes (3.0 evaluations per block), and the worst I saw, for <code>joey_big.clif</code>, required 4 passes.  For the following reasons, I concluded that using a worklist wasn't worth the extra complexity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>given the above numbers, using a worklist wouldn't give a big reduction in the average evals per block</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the worklist itself adds some overhead, and so does having an auxiliary mapping of block to bool, so as to be able to efficiently avoid inserting the same item in the worklist if it is already there</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>more than half the expense lies in Phase 1 (building the summaries) and in particular Phase 3 (editing the result); in particular removing formal parameters is expensive because CL's cost for removing just one formal parameter is linear in the number of formals, and that adds up when blocks have 300+ formals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for a nonoptimising CLIF-&gt;aarch64 translation, this pass costs circa 0.6% in instruction counts, and will be correspondingly less in the opt_level=speed case.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One simple thing I could do is to filter out summaries for blocks that have neither formal parameters nor actual parameters in their jumps, before iterating.  From what I've seen there are many such blocks and they can't possibly contribute anything to the overall result.</p>\n</blockquote>",

For a couple of large tests, it roughly halved the number of summaries (meaning, from around 1/2 the number of blocks to around 1/4 the number of blocks) but reduced the overall insn count for the pass only by around 3%.  And the fixpointing is done over the summaries.  So the fixpointing cost must be pretty minimal already.</p>\n<p>I'll leave this refinement in the respin patch.</p>\n</blockquote>",
