This ensures that we're never writing to offsets below SP, which would be a bug if we were to receive a signal before the SP update in the prologue, or after the SP update in the epilogue.<br>\n&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
