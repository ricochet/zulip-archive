This commit takes them from the mid-end CLIF into the backend vcode, and then from that vcode into the finalized mach buffer during emission.</p>\n<p>During lowering, we compile the <code>UserStackMapEntry</code>s into packed <code>UserStackMap</code>s. This is the appropriate moment in time to do that coalescing, packing, and compiling because the stack map entries are immutable from this point on.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we include user stack maps in the <code>Debug</code> and disassembly implementations for vcode, just after their associated safepoint instructions. This allows us to see the stack maps we are generating when debugging, as well as write filetests that check we are generating the expected stack maps for the correct instructions.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
