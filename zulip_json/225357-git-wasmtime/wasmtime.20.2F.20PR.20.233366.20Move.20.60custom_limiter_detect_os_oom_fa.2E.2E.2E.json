Previously this used <code>libc::fork</code> but the call afterwards to<br>\n<code>libc::wait</code> was racing all other child subprocesses since it would wait<br>\nfor any child instead of the specific child we were interested in. There<br>\nwas also difficulty getting the output of the child on failure coming<br>\nto the parent, so this commit simplifies the situation by moving the<br>\ntest to its own executable where it's the only test.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
