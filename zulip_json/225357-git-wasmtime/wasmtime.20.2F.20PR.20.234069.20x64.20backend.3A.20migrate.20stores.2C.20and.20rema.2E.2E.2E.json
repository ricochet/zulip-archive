That way, anyone looking at the lowering can quickly discern what instructions will be emitted in a lowering without having to trace some enum variants through to <code>emit.rs</code> (if they even know to look there!). It's not clear what instructions <code>x64_movrm</code> and <code>x64_xmm_movrm</code> would correspond to (especially in the <code>x64_xmm_movrm</code> case which takes an opcode!) so they probably shouldn't have the <code>x64_</code> prefix.</p>\n</blockquote>",
