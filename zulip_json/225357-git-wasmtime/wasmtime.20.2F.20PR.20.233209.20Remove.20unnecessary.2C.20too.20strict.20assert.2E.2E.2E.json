Yes, the lowering and assertion was there because the lowering was for a very specific instruction F64x2ConvertLowI32x4U, that expects input of I32. The input can't be I16X8. So I see, I think the change is needed at the instruction definition? Or better yet, just put this code in a path that targets I32 input and marks anything else as unimplemented? What does the fuzzer use to generate it's valid input?</p>\n</blockquote>",

(In other words, the failure mode should always be \"fails to validate\" rather than \"assertion triggered\".) If we have a lowering that only supports particular types, then we can add those constraints to the instruction, yes -- that would bring things into <code>correspondence</code>.</p>\n<p>This is a bit of a wider net than Wasm-based fuzzing -- I definitely recognize that we've left several corners unfilled in several lowerings because \"the Wasm translator would never do that\". I guess that's sort of the point now -- we're fuzzing at the CLIF level to find these corners and ensure completeness :-)</p>\n<p>And, since we're talking about the <code>fcvt_from_uint</code> instruction generally, it seems to me that we don't really want to limit it; e.g. the aarch64 implementation <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/ddfadaeb384c11d2928fcf89dd1bd4e40692367b/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/aarch64/lower_inst.rs#L3125-L3139\">here</a> supports all vector types.</p>\n<p>So my question is: how much work is it to actually build the other cases out?

Yes, unfortunately there is no simple lowering to convert I8 or even I16 .. even with AVX-512. It will take finding some accepted sequence. I can look deeper into this, but in general doing thing with packed in particular bytes is never so straight forward. So ... that is a problem then, right? If we constrain the CLIF to only allow I32 because X64 is just handling the lowering it expects for F64x2ConvertLowI32x4U, while the aarch64 implementation these other type cases those other cases would never get tested by the fuzzer. This is the type of thing that I need to document. Any thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>",

I do think that filling this out to support the other type cases is the right thing to do; the alternative is to restrict the instruction's acceptable types, but then that is a weird incongruity in the CLIF instruction set (most other SIMD instructions are fully polymorphic over vector types). And the general direction of \"restrict CLIF to only exactly what Wasm needs\" feels wrong too, because it's already (much) more general: e.g. it supports 8/16 bit types and booleans, which aren't used in Wasm at all. If this becomes a huge burden, of course, then we can always reconsider how broadly we define the CLIF ops.</p>\n</blockquote>",
