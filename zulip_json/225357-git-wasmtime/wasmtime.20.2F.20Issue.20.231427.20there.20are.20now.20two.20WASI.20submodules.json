The problem is that <code>cargo publish</code> doesn't include <code>wig/WASI</code> in the <code>wasi-common</code> package, causing it to break when built out of tree. An <code>include = </code> directive in Cargo.toml didn't fix it. Adding a <code>WASI</code> symlink fixed it for Mac and Linux but didn't work on Windows. </p>\n<p>Since both <code>wasi-common</code> and <code>wig</code> need a <code>WASI</code> directory, for now, the simplest way to fix it was to give them each their own.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Well, <code>wig</code> is hopefully on its last legs, I expect we'll be able to get rid of it within a month or so. In the meantime, we point to the <code>witx</code> path underneath <code>wig</code>. If the one under <code>wasi-common</code> is expected to eventually be the only remaining, should we point there instead?</p>\n<p>And, can we add some sort of CI check that both submodules have the same rev checked out, so that they dont accidentally get out-of-sync?</p>\n<p>I'll take both of these tasks.</p>\n</blockquote>",
