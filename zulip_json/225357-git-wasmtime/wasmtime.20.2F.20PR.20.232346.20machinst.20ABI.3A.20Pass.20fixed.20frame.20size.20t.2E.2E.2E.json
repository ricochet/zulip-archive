For consistency, we need to do the same for gen_clobber_restore.</p>\n<p>Likewise, I followed the same coding convention with the \"mut fixed_frame_storage_size\" as is currently in place in gen_prologue.  Given that any future changes to the computation of the size will need to be kept in sync between gen_prologue and gen_epilogue, it seems preferable to me to also have the code itself as similar as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>",
