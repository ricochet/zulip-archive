We suspect that the bug is in handling of struct-ret args, which is a tier-3 feature, and shouldn't hold back work otherwise. I absolutely want to find the bug, but I also want to minimize secondary breakage and complexity from large reverts.</p>\n</blockquote>",

There don't seem to be any conflicts with any PR merged after that (apart from #4945). If I keep the update to regalloc2 0.4.1 from 0.3.2, I only need to remove two asserts that check that the stack slot class matches the expectation as the respective field has been removed. This means that the revert is almost trivial in amount of work. I do agree that it is a rather large revert and thus risky.</p>\n</blockquote>",
