The criteria we came up with<br>\nwere:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cranelift will get a patch release for any miscompilation, whether or<br>\n  not it affects Wasmtime.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wasmtime will get a patch release for security issues and bugs which<br>\n  seriously hinder usability.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The consensus at the time was that due to Wasmtime's monthly release<br>\nschedule we want to be pretty strict about what generates a patch<br>\nrelease, hence the threshold being at serious bugs as opposed to any<br>\nbugs found.</p>\n<p>This commit attempts to update the <code>stability-release.md</code> document with<br>\nour documented release process. The release cadence section is brought<br>\nup to date, the Wasmtime section was edited slightly (it largely already<br>\nsaid this which I only just realized), and a Cranelift section was<br>\nadded.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
