In some cases, it can be useful to have this hook do asynchronous operations; to acquire a lock, for example.</p>\n<p>This patch series provides an alternate way for users to provide a call hook that mirrors the resource limiter callbacks. To get around some trickiness with Rust types, closures, and Futures, <code>call_hook_async</code> takes an object on which a simple trait is implemented. This hook is then executed using the existing <code>block_on</code> mechanism.</p>\n<p>Beyond just adding this capability, this patch makes two other changes to the code base to avoid an error condition in which one of these tasks becomes scheduled right as an async fiber is being dropped. The first changes the <code>async_cx</code> method so that it returns <code>Option&lt;AsyncCx&gt;</code> instead of just <code>AsyncCx</code>; this can be an early detection mechanism for the fiber being dropped. The more key one is a late check in <code>block_on</code>, which turns a former-panic into being a catchable an error condition.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to @alexcrichton, who figured out the \"resuming a task on a dying thread\" issue.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I haven't ever done benchmarking myself about the costs with call hooks enabled, but I suspect that even as-is it's already at least an order of magnitude slower than \"raw\" syscalls. That being said though even when wiggle is layered on top I suspect it's even slower as we haven't done much work to optimize wiggle bits (I know there's a <code>Mutex</code> somewhere right now frobbed on all entrances and exits, but the mutex is always un-contended). In that sense it might be good to benchmark this locally in something like Viceroy perhaps and see if the overhead is meaningful?</p>\n</blockquote>",
