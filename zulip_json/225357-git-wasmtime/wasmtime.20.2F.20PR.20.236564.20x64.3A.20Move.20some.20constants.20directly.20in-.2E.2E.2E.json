This commit moves some existing constants in <code>x64/lower/isle.rs</code> into <code>lower.isle</code> directly to more easily understand them when reading over instruction lowerings by avoiding having to context switch between ISLE and Rust to understand the value of a constant.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
