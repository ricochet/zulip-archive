The <code>maybe_exit_on_error</code> helper only searched for the former though, so update it to search for the latter as well to handle exits in the component CLI.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
