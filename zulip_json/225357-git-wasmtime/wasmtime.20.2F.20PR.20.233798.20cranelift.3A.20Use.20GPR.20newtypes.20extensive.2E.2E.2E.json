This callsite gets simpler but others maybe gain a <code>.to_reg()</code>, so it's not necessarily any less verbose, but it is a bit more typesafe.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think it would make sense to have one more PR (maybe I'll get to it while waiting on reviews for my components PRs) where we push the newtypes to all the <code>Inst::add</code>/etc methods and I think pushing that to <code>regs::rax</code>/etc in that same PR would make sense.</p>\n<p>But I kinda don't want to do all that right now.</p>\n<p>Does that sound good?</p>\n</blockquote>",
