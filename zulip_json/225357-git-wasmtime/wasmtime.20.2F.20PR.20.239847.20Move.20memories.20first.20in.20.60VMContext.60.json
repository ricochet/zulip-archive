This is done to ensure that the offset to memory-related fields is one of the smaller offsets and ideally fits within an 8-byte offset which helps fit into some special cases on various ISAs. For example x64 has a smaller instruction encoding for 8-bit offsets than 32-bit offsets, and I'm planning on doing a similar optimization for Pulley.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
