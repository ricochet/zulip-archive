That said, I'll consider if there's a way to work this into the types somehow -- perhaps <code>input_to_reg_mem()</code> either takes an operand size and asserts it's as expected, or returns a mem op only if the load would be the right size, or something like that... I don't want to block this PR landing on it but will think further!</p>\n</blockquote>",
