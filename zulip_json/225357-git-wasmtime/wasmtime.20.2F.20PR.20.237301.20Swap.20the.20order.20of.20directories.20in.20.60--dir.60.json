This matches Docker for example and is a little more consistent with only <code>--dir path</code> where the first argument is always treated as a host directory.</p>\n<p>In terms of breaking-ness the movement from <code>--mapdir</code> to <code>--dir</code> hasn't been released with Wasmtime 14 yet so my hope is that this can land on both <code>main</code> and Wasmtime 14.0.0 before it's released to avoid any breakage other than existing scripts migrating from <code>--mapdir</code> to <code>--dir</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
