The proper reference for individual instructions (other than the Arm Architecture Reference Manual or Arm ARM, as people tend to call it) can be found on <a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/\">Arm's developer Web site</a> - just click the \"Architectures\" drop-down menu, then \"CPU Architecture\", followed by the drop-down menu \"A-Profile\" in the middle of the page, and finally, probably the most counter-intuitive step, \"Exploration tools\" (or just use <a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/a-profile/exploration-tools\">this direct link</a>). This page links both to HTML and to XML renditions of the instruction descriptions (ad the system register descriptions like the <code>FPCR</code> that is relevant here), each of which contains the pseudo-code that specifies how instructions behave, including the conditions that cause exceptions. So, browsing through the documentation I think that you are right - since the inputs are 32-bit numbers, there is no danger of getting exceptions. However, there is another subtlety - an architecture implementation (that is, a processor core) is not required to support any of the relevant exceptions; indeed, that is the case for a couple of Arm cores like Cortex-A76. That's why I think that operating systems usually keep them disabled (which is confirmed by a quick check on the machine I have access to); in the worst case, the Wasm runtime can ensure it.</p>\n<p>BTW the <code>SCVTF</code> instruction has several variants and you have been looking at the wrong one - \"(vector, fixed-point)\" instead of \"(vector, integer)\".</p>\n</blockquote>",
