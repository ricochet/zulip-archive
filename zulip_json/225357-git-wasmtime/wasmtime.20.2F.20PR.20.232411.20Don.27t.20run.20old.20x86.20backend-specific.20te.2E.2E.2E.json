It thus doesn't make sense to try to run these tests<br>\nwith the new backend. (The new backend's unwind code should have<br>\nanalogous tests written/ported over eventually.)</p>\n<p>It seems that we were actually building <em>both</em> x86 backends when the<br>\n<code>x64</code> feature was enabled, except that the old x86 backend would never<br>\nbe instantiated by the usual ISA-lookup logic because a <code>x86-64</code> target<br>\ntriple unconditionally resolves to the new one.</p>\n<p>This PR resolves both of the issues by tweaking the feature-config<br>\ndirectives to exclude the <code>x86</code> backend when <code>x64</code> is enabled.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
