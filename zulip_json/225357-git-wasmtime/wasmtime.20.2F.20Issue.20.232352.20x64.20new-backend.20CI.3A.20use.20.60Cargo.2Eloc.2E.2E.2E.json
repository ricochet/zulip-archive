I've seen this issue crop up a few times (the one on #2345), and I suspect it may be a bug in Cargo, so if it shows up even with this added let me know and I can try to dig in more.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Perhaps we could instead create a root-level feature to enable the new x64 backend and get this working without the Cargo feature -- or do you suspect the bug would still be hit?</p>\n</blockquote>",
