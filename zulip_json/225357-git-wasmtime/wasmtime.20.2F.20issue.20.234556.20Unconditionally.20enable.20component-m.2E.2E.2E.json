This is nothing new since we already disable all pooling allocator tests within QEMU since the TB-sized reservation consumes too much memory on the host.</p>\n<p>My current guess is that the component model tests create lots of instances which creates lots of 4G reservations for linear memories (which I guess aren't reused? unsure) so I've tried disabling \"static\" memory and instead forcing dynamic memory for all component model tests when run under qemu. Will see how CI responds...</p>\n</blockquote>",
