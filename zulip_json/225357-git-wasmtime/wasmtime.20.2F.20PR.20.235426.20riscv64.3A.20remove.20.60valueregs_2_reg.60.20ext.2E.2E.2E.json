In this case the side-effect was mostly benign (in theory it could have caused additional values to be computed needlessly), but in general we should be careful to keep side-effects out of the left-hand side to enable further optimizations and work on islec.</p>\n<p>The implicit conversion from <code>Value</code> to <code>Reg</code> turns out to be enough to make the rules in question work, so we can simply remove the use of the extractor in this case.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
