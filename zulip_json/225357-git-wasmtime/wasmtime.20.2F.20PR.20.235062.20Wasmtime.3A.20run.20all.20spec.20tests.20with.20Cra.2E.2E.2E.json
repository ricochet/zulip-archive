We will certainly fuzz differentially, but it is also useful to run our basic testsuite against the new compiler mid-end as part of normal CI. There is already precedent for running the spec tests with a variant of settings (the <code>_pooling</code> versions of each test). The actual spec testsuite execution does not contribute appreciably to CI time compared to the time to compile Wasmtime itself, so running an extra variant of the tests should not increase test cost significantly.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
