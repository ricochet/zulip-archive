Userlands are used to this restriction.</p>\n<p>Thankfully this nonsense goes away, thanks to the component model, in preview 2, where path_readlink just gives a string. Only the (host) component interfacing with a posix <code>readlink(2)</code> needs to do the truncation detection dance.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
