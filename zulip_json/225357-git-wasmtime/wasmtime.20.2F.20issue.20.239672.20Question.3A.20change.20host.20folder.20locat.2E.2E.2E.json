Unfortunately controlling the mounts on the host machine is not possible for me (these are user machines and the host directory change represents the users giving the plugin access to a different folder on their machine). Creating my own fs implementation is a possibility, but obviously one I'd like to avoid if possible (even if it's just a proxy)... do you think the above solution is not in my best interests? I only tested it with <code>read_dir</code> so far and the listing changes as it should. Should I expect more trouble if I go down this route?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Only adding or removing preopens would need wasi-libc to be aware that the set of preopens changed. If the preopen <code>/host</code> has fd 5, then the replace would only change the target of fd 5 such that calling fd_open will open files in the new target of <code>/host</code> and fd_readdir will list files in the new target of <code>/host</code>. As far as wasi-libc is concerned, it would be indistinguishable from all files in <code>/host</code> getting deleted and a set of new files being created in <code>/host</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
