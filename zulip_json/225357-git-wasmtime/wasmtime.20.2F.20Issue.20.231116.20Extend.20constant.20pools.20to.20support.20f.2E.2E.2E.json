It looks like right now we load literal values into integer registers and then move to XMM registers to load 32/64-bit floats, but we could pretty easily change that (using the <code>XmmLoadConst</code> VCode instruction) if we wanted to.</p>\n<p>I think we can leave this open to track an evaluation of whether this makes sense to do, though I suspect it's not too important for most code's performance; the exception would be if we have a lot of duplicated constants and dedup'ing gives a meaningful reduction in code size / icache misses.</p>\n</blockquote>",
