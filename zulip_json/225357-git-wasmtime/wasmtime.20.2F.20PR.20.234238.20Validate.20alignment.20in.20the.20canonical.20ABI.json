Previously alignment was ignored<br>\nbecause I wasn't sure how this would all work out.</p>\n<p>To be extra safe I haven't actually modified any loads/stores and<br>\nthey're all still unaligned. If this becomes a performance issue we can<br>\ninvestigate aligned loads and stores but otherwise I believe the<br>\nrequisite locations have been guarded with traps and I've also added<br>\ndebug asserts to catch possible future mistakes.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
