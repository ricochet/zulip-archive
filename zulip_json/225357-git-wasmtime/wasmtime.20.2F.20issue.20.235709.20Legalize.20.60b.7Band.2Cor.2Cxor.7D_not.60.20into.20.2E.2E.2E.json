It correctly declares that they're equivalent expressions, but then during elaboration we pick one expression as our final choice to hand to the backend, and there's no guarantee we'll pick the one with <code>bnot</code> on the right, since the two alternatives have equal cost. I assume it's working now because elaboration happens to be picking the last-added option in the e-class in case of ties, or something like that.</p>\n<p>I think the backends need to match both patterns instead. Which is annoying, since the patterns overlap; we have to give them different priorities.</p>\n<p>I also think we need to work on helping ISLE understand commutative operators. It could generate every unique version of a rule with operands swapped, given a <code>commutative</code> flag on terms or something. We'd have to put some thought into how that interacts with overlap checking though.</p>\n</blockquote>",
