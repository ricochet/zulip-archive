I'll note that I'm no expert in <code>unsafe</code> Rust so what follows is my own personal understanding. I may have some exact specifics slightly off, but I think the high-level is right.</p>\n<p>To Rust <code>*const T</code> and <code>*mut T</code> are the same in terms of semantic guarantees. You can read from both and while the compiler requires <code>*mut T</code> to write you can <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.cast_mut\">safely cast <code>*const T</code> to <code>*mut T</code></a> so you can sort of write through a <code>*const T</code> as well. In that sense when you say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At that point we're sharing mutable pointers concurrently and all bets are off</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I believe that this is incorrect. If we were talking about <code>&amp;mut T</code> then I believe your statement is correct, but <code>*mut T</code> is different in this regard.</p>\n<p>The way I sort of think of it is that <code>&amp;mut T</code> is statically safe and <code>*mut T</code> must be \"runtime safe\". When a <code>*mut T</code> is mutated it must, at that time, be the only mutator. When <code>*mut T</code> isn't actually being accessed though you can have as many floating around as you'd like.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Could we get this documented in LinearMemory to guide implementors?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Definitely makes sense to me to improve the documentation here! </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example, is it correct to assume that as_ptr will never be called from different threads on the same instance if wasm threads and shared memory are not involved?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To answer this: probably not. The <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html#method.data\"><code>Memory::data</code></a> API only requires <code>&amp;Store&lt;T&gt;</code> which means that it can be called concurrently on many threads. This exact API does not literally call <code>LinearMemory::as_ptr</code> but it theoretically could from the runtime's perspective. So you shouldn't rely on being only called on one thread at a time, even when wasm threads aren't involved.</p>\n<p>Note, though, that you can create <code>*mut u8</code> from <code>&amp;[u8]</code> via <code>foo.as_ptr().cast_mut()</code> in safe Rust.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can this Sync requirement be lifted altogether?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No. </p>\n<p>The reasoning here is a little nuanced, but the main idea is that everything about <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> is required to make anything about <code>wasmtime::Store&lt;T&gt;</code> both <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>. Note, however, that <code>Sync</code> does not mean \"no interior mutability\" nor \"no mutation\". For example <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> is <code>Sync</code> despite allowing mutation, explicitly because all mutation requires <code>&amp;mut T</code>. Also note that types like <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>AtomicUsize</code> are both <code>Sync</code> while allowing interior mutation.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That's a lot of words, but my hunch is it won't be the most satisfying answer to you. I'm more than happy to keep answering questions though! We can also chat on Zulip for something a little less async if you'd like too.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Reviewing some code we may not actually end up using <code>LinearMemory</code> implementations for wasm shared memory with wasm threads, but that's sort of a bug in Wasmtime where the intention is that they're still used. I think this is just an oversight.</p>\n<p>Otherwise though you're correct that (2) is the main Wasmtime-related thing to guarantee here, and yes custom memories when used with wasm threads can be mutated by wasm in multiple threads. It might be worth clarifying though that <code>as_ptr(&amp;self) -&gt; *mut T</code>, when called, does not represent an intent-to-mutate. It's possible to mutate with <code>unsafe</code> code but part of that contract of the <code>unsafe</code> is that it's done safely with respect to other mutations.</p>\n<p>What I can say, though, is that if you're not dealing with shared memory then, yes, Wasmtime guarantees that mutations to memory will happen in at most one thread at a time. That's guaranteed by the nature of requiring <code>&amp;mut Store&lt;T&gt;</code> whenever the memory is mutated and that mutable borrow serves as proof of \"I'm the thread allowed to mutate right now\"</p>\n</blockquote>",
