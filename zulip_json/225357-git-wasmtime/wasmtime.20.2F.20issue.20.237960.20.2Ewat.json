There are many .wats in the example, such as gcd.wat.<br>\n(module<br>\n  (func $gcd (param i32 i32) (result i32)<br>\n    (local i32)<br>\n    block  ;; label = @1<br>\n      block  ;; label = @2<br>\n        local.get 0<br>\n        br_if 0 (;@2;)<br>\n        local.get 1<br>\n        local.set 2<br>\n        br 1 (;@1;)<br>\n      end<br>\n      loop  ;; label = @2<br>\n        local.get 1<br>\n        local.get 0<br>\n        local.tee 2<br>\n        i32.rem_u<br>\n        local.set 0<br>\n        local.get 2<br>\n        local.set 1<br>\n        local.get 0<br>\n        br_if 0 (;@2;)<br>\n      end<br>\n    end<br>\n    local.get 2<br>\n  )<br>\n  (export \"gcd\" (func $gcd))<br>\n)</p>\n<p>how is it generated? I tried to use the wasm file to convert it into a .wat file, but the content code of the converted .wat file was very long and large. Running will also report an error</p>\n<p>I use golang and rust to compile wasm<br>\nHow can I generate a short and concise .wat code like gcd.wat?</p>\n</blockquote>",
