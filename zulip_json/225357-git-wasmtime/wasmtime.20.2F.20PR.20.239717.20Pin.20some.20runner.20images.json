For the <code>main.yml</code> file instead of changing everything over to a pin only do the ones that are currently failing on the <code>ubuntu-24.04</code> update. The hope is that there's only a few locations to update pinned versions in the future, and we'll need to keep an eye on CI warnings and such to know when to update these pins in the future.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

That's where the <code>*.js</code> files all use versioned images and unfortunately we need two versioned images in <code>main.yml</code>, but I'm thinking we shouldn't go \"version all the things\" in the <code>main.yml</code> file just yet.</p>\n</blockquote>",
