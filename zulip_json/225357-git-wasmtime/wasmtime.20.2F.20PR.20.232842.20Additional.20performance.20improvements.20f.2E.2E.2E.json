Modules now register their signatures with the registry upon creation and store the signature index -&gt; shared index mappings internally.</li>\n<li>Engines now register the signatures of any host functions on <code>Config</code> upon engine creation as well as store the anyfunc representations of the host functions (previously kept in <code>Store</code>).</li>\n<li>Removed <code>StoreFrameInfo</code> and <code>StackMapRegistry</code> in favor of a unified <code>ModuleRegistry</code> per-store.  The module registry can be queried based on program counter values to quickly locate the owning module.</li>\n<li>With the removal of <code>StackMapRegistry</code>, the runtime is now given a trait object to call back on for finding the stack map for a program counter value during GC. The lookup uses the existing data in <code>CompiledModule</code> which is already optimized for the search.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This PR supersedes #2820.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Normally that's stored with the export in <code>Func</code>, but <code>HostFunc</code> is shared across engines and thus the engine needs to be responsible for (stably) storing the anyfunc with the appropriate shared signature index for the engine.</p>\n<p>I'll update this with a comment.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I realize now though that the lifetime here is obvious in that this is <em>the</em> point a store retains a module's signatures, and the drop of these signatures is what deregisters.</p>\n<p>I think that this is probably fine to leave as-is, I just needed to sit and think and understand more about what was going on</p>\n</blockquote>",
