In particular, are you trying to do some sort of analysis or transform on the codebase? Interest in the \"mechanism of wasmtime\" is fairly vague; I could also imagine that meaning just interested in how the engine works, in which case, the source code is the best material to study. I imagine you have some more particular idea in mind though, or else you wouldn't be asking this!</p>\n</blockquote>",

It is very convenient to use llvm IR to do this kind of thing. But I have been unable to find how to get the complete llvm IR in the rust documentation, for example, the functions in the dependent external crate are missing. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/122651-general/topic/Generate.20all-in-one.20llvm.20bitcode.20file.20for.20projects\">in this page</a>, I got some useful advice, and I think I can continue my work.
