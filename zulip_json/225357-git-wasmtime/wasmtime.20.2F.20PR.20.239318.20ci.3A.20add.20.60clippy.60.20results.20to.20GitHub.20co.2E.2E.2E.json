This change would collect all of those warnings, put them in [SARIF] form, and list them in GitHub's code scanning view. I recently added this to <code>ittapi</code> and it looks like this: [Code Scanning]. This means warnings and errors will show up on the security tab as a notification; the UI allows one to dismiss the warnings. There might be some integration with PRs but I haven't experimented with that.</p>\n<p>I configured this to also run periodically (every Tuesday night); we can remove that if we only want commits to <code>main</code>, e.g. If we do adopt this, we should think about what to do with the <code>clippy</code> job in <code>main.yml</code>--does it stay or go?</p>\n<p>[SARIF]: <a href=\"https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net\">https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net</a><br>\n[Code Scanning]: <a href=\"https://github.com/intel/ittapi/security/code-scanning?query=branch%3Amaster+\">https://github.com/intel/ittapi/security/code-scanning?query=branch%3Amaster+</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Or at least for the \"run continuously and have a dashboard\" aspect I don't think this'll be too useful without other changes.</p>\n<p>Now better surfacing errors in CI to PRs, that sounds great! Do you have an example of what that might look like? Ideally we could surface things like normal compile errors too, but I'm not sure how it works. Or could you perhaps enable a new clippy lint on this PR and we can see what the UI looks like? (assuming enabling a new clippy lint will have lots of errors)</p>\n<p>For exploring this a bit, it looks like the links you have (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/intel/ittapi/security/code-scanning?query=branch%3Amaster+\">Code Scanning</a>) are unfortunately only available to maintainers. (it's a 404 for me). I think that means that the dashboard access wouldn't be accessible to contributors-at-large and instead just maintainers?</p>\n<p>I can also expand a bit more on the Clippy bits we have in that you're right that we allow-by-default all clippy lints and then selectively enable them. One of the purposes for this is that it's not always the easiest to get PRs from contributors that run <code>cargo clippy</code> and then make thousands of lines of changes to appease clippy. Clippy's defaults are, at least in my opinion, not always the best suggestions and are not universally applicable. This means that the allow-by-default policy isn't just because we want clean CI, it's also that we don't want to get accidentally overburdened by contributors sending clippy fixes.</p>\n<p>So overall I'd love to get a better UI for surfacing CI errors into PRs, but I don't think that some of the other benefits you've outlined will be as applicable to us?</p>\n</blockquote>",

The only caveat is that it'll want to have some motivation for why it's applicable to Wasmtime or general agreement that Clippy's suggestions are \"basically alwasy right\" and not accidentally reducing the quality fo the code. For example <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9025\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9025</a> enabled a clippy lint for the whole workspace and <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9209\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9209</a> enabled a lint for just one tree of modules.</p>\n<p>This reminds me that we should document this policy...</p>\n</blockquote>",
