If you donâ€™t set it, by default the memory will be static. I note that setting <code>static_memory_maximum_size</code> to anything less than 4GB on my platform results in wasm using dynamic memory and setting it above that it uses static memory. So the maximum memory (in my case anyway) is 4GB. I can see in the code that it sets the default of 4GB, but I cannot see how this is configurable, if it is? </p>\n<p>I also note that for my wasm module the memory starts at 22 pages (of size 64K each). On top of that I can only allocate about 1/3 of 4GB before the allocations in the wasm module fail, even though the device has 16GB memory and not running much more than the wasm host and the wasmtime max memory is at 4GB. This observed 1/3 of 4 GB limit is present whether wasmtime uses dynamic memory (<code>static_memory_maximum_size(0)</code>) or static memory. Does this make sense? </p>\n</blockquote>",
