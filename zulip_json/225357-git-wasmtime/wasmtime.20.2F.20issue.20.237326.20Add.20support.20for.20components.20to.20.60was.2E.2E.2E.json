I have developed a component model value encoding (and library) called <a href=\"https://github.com/lann/wave\">WAVE</a> which could be used for this. </p>\n<p>I see a few ways that WAVE could be used here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The simplest extension of the existing feature would just add WAVE parsing for params:<br>\n<code>wasmtime run --invoke my-func component.wasm '\"arg1\"' 2 '[3,4]'</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A variation of this could allow \"undelimited\" values (which would require further spec/implementation work), e.g.:<br>\n<code>wasmtime run --invoke my-func component.wasm arg1 2 3,4</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A more radical change would be to change the way arguments are passed to look more like a \"normal\" function call, which might help with <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/6794\">some confusion</a> with the existing <code>--invoke</code> syntax:<br>\n<code>wasmtime run --invoke 'my-func(\"arg1\", 2, [3, 4])'</code> component.wasm</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make some other even more radical (breaking, probably) change to how <code>--invoke</code> works </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have implemented <a href=\"https://github.com/lann/wave-tank\">a prototype</a> of the \"function call\" encoding option 3, though I would actually prefer the \"undelimited\" option 2 if the params could appear immediately after the function name.</p>\n</blockquote>",

There is <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7326#issuecomment-1774197415\">some nuance</a> just in identifying an export, but I don't see much downside to starting with a very constrained/explicit implementation (nullary, fully-qualified export name), especially if there is a rough idea of how to extend it from there.</p>\n</blockquote>",
