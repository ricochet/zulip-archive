This means that the CLI, for example, can't<br>\nlimit memory growth by default and memories are only limited in size by<br>\nwhat the OS can give and the wasm's own memory type. This configuration<br>\noption means that the CLI can artificially limit the size of wasm linear<br>\nmemories.</p>\n<p>Additionally another motivation for this is for testing out various<br>\ncodegen ramifications of static/dynamic memories. This is the only way<br>\nto force a static memory, by default, for wasm64 memories with no<br>\nmaximum size listed for example.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
