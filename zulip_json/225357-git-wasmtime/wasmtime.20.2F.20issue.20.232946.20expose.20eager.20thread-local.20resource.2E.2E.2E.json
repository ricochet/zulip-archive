We haven't measured, and I don't think signal handler installation takes especially long, but we wanted this functionality so that we could eliminate the possibility from any sort of performance issue we hit at runtime, or debugging any sort of interaction with other parts of the process that install signal handlers.</p>\n<p>I don't feel extremely strongly about this but @acfoltzer advocated for it, and my judgement was the trouble it might save us debugging one day is worth exposing this implementation detail.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Could you expand the documentation with some possible use cases though? I'd also prefer if the tokio example didn't get updated to use it because it feels like it's mostly just boilerplate for most use cases and not all that necessary.
