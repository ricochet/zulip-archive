Given a Wasm module, it compiles the module to native code and then writes a standalone HTML file that gives a split pane view between the WAT and ASM disassemblies.</p>\n<p>THIS IS VERY MUCH AN MVP!!! Tons of stuff we could do with this, very little it actually does so far.</p>\n<p>Usage:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">wasmtime</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">explore</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">test</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">wasm</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">o</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">test</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">explore</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">html</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">$</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">xdg</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">open</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">test</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">explore</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">html</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Once visiting the HTML page, you can hover over lines of WAT or asm and the corresponding lines will be highlighted. You can also click to scroll the corresponding line into view.</p>\n<p>Here is a little screen recording, although the mouse itself isn't captured so it is a little hard to see what is going on:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74571/224199689-6980f0f6-e4bc-4d86-95a3-d536dcc71785.webm\">Screencast from 2023-03-09 17-22-06.webm</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
