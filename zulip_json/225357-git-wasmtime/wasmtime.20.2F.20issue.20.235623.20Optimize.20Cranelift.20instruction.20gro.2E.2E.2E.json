(For example, <code>udivrem_1</code> and <code>udivrem_2</code>, although it would be nice if we named the results instead of numbering them.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When used as a constructor, this term builds the instruction if it isn't already in the GVN map, then returns the requested result.</li>\n<li>When used as an extractor, this term matches if some value in the given e-class is the requested result of a matching instruction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key implementation challenge here is that the GVN map is not currently usable this way. Right now it maps an <code>InstructionData</code> to a <code>Value</code>, but we need it to map to an <code>Inst</code> instead. That may require changes throughout the equality saturation phase; I haven't dug into it enough to work out the details.</p>\n<p>If we have all of that, then I don't think we need any new ISLE terms like <code>two_results</code> or <code>with_provides</code>. Instead, rewrite <code>(udiv ty x y)</code> to <code>(udivrem_1 ty x y)</code> (and perhaps _vice versa_), and let elaboration sort out whether the more complex instruction is worth-while. In particular I think we need to ensure that the cost model satisfies these constraints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cost(<code>udiv</code>) &lt; cost(<code>udivrem</code>)</li>\n<li>cost(<code>urem</code>) &lt; cost(<code>udivrem</code>)</li>\n<li>cost(<code>udiv</code>) + cost(<code>urem</code>) &gt; cost(<code>udivrem</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One more thing, regarding whether this <code>udivrem</code> optimization is machine-specific: The aarch64 example is interesting because it shows that this optimization is worth-while even on targets which don't have a dedicated instruction for this. Since the lowering of <code>urem</code> has to compute the result of <code>udiv</code> first, we should reuse that result if it's needed elsewhere. I think this fused instruction will turn out to be worth having on all targets, because it describes an arithmetic identity that is target-independent.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We identified a problem: the cost-function can't currently accurately account for instructions with multiple results.</p>\n<p>If two results from the same instruction are both used, the cost of that instruction ideally would only be counted once. Unfortunately, the individual results may each be used through an arbitrarily long chain of other instructions before being demanded in some context where we must have both results. So the current dynamic-programming approach to computing the cost function can't see that it's ever worth using <code>udivrem</code> if <code>udiv</code> is cheaper.</p>\n<p>We suspect fixing this is NP-hard, though we haven't bothered figuring out which problem it reduces to. Chris mentioned it felt like set cover, maybe. On further thought I guess a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming\">zero-one integer linear programming</a> solver would be a natural fit for this problem, and that's one of Karp's original NP-complete problems.
