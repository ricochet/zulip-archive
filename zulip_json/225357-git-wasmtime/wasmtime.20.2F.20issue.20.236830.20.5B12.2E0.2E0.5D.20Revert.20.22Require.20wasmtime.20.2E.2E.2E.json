I'm driving back from Chicago on Thursday so I may be around but may also be somewhere in the middle of I-80 and I'm pretty sure zooming-and-driving is not recommended. Deferring should help make the timing around this change a bit more comfy.</p>\n<p>I'll be sure to update the release notes on <code>main</code> for this change, and they haven't been backported to this branch yet so no need to update the 12.0.0 branch yet.</p>\n</blockquote>",
