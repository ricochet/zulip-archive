If compilation time is a big enough concern I can add the cargo feature back. I opted to enable <code>winch</code> by default for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It substantially reduces the <code>cfg</code> complexity -- at first I thought I had covered all the places in which a <code>cfg</code> check would be needed, but then I realized that I missed the Cranelift specific compiler flags.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It's the fastest route to enable winch by default in the fuzzers, which we want to do eventually -- the only change we'd need at that point would be to get rid of the winch-specific environment variable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We can get rid of the winch-specific checks in CI for fuzzing</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed.
