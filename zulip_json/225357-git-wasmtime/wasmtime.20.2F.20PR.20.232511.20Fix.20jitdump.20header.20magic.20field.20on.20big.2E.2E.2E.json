(This allows<br>\nconsumers of the file to detect the endianness of the platform<br>\nwhere the file was written, and apply it when reading other fields.)</p>\n<p>However, current code always writes 0x4A695444 in little-endian<br>\nbyte order, even on big-endian system.  This makes consumers fail<br>\nwhen attempting to read files written on big-endian platforms.</p>\n<p>Fixed by always writing the magic in native endianness.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
