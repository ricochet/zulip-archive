The DWARF5 standard is pretty much unambiguous in its wording (p151):</p>\n<p><code>end_sequence</code>:<br>\nA boolean indicating that the current address is that of the first byte after the end of a sequence of target machine instructions. <code>end_sequence</code> terminates a sequence of lines; therefore other information in the same row is not meaningful.</p>\n</blockquote>",
