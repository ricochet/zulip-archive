Have you done any performance comparisons on this?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, the one example in <code>call-conv.clif</code> is actually really nice: letting RA2 use its unified move resolution lets it handle a \"shift every arg over by one\" case without any temps, whereas the old explicit-move approach required a bunch of registers and ended up encroaching into callee-saves (r13, r14, 15).</p>\n<p>Measurements on SpiderMonkey.wasm and bz2 show only small effects in the noise, so this doesn't seem to matter for those particular cases, but I'm sure I could find benchmarks where it does affect an inner loop somewhere. In any case it's a nice semantic cleanup, generates slightly smaller code, and takes us one step closer to removing the pinned vregs!</p>\n</blockquote>",
