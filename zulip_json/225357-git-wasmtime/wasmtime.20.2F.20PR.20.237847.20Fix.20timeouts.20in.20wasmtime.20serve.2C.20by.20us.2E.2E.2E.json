This commit switches to dividing the timeout by 10, and expiring an instance after 11 epochs have been observed, giving a maximum overshoot of 10%.</p>\n<p>Co-authored-by: Jamey Sharp &lt;<a href=\"mailto:jsharp@fastly.com\">jsharp@fastly.com</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
