That seems to match up with what I observe in an actual module compiled with wasi-sdk and run via Node's wasi module.</p>\n<p>This is important because it has exactly the opposite interpretation: <code>0</code> indicates a successful write, not failure.</p>\n<p>Possibly <code>nwritten</code> should be <code>*nwritten</code> also, since it's a pointer. (Specifically it's an out-parameter which is where the number of bytes written actually goes.)</p>\n</blockquote>",
