I'd love it if somebody could take enough of a look to decide which of those it is, and if it's the latter, leave a few hints here in case somebody out there wants a project to work on.</p>\n</blockquote>",

And clear it in <code>fd_seek</code> at the same time it does <code>stream.input.set(None)</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
