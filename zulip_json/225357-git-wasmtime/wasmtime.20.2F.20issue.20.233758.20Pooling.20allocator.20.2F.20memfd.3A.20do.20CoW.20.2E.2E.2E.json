This is basically like an ELF binary's image of <code>.data</code> / <code>.rodata</code>. Right now I think we have this in a condensed form (list of initializers with offsets) instead;</li>\n<li>possibly tweak the API to pass an open <code>File</code> into a new constructor for <code>Module</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
