For shared (file or anonymous) mappings this will cause the pages to be discarded and repopulated with the backing storage when you try to read it again. For private anonymous mappings it will repopulate with zero-pages when you try to read it again. So if you use <code>MADV_DONTNEED</code> when you have a shared mapping of the ELF image from a file but don't use it when you have an private anonymous mapping for non-precompiled modules I think you should be fine. You can't use it in the later case as the module may be instantiated more than once.</p>\n</blockquote>",
