The end goal of this commit is to<br>\nenable the <code>Lower</code> instruction to know the type of the component<br>\nfunction being lowered. Currently during the inlining pass where<br>\ncomponent fusion is detected the type of the lifted function is known,<br>\nbut to implement fusion entirely the type of the lowered function must<br>\nbe known. Note that these two types are expected to be different to<br>\nallow for the subtyping rules specified by the component model.</p>\n<p>For now nothing is actually done with this information other than noting<br>\nits presence in the face of a lifted-then-lowered function. My hope<br>\nthough was to split this out for a separate review to avoid making a<br>\nfuture component-adapter-compiler-containing-PR too large.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
