This setup can take on the order of a few hundred microseconds, whereas the overhead of calling WebAssembly is otherwise on the order of a few nanoseconds. This setup cost is paid once per-OS-thread. If your application is sensitive to the latencies of WebAssembly function calls, even those that happen first on a thread, then this function can be used to improve the consistency of each call into WebAssembly by explicitly frontloading the cost of the one-time setup per-thread.</p>\n<p>Note that this function is not required to be called in any embedding. Wasmtime will automatically initialize thread-local-state as necessary on calls into WebAssembly. This is provided for use cases where the latency of WebAssembly calls are extra-important, which is not necessarily true of all embeddings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
