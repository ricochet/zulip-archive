Locally I<br>\nwas seeing a lot of ooms while fuzzing and I believe it was generally<br>\ncaused from not actually having any runtime limits for wasm modules. I'm<br>\nactually surprised that this hasn't come up more on oss-fuzz more in<br>\nreality, but with a custom store limiter I think this'll get the job<br>\ndone where we have an easier knob to turn for controlling the memory<br>\nusage of fuzz-generated modules.</p>\n<p>For now I figure a 2gb limit should be good enough for limiting fuzzer<br>\nexecution. Additionally the \"out of resources\" check if instantiation<br>\nfails now looks for the <code>oom</code> flag to be set instead of pattern matching<br>\non some error messages about resources.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
