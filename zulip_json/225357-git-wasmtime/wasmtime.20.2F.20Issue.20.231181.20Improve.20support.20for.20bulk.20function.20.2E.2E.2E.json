Currently, <code>TargetIsa::emit_unwind_info</code> is designed around emitting one full record (<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/blob/c0f82dbdeca0d18c5a829463c616cc768657de3a/cranelift-codegen/src/isa/x86/fde.rs#L242-L248\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/blob/c0f82dbdeca0d18c5a829463c616cc768657de3a/cranelift-codegen/src/isa/x86/fde.rs#L242-L248\">a whole <code>.eh_frame</code></a> or the <code>UnwindInfo</code> part of a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-runtime_function\" title=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-runtime_function\">RUNTIME_FUNCTION</a>) per function, which is awkward to use in the face of multiple functions. In squaring away this interface with <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/902\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/902\">bytecodealliance/cranelift#902</a>, I've realized that to generate good unwind information through <code>cranelift-module</code>, we would have to do a lot of legwork already done by <code>gimli</code> to join all distinct <code>.eh_frame</code>, so I'd rather just build the right structures in the first place. As @philipc <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/pull/1320#discussion_r366607644\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/pull/1320#discussion_r366607644\">commented</a> the existing interface isn't entirely how <code>gimli</code> is intended to be used, either.</p>\n<p>Functionally, I want <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/blob/c0f82dbdeca0d18c5a829463c616cc768657de3a/cranelift-codegen/src/isa/x86/fde.rs#L172\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/blob/c0f82dbdeca0d18c5a829463c616cc768657de3a/cranelift-codegen/src/isa/x86/fde.rs#L172\"><code>isa::x86::fde::emit_fde</code></a> to be designed around adding to a <code>FrameTable</code> provided by <code>sink</code>, rather than constructing and writing an <code>.eh_frame</code> section for the function being described. Windows unwind info generation wouldn't have to change much, with implementors of <code>FrameUnwindSink</code> collecting an array of <code>UnwindInfo</code> rather than just one.</p>\n<p>I imagine this looking like <code>FrameUnwindSink</code> impls building a collection of records, either a <code>FrameTable</code> for <code>Libunwind</code> or a vec of <code>UnwindInfo</code> for <code>Fastcall</code>. To go along with this, I expect such impls would be added in <code>cranelift-module</code>. These may or may not be suitable for use from wasmtime, I'm optimistic that they could because in the worst case a <code>FrameUnwindSink</code> can be created, used for one function, and then discarded, preserving the current behavior.</p>\n<p>My expectation is that a trait like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>trait FrameUnwindSink {\n    /// Create an instance of the implementor for the provided unwind style.\n    fn for_style(kind: FrameUnwindKind) -&gt; Self;\n\n    /// Add a function to the sink. May panic if the function&#39;s calling convention\n    /// is not compatible with the unwind style this sink was created with.\n    fn add_function(&amp;mut self, func: &amp;Function, isa: &amp;dyn TargetIsa);\n\n    /// Serialize this sink&#39;s contents in a manner appropriate for this sink&#39;s\n    /// unwind style.\n    fn serialize(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;u8&gt;;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>should satisfy everyone's needs?</p>\n<p>The notable benefit of this is making it easy to generate a single <code>.eh_frame</code> section when using <code>cranelift-faerie</code> or <code>cranelift-object</code>, meaning <code>lucet</code> can unwind wasm, have backtraces, all that good stuff :) I imagine @bjorn3 might like this for having unwind information when using Cranelift as a <code>rustc</code> backend as well?</p>\n<p>This also seems like a good excuse to move <code>isa::x86::fde</code> and <code>isa::x86::unwind</code> to <code>isa::x86::unwind::windows</code> and <code>isa::x86::unwind::libunwind</code> respectively?</p>\n<p>cc @yurydelendik as I'd like your thoughts on this idea, and @peterhuene as I know you've also worked on unwind information here.</p>\n<p>Opening an issue to make sure this gets a design friendly to both lucet and wasmtime, rather than just tweaking <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/902\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/902\">bytecodealliance/cranelift#902</a> until something looks right :)</p>\n</blockquote>",
