(Of course those two expression have the same value in this branch of the <code>if</code>.)   In fact, I'm even wondering whether it wouldn't be cleanest to rename all those <code>ri</code> to <code>rn</code> -- that should make it more obious that a <code>AluRR { op, rd, rn, rm }</code> has identical semantic to a <code>AluRRR { op, rd, rn, rm }</code> if <code>rd</code> is tied to <code>rn</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I've been careful to ensure that the disassembly output of cranelift is always valid s390x assembler code, and could be fed right back into the assembler (e.g. to verify binary encodings).</p>\n<p>With these changes we now get lots of output that simply <em>isn't</em> valid assembler -- I'd really prefer to avoid that.  Now, I understand that the same printers in <code>mod.rs</code> are also used on the intermediate representation, and there you definitely need to see both vregs of the tied operands ...</p>\n<p>What would you think of a solution using a helper like <code>pretty_print_tied_regpair</code> or so, which would show just a single (real) register name if the two operands match, but would show something like <code>dst|src</code> (or <code>dst&lt;-src</code> or whatever) if they do not?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
