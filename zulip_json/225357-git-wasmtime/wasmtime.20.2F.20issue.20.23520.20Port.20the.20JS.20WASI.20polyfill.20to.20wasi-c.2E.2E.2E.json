In theory, all the big pieces are in place -- wasi-common provides the same functionality as Wasmtime's C implementation of WASI, Emscripten can provide the same underlying support in both cases, and the support code should roughly be the same. So the work here is in rewiring everything up in <a href=\"https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime/blob/polyfill/wasmtime-wasi/js-polyfill/wasi.js\">wasi.js</a>, and porting <a href=\"https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime/blob/polyfill/wasmtime-wasi/js-polyfill/polyfill.c\">polyfill.c</a> to Rust, probably splitting out that <code>EM_ASM</code> into a standalone JS file.</p>\n<p>I've marked this \"help wanted\" -- if someone's interested in doing this port, that'd be great (and I can help mentor), but it'd even help just to have more ideas for packaging, binding, or other ways we could make the polyfill better. The current support code and <a href=\"https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime/blob/polyfill/wasmtime-wasi/js-polyfill/shell.html\">shell.html</a> is super minimal.</p>\n</blockquote>",
