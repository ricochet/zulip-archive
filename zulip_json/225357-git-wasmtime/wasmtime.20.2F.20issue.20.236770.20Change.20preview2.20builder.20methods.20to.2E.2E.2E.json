Yes, we got rid of all the public &amp;mut self methods on preview 2 WasiCtx that could substitute for the builder, mostly because of interactions with the table. So, now the WasiCtxBuilder is the only way to set things up.</p>\n<p>We can switch all the builders to &amp;mut self if you think that is better ergonomics. I dont particularly love that <code>.build()</code> is &amp;mut self, because unlike in the Command case the builder has taken ownership of various resources and I liked to see <code>.build()</code> transferring that ownership to the WasiCtx (in addition to making it impossible to build it twice). But at the end of the day its just syntax, so whatever.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It's not the end of the world, but it <em>is</em> somewhat unwieldy.
