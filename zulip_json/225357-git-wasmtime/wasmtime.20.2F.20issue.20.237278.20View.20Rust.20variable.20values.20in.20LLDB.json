Please fill out the TODOs below.</p>\n<h4>Feature</h4>\n<p>I'd like to be able to see the values of the variables in my Rust code that I've compiled to WASM when debugging with LLDB. Currently when using CodeLLDB to debug Rust compiled in debug mode, the only variable present is <code>__vmctx</code>. </p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>This would make it a lot simpler to debug incorrect state in programs and generally understand a misbehaving program.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
