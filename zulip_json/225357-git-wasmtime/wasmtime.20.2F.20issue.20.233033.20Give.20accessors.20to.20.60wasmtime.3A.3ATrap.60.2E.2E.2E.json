Is the main goal to print the error without printing the backtrace?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, this is exactly my goal. Actually in our embedding the backtrace is post-processed for display, mainly for function names demangling, but now I'm seeing that Wasmtime does that for us. Our display tries to be minimal and display a bit less information, though. So getting the user-generated error message allows us to customize the error message that we display.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it shouldn't be printed by Display for Trap </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that <code>Display</code> for <code>Trap</code> doesn't iterate on an error sequence, but only shows the <code>TrapReason</code> and the backtrace generated from the frames. Am I missing something? In any case, I'm happy to provide an alternative <code>error()</code> accessor that returns the plain error (and keep the <code>source()</code> implementation as it was before this PR), or just to remove this last commit (if we can agree on getting the user message accessor).</p>\n</blockquote>",

A <code>Display</code> implementation for an error should print the message for just that error, and higher level libraries which generate reports, such as <code>anyhow::Error</code>, will do the iteration. I think that if you print out <code>anyhow::Error</code> where there's a trap inside (printed using <code>{:?}</code> which is <code>anyhow</code>'s way of printing the full error backtrace) then you'll see the error printed twice.</p>\n<p>I do think it's fine to implement <code>source</code> , though, it just involves not printing the error itself when we're of that variant. Instead a placeholder like \"user-generated error\" would be printed instead.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Looking at <code>anyhow</code> it looks like explicit opt-in is required to enable backtraces (via env vars). This means that backtraces wouldn't be captured by default, but you could opt-in on a per-execution basis to doing so.</p>\n<p>Would something like that be reasonable for y'all? It would be nice to somewhere have a <code>note: use WASMTIME_BACKTRACE=1 to get a backtrace</code>, but I'm not sure if <code>impl Display for Trap</code> is the best location to put that. I'm not sure where it would go...</p>\n<p>Even if we go that route though I feel like we may still want this method so, even when backtraces are enabled, there's a specific way to print just the reason without the backtrace.</p>\n</blockquote>",
