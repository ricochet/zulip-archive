I am especially interested in armv7 little endian support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the value of adding this in Cranelift?<br>\nEmit code that could run on ARM architecture.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>\n  algorithms to use?<br>\nAt first i want to add basic integer operations followed by floating point instructions. I thought about implementing the latter using VFP rather than the NEON extension (As far as I know NEON does not support double precision). As for calling convention, I would like to implement AAPCS.<br>\n I already have some code that i hope to push after necessary modifications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they better<br>\n  or worse than your proposal?<br>\nNo, but I am open to suggestions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
