This tries to draw on both of those PRs a bit to end up with something that's usable by the majority of the backend for use with branches.</p>\n<p>I've attempted to break things up piecemeal here so the commits in theory are understandable commit-by-commit. This additionally doesn't implement every single optimization I could think of, mostly just a few that seemed to be the low-hanging fruit ones.</p>\n</blockquote>",

So there is a chance that in some of the 32bit constants that we miss we may not sign extend them.</p>\n<p>I've built a small test to check which constants fail to generate, and the lowest one is <code>0x7FFF_F801</code> so all the negatives are covered. So I don't think there's anything wrong here.</p>\n<p>It might be worth ensuring that the value is sign extended before emitting it to the constant pool anyway. Or switching to <code>lw</code> that only loads 4 bytes and sign extends the load result. Just to make sure that this doesn't happen in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>",
