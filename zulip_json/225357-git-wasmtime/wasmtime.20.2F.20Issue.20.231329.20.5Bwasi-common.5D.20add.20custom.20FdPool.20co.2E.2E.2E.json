Here's the summary of the changes:</p>\n<p>The underlying type in <code>FdPool</code> which we use to track and represent raw file descriptors is now <code>u32</code>. As a result, the structure of <code>FdPool</code> is simplified massively as we no longer need to track the claimed descriptors; in a way, we trust the caller to return the handle after it's done with it. In case the caller decides to be clever and return a handle which was not yet legally allocated, we panic. This should never be a problem in <code>wasi-common</code> unless we hit a bug.</p>\n<p>To make all of this work, <code>Fd</code> trait is modified to require two methods: <code>as_raw(&amp;self) -&gt; u32</code> and <code>from_raw(raw_fd: u32) -&gt; Self</code> both of which are used to convert to and from the <code>FdPool</code>'s underlying type <code>u32</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
