Installation means different things to different people and understanding what you're looking for can assist in guiding what needs to be written in documentation. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you looking to embed the Rust <code>wasmtime</code> crate in your own application? </li>\n<li>Do you want to execute program with the <code>wasmtime</code> CLI? If so what kind of programs?</li>\n<li>Do you want to embed Wasmtime in a non-Rust application? If so which language? How do you want to distribute the final artifacts?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's a different path for each of these so I think it would be good to clarify which one you're looking for.</p>\n</blockquote>",
