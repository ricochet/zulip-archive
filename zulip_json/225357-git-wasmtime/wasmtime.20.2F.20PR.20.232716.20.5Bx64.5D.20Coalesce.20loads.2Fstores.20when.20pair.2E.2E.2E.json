In the Cranelift backend, we pattern match to perform the following conversions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>load + insertlane</code> becomes a single <code>PINSR*</code></li>\n<li><code>extractlane + store</code> becomes a single <code>PEXTR*</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This change adds CLIF tests that should pass once the necessary pattern-matching issues are fixed.<br>\n&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
