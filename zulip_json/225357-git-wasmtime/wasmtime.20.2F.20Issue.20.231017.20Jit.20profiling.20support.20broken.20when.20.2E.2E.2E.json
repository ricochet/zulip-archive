It seems clear that using the rust allocator (calls malloc eventually) instead of mmap breaks jitdump support, but I have not pinpointed a way for confirmation to understand mitigations that don't require reverting to mmap. Here <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/cover/622238/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/cover/622238/\">https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/cover/622238/</a> and here <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/622240/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/622240/\">https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/622240/</a> it appears it is implied that perf is using mmap records in the perf.dat file to help determine the injection points for the jitted code captured in the jitdump file. That makes sense but when doing something like: \"sudo perf script --input perf.data --show-mmap-events  | grep MMAP\" to print mmaps recorded, data files both before and after the allocator change appear consistent. I am convinced thought the issue lies with perf inject not being able to figure out how to inject the jitted code. I'll do more digging.</p>\n<p>@yurydelendik @alexcrichton In the meantime note ittapi for vtune support has been rebased and is not hampered by the allocator change and so <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/819\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/819\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/819</a> is unaffected. </p>\n</blockquote>",

In the screen shots below you can see the difference. The left is when malloc is used to create the instance versus the right when mmap is used. I don't feel comfortable not understanding why perf needs this region to be mmaped notes from the posted conversations about the patches imply that is the case. During perf inject you can see perf have trouble accessing an map file in temp that should be associated with the pid of the process and it not have trouble on the mmapped version, but things aren't crystal clear. I am going through the perf kernel code now to see if I can understand better.<br>\nperf report (left is using the malloc patch, right is with it removed)<br>\n![image](<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45402135/76563624-02d1cd80-6465-11ea-8cea-883a262f559c.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45402135/76563624-02d1cd80-6465-11ea-8cea-883a262f559c.png\">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45402135/76563624-02d1cd80-6465-11ea-8cea-883a262f559c.png</a>)</p>\n<p>perf report with drill down into annotation<br>\n![image](<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45402135/76563649-0c5b3580-6465-11ea-8ee7-2b84e9aa818d.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45402135/76563649-0c5b3580-6465-11ea-8ee7-2b84e9aa818d.png\">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45402135/76563649-0c5b3580-6465-11ea-8ee7-2b84e9aa818d.png</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>",

Either that or I suspect there's bugs in how there's tons of dwarf in a normal wasm file from rustc which is related to libstd, but most of libstd isn't present in the wasm file itself. (and maybe there's dwarf lacking for the functions generated in the file?)</p>\n<p>After reviewing the code a bit I think that we may want to refactor this quite a bit? One improvement I can think of is that the <code>--jitdump</code> flag shouldn't require <code>-g</code>, and without <code>-g</code> we should still emit a code load entry per-function instead of one per-module. We've got the metadata to know where all the functions are and we at least have the name section. I think the way the code should be structured is that we always emit one code load entry per function in a wasm module, and then optionally, if available, we emit extra debuginfo entries as well.</p>\n<p>I haven't really looked too too much into the debuginfo processing itself, but I think that the general output of the jitdump module will be improved if debuginfo is only augmenting existing records rather than driving the emission of records. My current suspicion is that the debuginfo augmentation is perhaps buggy right now which leads <code>perf inject</code> to run amok when parsing the dump file, leading to corrupted annotations and misinformation.</p>\n<p>I'm not really sure why it worked before or after the mmap/malloc change. I read over the patches you linked and I don't think that it has anything to do with the mmap/malloc change that we made. We made a change of how an <code>Instance</code> is allocated but it doesn't really have anything to do with JIT code or anything like that. The best I could surmise is that <code>mmap</code> is just required for the <em>dump</em> file to happen at runtime, so <code>perf inject</code> knows how to find the dump file at all. It didn't even look, though, like <code>mmap</code>-business was required for the code itself.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Thanks for poking around here. note, I am not using -g in the experiments above so I'd like to reproduce what you've done since that shouldn't be an issue for me either. In general, the -g is not required. It is only an option to take advantage of dwarf included in the wasm to include line information in the annotation. If dwarf isn't included the jitdump should still be generated without issue, but perhaps there is something more there to look at even when the flag isn't used.</p>\n<p>What steps can I use to reproduce your findings? BTW .. I have a habit of using C .. my fib wasm file is actually compiled from C using Clang and includes dwarf debug but I should also try the version that doesn't. I should also try your Rust version ... but that didn't run on my HEAD due to the bug you pointed out.</p>\n<p>\"The best I could surmise is that mmap is just required for the dump file to happen at runtime, so perf inject knows how to find the dump file at all. It didn't even look, though, like mmap-business was required for the code itself.\"</p>\n<p>What are you thinking here? The jitdump file needs to mmap'd during running so that it is injected into the original perf file. Ok, I think I see. Yes, I think you are correct. Perhaps using mmap to create this jitdump file is the only extra mmap requirement and the problem indeed is something else. This is good. Let me try your steps to reproduce. Was your experiment done with HEAD on a rust generated wasm file with no debug information?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Without debuginfo it should work though.</p>\n<p>In any case, I've been using <code>-g</code> this whole time <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/e495570f07613204ad3b6fd04d22d80b4852a4eb/crates/profiling/src/jitdump.rs#L7\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/e495570f07613204ad3b6fd04d22d80b4852a4eb/crates/profiling/src/jitdump.rs#L7\">because of this comment</a> but actually wasmtime from master works for me without <code>-g</code>. Using the master branch I see: <code>99.90%  wasmtime  jitted-25162-0.so   [.] wasm_module</code>. I think the only issue is that the entire wasm module is lumped into one function instead of being split apart (but my commit fixes that).</p>\n<p>In that sense I don't actually need any changes to get <code>perf</code> working <em>without</em> <code>-g</code>, and only with <code>-g</code> do things start going awry.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I recently noticed though that the jitdump is suddenly no longer resolving properly when doing a perf report. I've traced the issue to a patch submitted right before merging the perf jitdump patch that apparently my last manual end-to-end tests weren't rebased against before it merged. It is the patch <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/948\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/948\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/948</a> which does away with mmap in favor a mechanism that uses the alloc crate which I believe uses malloc when creating instances in memory. There are no rust errors and perf report -v does not show any errors, but I think this is fatal to perf jit support (and maybe any jit support of wasmtime) because perf is trying to mmap that jitted memory region and afaik you can't mmap a malloc'd region. This theory may be incomplete, but certainly doing a \"git revert -n b15b5cd05\" resolves the issue. Not sure the best way forward here.</p>\n<p>Also this brings up a gap in testing where I am not sure how to automatically test the breakage of external tools such as the issue here. </p>\n</blockquote>",
