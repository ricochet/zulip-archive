There's also a few minor changes from recent advisories such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We'll no longer use the publish-the-changes-from-the-advisory feature from GitHub. That basically just doesn't work any more.</li>\n<li>PRs will instead be manually created to have CI run on them to weed out any issues.</li>\n<li>Details about preparing the <code>main</code> branch ahead of the release are interleaved with the rest of the runbook.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The intention is to supplement the official runbook with Wasmtime-specific information and flesh out a few minor steps we're following that are \"extra\" here too.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
