At the moment, shifts of 64-bit values are legalized to PSLLQ/PSRLQ (#1612) but there's no other applicable legalization rule at all. I wasn't sure what's a good way to legalize 64-bit shifts on 32-bit platforms so I went with the SIMD route that was similar to existing code. Suggestions for a better approach very much welcome!</p>\n</blockquote>",
