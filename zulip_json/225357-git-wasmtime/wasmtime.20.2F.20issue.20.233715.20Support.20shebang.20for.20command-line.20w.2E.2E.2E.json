This is something all other script runners (perl, python, miniscript, etc. etc.) do, and the shebang is not part of the grammar of those languages either; it's just something the script runners are prepared to deal with.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a shebang doesn't make any sense in other contexts, e.g. in a .wat file that's part of a Visual Studio project.  So I wouldn't expect to see it in the .wat spec itself.  It _only_ makes sense for people who (like me) are trying to use wasmtime like other command-line scripts, so it ought to just be something that wasmtime does.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It's a matter of convenience.  I have a lot of scripts in a lot of different languages; I don't have to remember what tool to use to run them because they all understand shebang — except for wasmtime.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>Just special-case it: if the first line of the script file starts with \"#!\", then ignore it and continue with the rest of the file.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>I could write, for every wasm script I want to run, a little 2-line shell script that runs wasmtime with the path to the actual script.
