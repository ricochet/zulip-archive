As a result, some CI<br>\nruns seem to fail depending on which versions of crates they download. A<br>\ncommon failure mode is that two different versions of the <code>syn</code> crate<br>\nget into the build somehow, resulting in errors in wiggle/witx.</p>\n<p>This change simply adds the <code>--locked</code> flag to the <code>cargo test</code> run for<br>\nthe new x64 backend.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
