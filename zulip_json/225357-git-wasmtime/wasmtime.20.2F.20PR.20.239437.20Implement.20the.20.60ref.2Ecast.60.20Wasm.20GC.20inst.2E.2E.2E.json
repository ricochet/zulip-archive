Would it make sense to update <code>translate_ref_test</code> with an argument along the lines of \"what to do as the conclusion\"? For example here the <code>trapz</code> could get propagated upwards to avoid creating so many basic blocks as part of <code>translate_ref_test</code>. For <code>BrOnCast</code> and friend it could be used for \"I already created the blocks and I'm telling you where to jump\".</p>\n<p>Basically there's cleanups we can do here in the frontend which Cranelift will not do in the mid-end. I don't know whether the better answer is to invest in the mid-end, assume that <code>MachBuffer</code> cleans up everything, or try to produce better IR here in the first place.</p>\n</blockquote>",
