This moves the initialization to<br>\n<code>Store</code> instead which means that we'll call this at least once per<br>\nthread, which some platforms may need (none currently do, they all only<br>\nneed per-program initialization, but Fuchsia will need per-thread<br>\ninitialization).</p>\n</blockquote>",
