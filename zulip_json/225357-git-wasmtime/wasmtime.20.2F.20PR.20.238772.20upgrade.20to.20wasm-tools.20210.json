I used get(0) but this is an arbitrary choice. This comes up in the upgrade of wit-bindgen as well.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

There's some follow-up work to <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/1577\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/pull/1577</a> to improve world selection, so let me try to get that in today to update to that. Otherwise <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wit-component/latest/wit_component/fn.resolve_world_from_name.html\"><code>wit_component::resolve_world_from_name</code></a> is the rough equivalent of what to do but I'd like to change that too.</p>\n</blockquote>",
