Previously it would<br>\nallocate a page-size of <code>chunk</code> plus some space in hash sets for future<br>\ninsertions. The main trick here implemented is that after the first gc<br>\nduring the slow path the fast chunk allocation is allocated and<br>\nconfigured.</p>\n<p>The motivation for this PR is that given our recent work to further<br>\nrefine and optimize the instantiation process this allocation started to<br>\nshow up in a nontrivial fashion. Most modules today never touch this<br>\ntable anyway as almost none of them use reference types, so the time<br>\nspent allocation and deallocating the table per-store was largely wasted<br>\ntime.</p>\n<p>Concretely on a microbenchmark this PR speeds up instantiation of a<br>\nmodule with one function by 30%, decreasing the instantiation cost from<br>\n1.8us to 1.2us. Overall a pretty minor win but when the instantiation<br>\ntimes we're measuring start being in the single-digit microseconds this<br>\nwin ends up getting magnified!</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
