Since it's impractical to update the list of allowed characters every time a language that<br>\ncompiles to Wasm generates symbols slightly differently, allow all graphic ASCII characters instead.</p>\n<p>(Tests don't need updating.)</p>\n</blockquote>",

My gut is that something will go wrong if random emoji is fed to <code>objdump</code> and/or mixing in things like right-to-left and left-to-right characters and things like that, but I've got no concrete evidence and everything might handle it all just fine.</p>\n<p>In any case I think adjustments along the lines of this definitely make sense and are fine to land without trying to investigate deeply how tooling reacts to these symbols (since it's probably all fine anyway)</p>\n</blockquote>",
