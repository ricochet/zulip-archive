When checking the size of each array with <code>region_sizes</code>, the<br>\nsize of <code>defined_memories</code> and <code>owned_memories</code> were checked in this<br>\norder. But <code>region_sizes</code> is iterating through the fields in the reverse<br>\norder. This change reverses the field order to fix the associated fuzz<br>\nbug.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
