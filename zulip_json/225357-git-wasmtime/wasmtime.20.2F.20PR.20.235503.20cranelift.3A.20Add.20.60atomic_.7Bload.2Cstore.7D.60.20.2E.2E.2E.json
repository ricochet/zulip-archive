Then the cases below are, in order: <code>InstructionFormat::LoadNoOffset</code>, <code>InstructionFormat::StoreNoOffset</code>, <code>InstructionFormat::Store</code>, <code>InstructionFormat::Load</code>. Any other format should panic with <code>unimplemented!()</code>. That captures what we actually wanted to know about the opcode: we don't care whether it's atomic or whether it's a store, we just need to know how to construct the right <code>InstructionData</code>.</p>\n<p>This also highlights that the <code>offset</code> value returned from <code>generate_load_store_address</code> is unused for these atomic ops. I expect to get slightly better fuzzing results if we avoid generating a random number that we then ignore. How about returning a <code>max_offset</code> instead and only doing the <code>int_in_range</code> call in the <code>Store</code> and <code>Load</code> format cases?</p>\n</blockquote>",
