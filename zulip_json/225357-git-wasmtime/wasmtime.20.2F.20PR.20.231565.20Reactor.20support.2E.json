This means that we're splitting the world between \"instantiate this module\" and \"instantiate this wasi module\". These constructor semantics need to be bubbled to all callers and such. </p>\n<p>Would it be possible to avoid splitting into two worlds? One option might be to have this instead of a constructor:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"k\">impl</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Instance</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">initialize_wasi</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"nb\">Result</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nb\">Option</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">Instance</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Error</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"c1\">// ...</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>That way you'd always create the <code>Instance</code> the same way and it's up to you what to do with it after that.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I've heard of other toolchains using it as well, as it sort of gives people what they want -- \"just export my stuff\". Except that <code>--export-dynamic</code> was implemented in wasm-ld to handle the Emscripten-specific dynamic linking scheme used in Emscripten, so it also does some additional things that Emscripten needs like exporting <code>__heap_base</code> and <code>__data_end</code>, even when we aren't using Emscripten. So we have a multi-project backwards compatibility knot to untie before we can fix this.</p>\n<p>In general, it doesn't make sense for Commands to export globals, tables, or memories, because those are all about state, and Commands don't have any state, except when one of their exported functions is being called.</p>\n</blockquote>",
