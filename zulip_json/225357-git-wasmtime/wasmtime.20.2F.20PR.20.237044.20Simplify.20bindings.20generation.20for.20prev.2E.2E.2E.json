Previously this was separated out (I think) to handle some methods being <code>async</code> and not others, but the <code>bindgen!</code> macro has since grown the capability to have some functions async and not all.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
