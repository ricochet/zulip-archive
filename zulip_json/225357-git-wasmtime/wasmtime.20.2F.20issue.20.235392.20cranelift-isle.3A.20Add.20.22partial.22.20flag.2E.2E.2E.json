They were byte-for-byte identical. In conjunction with the fact that none of the precise-output filetests failed on any backend, I have pretty good confidence that this didn't change the results of instruction selection.</p>\n<p>I had thought this PR might marginally improve performance in the instruction selection phase of compiling, due to fewer checks for whether constructors returned <code>Option::Some</code>.</p>\n<p>When measuring time spent in <code>wasmtime compile</code> on Spidermonkey with DHAT, this PR reduces instructions retired by 0.06%, at the cost of 0.0007% more bytes read and 0.0001% more bytes written. Somehow this PR increased total heap allocations by 8 bytes.</p>\n<p>Sightglass/perf agrees with DHAT that instructions retired during compilation are improved by a statistically significant amount but with such a small effect size that it reports this PR is \"1.00x faster\" on the bz2, pulldown-cmark, and spidermonkey benchmarks.</p>\n<p>Sightglass' cpu-cycles measure and Hyperfine's wall-clock time both report that this PR is slightly slower when compiling Spidermonkey: the baseline version is \"1.00x to 1.01x faster\" according to Sightglass and \"1.00 Â± 0.02 times faster\" according to Hyperfine. On the smaller benchmarks (bz2 and pulldown-cmark), Sightglass found no significant difference in cpu-cycles.</p>\n<p>In short, this PR has almost no effect on performance by any measure.</p>\n</blockquote>",
