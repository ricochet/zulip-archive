The idea was that the intrinsic (defined in <a href=\"http://libcalls.rs\">libcalls.rs</a>) would take a <code>MemoryIndex</code> instead of a <code>DefinedMemoryIndex</code> (you'll need to update <code>func_environ.rs</code> to have everything pass the full index, not just the defined index).</p>\n<p>The API of the <code>instance.rs</code> functions can change to taking a <code>MemoryIndex</code> (note the lack of <code>Defined</code>) and the implementation of that would probably be to just inline the two intrinsic implementations that are present in <code>libcalls.rs</code>. We're effectively moving the \"if\" of whether it's imported or not from compile time to runtime (but the cost is thought to be quite small in these cases compared to the cost of the entire intrinsic).</p>\n<p>Checking whether an index is defined or not is quite cheap, it's simply a comparison against the number of imported items.</p>\n<p>FWIW I'm not around for a ton of mentor-ing on this, I'd recommend that you'd be prepared for code-diving yourself to figure things out. If not you may want to ask around to see if someone else is willing to help out.</p>\n</blockquote>",
