This is a relatively complicated instruction with lots of special<br>\ncases due to the simd proposal for wasm. Like x64, however, the special<br>\ncasing lends itself to ISLE quite well and the lowerings here in theory<br>\nare pretty straightforward.</p>\n<p>The main gotcha of this commit is that this encounters a unique<br>\nsituation which hasn't been encountered yet with other lowerings, namely<br>\nthe <code>Umlal32</code> instruction used in the implementation of <code>i64x2.mul</code> is<br>\nunique in the <code>VecRRRLongOp</code> class of instructions in that it both reads<br>\nand writes the destination register (<code>use_mod</code> instead of simply<br>\n<code>use_def</code>). This meant that I needed to add another helper in ISLe for<br>\ncreating a <code>vec_rrrr_long</code> instruction (despite this enum variant not<br>\nactually existing) which implicitly moves the first operand into the<br>\ndestination before issuing the actual <code>VecRRRLong</code> instruction.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
