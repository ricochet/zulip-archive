We want this eventually since wasm will eventually get stack switching, but we can probably support interrupting and stopping long-running wasm modules sooner.</p>\n<p>In addition to the translate loop header stuff, what we would need is a timer thread or something that sets a flag once a module has taken too long, and then the loop header (and function prologues!) would check that flag and do a custom interrupt trap if it is set.</p>\n</blockquote>",
