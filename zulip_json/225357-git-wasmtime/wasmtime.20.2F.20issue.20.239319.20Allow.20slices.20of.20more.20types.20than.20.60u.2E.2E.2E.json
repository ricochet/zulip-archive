It's currently possible to work around this by using the <code>GuestMemory::to_vec</code> method, which is appropriately parameterized, but it would be nice to read slices of types like <code>u32</code> without having to copy all the values back into the host.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>This change woudl result in a slight memory savings for cases where you don't need the entire vector to be present in host memory.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>We can certainly leave things as they are, as it's always possible to fall back on <code>GuestMemory::to_vec</code>.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
