I mean, add an <code>AArch64::Inst</code> case with whatever stuff we need, including the conditional move.  Then we're guaranteed that no CLIR or isel transformation can break it, and also that regalloc won't insert any reloads in between the branch and cmov.</p>\n<p>I suspect that's not feasible, because it would require a combined conditional-branch-and-cmov <code>Inst</code>, and branches are handled specially in the newBE.  So the next best option is implement this at the isel level, I guess.</p>\n</blockquote>",

On AArch64, this lowers to the same conditional move.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, unless I'm mistaken, on x86 (legacy backend) it seems that full support for <code>cmov</code> instructions is missing? E.g., there is no legalization for select -&gt; selectif, only <code>expand_select</code> that @bjorn3 pointed out (that always lowers to a CFG diamond); and in <code>.../x86/opcodes.rs</code>, there is only the opcode for <code>CMOV_OVERFLOW</code>. Perhaps I'm missing some interaction that results in full cmov support. However, for now, I have not added support for the Spectre-specific guard to the legacy x86 backend. Given our policy of putting any x86-specific efforts toward the new x86 backend, I think this should be OK; but if we feel differently, I can dig into this more and implement what is needed.</p>\n<p>Because of that, the flag must be <code>false</code> by default to avoid breaking the legacy x86 backend. IMHO, we should flip it once we transition. Until then, we can ensure that we set it for specific embeddings that we control, e.g. in SpiderMonkey. Thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Now the flag is on by default, and I managed to work out support for the legacy x86 backend as well -- by making our side-effecting-black-box-op <code>selectif_spectre_guard</code> rather than <code>select_spectre_guard</code>, we can just associate it with the same encoding as for <code>selectif</code> (except that no legalizations or optimizations understand the op so they will not alter it). I think this addresses all concerns above: on by default, works on all platforms, optimizations won't interfere. Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
