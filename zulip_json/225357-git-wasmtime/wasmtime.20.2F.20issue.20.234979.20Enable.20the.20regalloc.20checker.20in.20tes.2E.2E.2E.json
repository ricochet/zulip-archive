The reason is that regalloc errors tend to become more interesting as multiple instructions, or nontrivial control flow, interact. If we trivially miss an instruction input or output constraint, that will immediately cause tests to fail. But if, for example, we accidentally clobber some other register, we're more likely to see a failure if there is enough register pressure in the function that something else is also using that register.</p>\n<p>As well, enabling the checker for the main testsuites increases the critical path length for CI, while fuzzing is a separate workflow off to the side.</p>\n<p>So I suspect that \"turn it on sometimes for some compilation fuzz targets\" is our best option. I'm interested in what others think of this!</p>\n</blockquote>",
