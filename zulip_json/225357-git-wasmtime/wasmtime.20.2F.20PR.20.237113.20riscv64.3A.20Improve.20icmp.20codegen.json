This commit specifically targets the <code>icmp</code> Cranelift instruction<br>\nwhen producing a 0 or 1 value as a result. This is unlikely to be used<br>\nall that much in normal programs since most of the time a comparison is<br>\nfed into a branch for example.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless I was hoping to start simple and work my way out towards<br>\nbranches eventually. My hope is that by improving this codegen this can<br>\nbe extracted to helpers later on to assist branches and various other<br>\nlowerings.</p>\n<p>One part that this commit removes is various sign-extensions around<br>\n<code>icmp</code> because, at least according to RISC-V's ABI, values are always<br>\nsign extended when sitting at rest in their registers. I'm not sure if<br>\nCranelift respects this everywhere just yet, but it seems like a good<br>\nrule of thumb to follow and if it causes issues it may be best to track<br>\ndown other lowering rules to fix the problems.</p>\n<p>Additionally this does not update <code>icmp</code> for 128-bit integers just yet.<br>\nThis is only the comparisons necessary for register-size values or<br>\nsmaller.</p>\n</blockquote>",
