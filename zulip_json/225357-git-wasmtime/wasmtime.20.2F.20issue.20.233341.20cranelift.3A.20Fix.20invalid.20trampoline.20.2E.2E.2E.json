This would be an appropriate work-around for Bmask (but then we have #1429).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sorry, I just missed your comment before opening this!</p>\n<p>Just to reiterate, I know <code>raw_bitcast</code> is not the right answer. And agree that <code>bmask</code> would be a better solution</p>\n</blockquote>",
