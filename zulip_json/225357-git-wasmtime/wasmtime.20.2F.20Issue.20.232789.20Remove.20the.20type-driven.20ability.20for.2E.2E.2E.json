My understanding of the duplicate-imports discussion is that there are core-wasm use cases where linking based on the name identifiers alone isn't sufficient, however it also seems like core-wasm types and signatures also aren't sufficient for those use cases, because they're too low-level in general, so they'll need to do something else anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Currently <code>Linker</code> is sort of a weird hybrid of trying to do name-based resolution but also doing some amount of positional-based resolution. Instead though I think it should lean one of the two directions and not try to bridge the gap which in the limit seems un-bridge-able.</p>\n</blockquote>",
