This shouldn't change functionality at all, but seems nice for documentation purposes, as I initially assumed that there must be operations modifying the front of the stack given the use of <code>VecDeque</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
