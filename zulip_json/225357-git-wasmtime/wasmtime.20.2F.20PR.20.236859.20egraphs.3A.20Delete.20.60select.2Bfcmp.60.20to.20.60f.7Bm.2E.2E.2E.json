I discussed this this morning with @fitzgen and @sunfishcode and we talked about this issue in depth and concluded that this doesn't actually affect wasm (as @afonso360 initially concluded but sought confirmation of too).</p>\n<p>In investigating this though we reached the same conclusion as you @jameysharp which is that we could fix the rule by swapping the operands. We were, however, surprised by the definition of <code>f{min,max}_pseudo</code> in CLIF (which inherit their definitions from the simd proposal for wasm, which we found equally odd). Our conclusion was that we should probably just remove these rules for now and furthermore delete the <code>f{min,max}_pseudo</code> instructions in favor of their expanded forms using <code>select</code> and <code>fcmp</code>. The x86 backend could then pattern match the two instructions together to achieve the desired instructions on x86 (which appeared to be the original motivation for adding them to the spec anyway)</p>\n<p>So if you agree then that seems like the least-risky way to move forward, effectively removing the confusion around operand orderings of <code>f{min,max}_pseudo</code>, and instead having that subtelty only in the wasm-&gt;CLIF translation as well as the x86 backend.</p>\n</blockquote>",
