This is similar to <code>fail-fast: true</code> but that can't be used because the jobs aren't all part of the same matrix. The original goal for this was to save CI time on the merge queue where if something failed it should get out of the merge queue quickly instead of waiting for all other jobs to succeed and then report the one quick failure.</p>\n<p>This seems to run into an issue, though, where if a Windows builder fails then running cancellation will instead mark the Windows builder as cancelled instead of failed. This can be confusing for test failures because nothing looks obvious and each log needs to be manually pored over.</p>\n<p>To help address this the commit here disables auto-cancellation of the \"test\" matrix of jobs, re-enabling <code>fail-fast: true</code> at the same time. This way test if a test job fails it won't actually cancel everything else so everything else will run to completion, but given that tests are typically the longest part of the build that's hopefully ok.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
