If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n<p>This PR gives the <code>c-api</code> library a distinct name and adds <code>rlib</code> to the <code>crate-type</code> list, so that it can also be used from Rust. This is useful in situations like <a href=\"https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/1864\">https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/1864</a>, where a project (here tree-sitter) is mainly written in C and uses the wasmtime C library, but also provides Rust bindings. The easiest way to vendor the wasmtime C library for the tree-sitter C library during compilation of the tree-sitter Rust crate is then to simply depend on the <code>wasmtime-c-api</code> crate in the Rust bindings.</p>\n</blockquote>",
