So we have to use some flavor of the apple-aarch64<br>\nABI there.</p>\n<p>Since we want to support the wasmtime custom convention for multiple<br>\nreturns on apple-aarch64 too, a new custom Wasmtime calling convention<br>\nwas introduced to support this.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As a matter of fact, the wasmtime tests using many arguments were broken on trunk, when being run on my M1 machine. I'll look into ways to automate testing on our side, and share the results with a broader audience.</p>\n</blockquote>",
