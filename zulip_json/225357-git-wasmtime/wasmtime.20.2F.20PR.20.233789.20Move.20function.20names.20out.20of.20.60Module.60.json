Spurred on by #3787 to look at module load<br>\ntimes I noticed that a huge amount of time was spent in deserializing<br>\nthis map. The <code>spidermonkey.wasm</code> file, for example, has a 3MB name<br>\nsection which is a lot of unnecessary data to deserialize at module load<br>\ntime.</p>\n<p>The names of functions are now split out into their own dedicated<br>\nsection of the compiled artifact and metadata about them is stored in a<br>\nmore compact format at runtime by avoiding a <code>BTreeMap</code> and instead<br>\nusing a sorted array. Overall this improves deserialize times by up to<br>\n80% for modules with large name sections since the name section is no<br>\nlonger deserialized at load time and it's lazily paged in as names are<br>\nactually referenced.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
