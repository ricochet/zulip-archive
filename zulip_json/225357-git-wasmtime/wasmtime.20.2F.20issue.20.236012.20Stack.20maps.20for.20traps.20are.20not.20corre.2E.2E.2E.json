This is frequently done with <code>.take_stack_map()</code>, however, and some \"compound opcodes\", such as float-to-int conversion on x64, have many traps throughout their body. Only one trap will get the stack map when they theoretically all need the stack map.</p>\n<p>Additionally, though, Wasmtime doesn't actually need stack maps at trap opcodes since after a trap an instance will be terminated and all stack-based roots will become unrooted and candidates for GC. </p>\n<p>Given this I think it would be best to remove all stack maps from traps since they're otherwise just taking up space in the compiled artifact and aren't getting used for anything.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This is because in addition to the stackmap metadata itself, the safepoint-at-every-trap implies spilling all ref values to the stack. So code that (i) has refs and (ii) has other ops that trap, like divides or non-truncating float/int conversions, might see speedups.</p>\n</blockquote>",
