I've updated the comment. Now that we're using something like <code>psm</code> it's more official and less educated. Otherwise this just refers to the imprecision about accounting for wasm stacks. If you ask for wasm to have a megabyte of stack, we may end up giving it a megabyte plus or minus a few hundred bytes.</p>\n</blockquote>",
