Since that function is mutually recursive with <code>w_complex_object</code>, this corresponds to a C stack depth of about 4,000 frames, plus a few for setting up the test.

We can look into that a bit; however I think the high-order bit here, actually much more important, is to set expectations/norms around this sort of thing, so I'm going to go ahead and give some thoughts on that. (I don't mean to pick on this particular instance of the issue @brettcannon -- this is just a useful \"norm-setting opportunity\", so I'll make a general point.)</p>\n<p>In general, I want to make sure we don't (accidentally or otherwise) fall into a \"no regressions ever\" expectation. The size of a stackframe (number of spillslots) is implementation-defined, and a Wasm compiler is free to be as efficient or as inefficient as it likes. A test (such as the one linked above) that depends on the stack size fitting <em>just under</em> some implementation-defined limit, given implementation-defined stackframe sizes, is a really brittle test: it could break with any minor version update. In other words, I want to be very clear here first that Wasmtime/Cranelift are perfectly standards-compliant here, and so in a strict sense, this is not a bug. I would consider a \"blow up by factor of N\" regression a performance bug, but this is not that: it's one extra spillslot.</p>\n<p>Of course, all else being equal, regressions are bad. Over time the compiler should improve on average, and we would never want to take a change that adds an extra 16 bytes to a stackframe with no other benefit. But that qualification is key: most things have tradeoffs. (In the case here, 4-6% faster compile times, according to the commit message.) The impact of a strict no-regressions policy is that one ends up climbing the hill to a local maximum, and one can never really change the design otherwise: the core algorithms/approach are ossified forever (or a new algorithm/approach needs to go to absolutely heroic lengths to match or exceed the old approach in every single benchmark, and is always \"on call\" to be \"fixed\" when new cases are discovered).</p>\n<p>Investigations of small N% regressions like this one can be <em>useful</em> because they can uncover real problems, or opportunities to fix a case. I'll also defer to @jameysharp whether he wants to dig into this one. I wouldn't be surprised however if it ends up being something like \"values processed in slightly different order and spillslot-reuse heuristic now stops searching one step too soon\" -- that sort of thing can easily happen in a complex compiler.</p>\n<p>I'd second @alexcrichton 's suggestion to set either the recursion depth or stack limit to widen the gap between the two a bit -- in other words the most sustainable approach here is to not live right \"on the edge\" of the limit.</p>\n<p>I don't want to discourage filing bugs for this sort of thing, as long as they have enough detail to be helpful; but I just want to make sure we're all on the same page re: acceptable outcomes.

Personally I feel that this sequence of events for this issue is ok to play out, though.

In particular, Chris says regalloc2 does a value-merging pre-processing step that sounds to me like it should have made the input to register allocation be the same with or without the PR. Perhaps merging values earlier is enabling other Cranelift optimizations that lead to longer live-ranges?</p>\n<p>It would certainly be nice to understand the root cause here. But I think @alexcrichton's <code>--max-wasm-stack</code> option is the best solution for making this particular CPython test reliable.

The issue was opened more to make sure we had not found a bug as CPython is somewhat notorious in doing in edge cases of platforms. <span aria-label=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f601\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span> I will lower the stack depth cap in CPython under WASI to a lower number (which is the key purpose of the test; to know when we need a lower stack depth so that we can make sure you don't overflow and we can raise an exception instead).</p>\n</blockquote>",
