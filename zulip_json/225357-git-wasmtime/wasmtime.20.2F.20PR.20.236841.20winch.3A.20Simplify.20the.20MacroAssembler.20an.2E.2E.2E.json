Initially, I intended to include this change as part of the original change supporting floats, but that change is already sizable enough.</p>\n<p>This modification simplifies the Assembler and MacroAssembler interfaces, as well as the interaction and responsibilities between them, by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Eliminating the <code>Operand</code> abstraction, which didn't offer a substantial benefit over simply using the MacroAssembler's <code>RegImm</code> and <code>Address</code> abstractions as operands where necessary. This approach also reduces the number of conversions required prior to emission.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shifting the instruction dispatch responsibility solely to the MacroAssembler, rather than having this responsibility shared across both abstractions. This was always the original intention behind the MacroAssembler. As a result, function definitions at the Assembler layer become simpler.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This change also introduces richer type information for immediates, which results in better instruction selection in some cases, and it's also needed to support floats.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
