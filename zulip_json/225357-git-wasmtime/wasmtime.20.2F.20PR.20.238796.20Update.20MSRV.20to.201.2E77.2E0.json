This means that CI will now use the latest stable of 1.79.0 for testing primarily. Additionally this updates the pinned nightly commit used for testing to today's nightly and fixes a few warnings that uncovered. I plan on having a follow-up that leverages some new APIs and features in 1.77.0.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
