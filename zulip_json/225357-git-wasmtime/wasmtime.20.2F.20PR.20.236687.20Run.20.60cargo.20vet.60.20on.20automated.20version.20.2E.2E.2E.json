This updates the version bumping process to run <code>cargo vet</code> as part of the committed changes which hopefully will get everything to succeed. To ensure that the same version of <code>cargo vet</code> is used in both locations the installation procedure was extracted into its own separate little action.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
