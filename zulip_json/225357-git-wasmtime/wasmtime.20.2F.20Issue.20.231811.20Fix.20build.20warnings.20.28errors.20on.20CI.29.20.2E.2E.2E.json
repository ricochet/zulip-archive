Maybe a race condition of some sort? Or a hidden crash? Worth noting I'm testing with LLVM/LLDB 10.0, while the test instance seems to use version 9.0.</p>\n<p>In any case, would it make sense to disable the failing test (and create an issue) since it's on master already and is blocking other PRs?</p>\n</blockquote>",

The underlying issue seems to be the update to the lock file in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1805\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1805</a>, so it may also be best to roll back the updates there (except for our own version bumps) and see if that fixes the issue.
