Specifically, the system linker expects to see these two relocation in that order.</p>\n<p>However, the cranelift backend currently emits the relocations in reverse order - this unfortunately causes the linker to corrupt the instruction sequence when performing a TLS relaxation.</p>\n<p>To fix this in the backend, I need support in machinst common code to emit a relocation at some offset to the instruction about to be emitted (e.g. the relocation should target two bytes into the 6-byte instruction that will be emitted next).  I've added a new routine add_reloc_at_offset to that effect.  This also allowed to simplify some existing code in the backend.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
