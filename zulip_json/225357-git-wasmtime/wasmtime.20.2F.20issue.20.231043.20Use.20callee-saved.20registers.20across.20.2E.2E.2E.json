Knowing the end goal might help us understand better what to recommend. E.g., if you're trying to call a function that actually <em>does</em> conform to an ABI with no callee-saves, the right answer is \"add support for that different ABI\". If you want registers on the stack for... debugging, or observability, or something like that, then we can talk about that in more detail.</p>\n</blockquote>",
