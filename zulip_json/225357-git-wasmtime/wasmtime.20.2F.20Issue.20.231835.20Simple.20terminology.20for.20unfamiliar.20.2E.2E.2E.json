(and given those:)<br>\nWhat is Wasm-bindgen?<br>\nWhat does WASI add?</p>\n<p>So, i added a transition paragraph that touches on them and tries to tie them together for the next paragraph about Wasmtime.</p>\n<p>Again simple terms are used, to try to make it easier for the reader.  This understates the significance of the components.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If a definition is there, it shouldn't create confusion.</p>\n<p>BTW, I'm not expecting you'll necessarily use any  proposed words as is, and you all are welcome to excerpt or change anything I suggest as needed.  I'm a somewhat recent convert to rust, and I what I hope to suggest are clarity for new users who are bootstrapping themselves, from less background, which is where I am coming from.  It's challenging to write for two very different groups: new users and internals developers, not just for the desire for technical clarity, but conventions.  So this is understandable.</p>\n</blockquote>",
