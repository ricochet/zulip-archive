The motivations for this commit are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently looking up the exports of a component unconditionally requires string lookups at runtime. Unlike with core modules this can't be frontloaded to a pre-instantiation step. While not a huge amount of runtime it's a problem I've wanted to solve historically.</li>\n<li>Currently #8395 is unsolved and will require adding even more work to the export lookup path. This is something I've been hesitant to do without implement the previously mentioned optimization as it would slow down the instantiation process even more since now it'd do semver parsing and such.</li>\n<li>Eventually I'd like to be able to, at the API layer of Wasmtime, reason about the exports of pre-instantiated components to build up a graph of instantiations via <code>InstancePre</code> to enable components to call each other. That isn't done in this PR but this is intended to lay some groundwork for that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the process of solving these motivations I've redesigned how exports work on components. Previously a <code>Component</code> only had <code>component_type()</code> and an <code>Instance</code> has a \"walker\"-style API which could be used to walk through the exports of a component (performing string lookups along the way). All <code>Instance</code>-based infrastructure has now been removed and replaced with <code>ComponentExportIndex</code>. </p>\n<p>A <code>ComponentExportIndex</code> represents a preloaded pointer to an export, or where one will be. This can be acquired through <code>Component::export_index</code> which can be done during the compilation/loading process of a component. To handle the nested nature of component instance exports this function also takes an <code>Option&lt;&amp;ComponentExportIndex&gt;</code> representing the parent instance where <code>None</code> is the root of the component. This enables walking the entire exported API of a component with only this function and no need for a nested traversal with types.</p>\n<p>Additionally all <code>Instance::get_*</code> methods are generalized to take a new generic argument instead of just a <code>&amp;str</code>. If this argument is a string it's a convenience method to load from the root of the component, but otherwise a <code>ComponentExportIndex</code> can also be passed here. A new<code>Instance::get_export</code> method can be used to lookup <code>ComponentExportIndex</code> at runtime and traverse through the instance nesting as well (and also takes an <code>Option&lt;&amp;ComponentExportIndex&gt;</code> argument for the parent in the same way as <code>Component::export_index</code>).</p>\n<p>This all then leads to changes in the output of <code>bindgen!</code>. Namely I wanted to take advantage of these new features so the creation of bindgen-generated wrappers is now done with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>*Pre</code> structure is created from <code>InstancePre&lt;T&gt;</code> and wraps <code>InstancePre&lt;T&gt;</code> as well as each of the <code>ComponentExportIndex</code> values for all the internal functions.</li>\n<li>A <code>FooPre::instantiate</code> method exists to create a <code>Foo</code> where all functions are looked up via index.</li>\n<li>A <code>Foo::instantiate</code> convenience is still provided to do these two steps internally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The diff here is a bit scarier than the actual size of this PR due to the number of updates to the bindgen-generated output for the wit-bindgen tests. Otherwise though much of this PR is refactoring to handle all the above consequences.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The <code>str::lookup</code> function name here is the sugar-y form of <code>&lt;str as InstanceExportLookup&gt;::lookup</code> where we're explicitly selecting the impl on <code>str</code> so rustc knows ahead of time that the first argument must have type <code>&amp;str</code>. Given the <code>&amp;String</code> receiver it auto-derefs into <code>&amp;str</code>.</p>\n<p>(this only works as <code>str::lookup</code> isn't a method otherwise or on any other trait)</p>\n</blockquote>",
