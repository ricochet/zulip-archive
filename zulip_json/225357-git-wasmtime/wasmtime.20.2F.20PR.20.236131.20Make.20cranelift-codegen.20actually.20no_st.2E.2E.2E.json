The thread local issue could be worked around by using nightly thread locals implementation, which isn't std dependent if <code>std</code> feature not used. The missing <code>Instant</code> could be fixed by not having a default timer implementation for no-std / having a no-op one. Both can be fixed by having no-op timer functions under conditional compilation, but that doesn't sound like a particularly nice solution.</p>\n</blockquote>",
