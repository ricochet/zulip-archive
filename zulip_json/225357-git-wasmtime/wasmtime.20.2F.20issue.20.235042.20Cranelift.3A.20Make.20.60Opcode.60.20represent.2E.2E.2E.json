Totally sensible with that that, just wondering if we can expect any gains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is from that session a few of us had a couple weeks ago when profiling compilation. IIRC, there weren't any measurable speed ups but I wouldn't be surprised if there was something here that is just small enough that we'd have to really turn the iteration count up to see.</p>\n</blockquote>",
