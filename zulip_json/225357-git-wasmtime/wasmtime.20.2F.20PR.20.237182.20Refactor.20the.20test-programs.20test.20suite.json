Often writing tests requires complicated interactions with the guest which can't be done via hand-written <code>*.wat</code> syntax and requires a compiler to get engaged. For this purpose Wasmtime currently has the <code>crates/test-programs/*</code> test suite which builds files from source and then runs the tests. This has been somewhat cumbersome in the past though and it's not been easy to extend this over time, so this commit attempts to address this.</p>\n<p>The scheme implemented in this PR looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>All wasm test programs live in <code>crates/test-programs/src/bin/*.rs</code>. All of them, no exceptions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wasm tests have shared support located at <code>crates/test-programs/src/lib.rs</code> and its submodules, such as bindings generation for WASI.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wasm tests are built by a new <code>crates/test-programs/artifacts</code> crate. This crate compiles modules and additionally creates components for all test programs. The crate itself only records the path to these outputs and a small amount of testing support, but otherwise doesn't interact with <code>wasmtime</code>-the-crate itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All tests in <code>crates/test-programs/tests/*.rs</code> have moved. For example wasi-http tests now live at <code>crates/wasi-http/tests/*.rs</code>. Legacy tests of wasi-common now live at <code>crates/wasi-common/tests/*.rs</code>. Modern tests for preview2 live at <code>crates/wasi/tests/*.rs</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wasm tests are bucketed based on their filename prefix. For example <code>preview1_*</code> is tested in wasi-common and wasmtime-wasi. The <code>preview2_*</code> prefix is only tested with wasmtime-wasi, however.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new <code>cli_*</code> prefix is used to execute tests as part of <code>tests/all/main.rs</code>. This is a new submodule in <code>tests/all/cli_tests.rs</code> which executes these components on the command line. Many old \"command\" tests were migrated here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Helper macros are generated to assert that a test suite is run in its entirety. This way if a <code>preview1_*</code> test is added it's asserted to get added to both wasi-common and wasmtime-wasi in the various modes they run tests.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall this moved a number of tests around and refactored some edges of the tests, but this should not lose any tests (except one that wasn't actually testing anything). Additionally the hope is that it's much easier to add tests in the future. The process is to add a new file in <code>crates/test-programs/src/bin/*.rs</code> named appropriately. For example a preview2 executable is <code>preview2_*</code> and a CLI tests is <code>cli_*</code>. When building the test suite an error is generated in the appropriate module then of \"please write a test here\", and then a test is written in the same manner as the other tests in the module.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

The underlying issue was present before this PR but it's only exposed in this PR so I lumped th efix in here. The problem was that <code>clap</code>'s parsing of <code>PathBuf</code> requires the value to be non-empty and we were modeling all of the arguments to wasm as <code>Vec&lt;PathBuf&gt;</code>. I've switched to <code>Vec&lt;OsString&gt;</code> to enable passing through empty arguments.</p>\n</blockquote>",
