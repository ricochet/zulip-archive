The existing behavior remains unchanged; the pass's toplevel loop calls this extracted method.</p>\n<p>This refactor is a prerequisite for using the alias analysis as part of a refactored egraph-based optimization framework.</p>\n<p>(Unfortunately the git diff here doesn't pick up the code motion, but almost all of the body of <code>process_inst()</code> is unchanged, just moved.)</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
