This commit implements this strategy to ensure that fallback <code>shuffle</code> instructions, for example, don't generate a branch instruction to skip over immediates.</p>\n<p>Additionally in these commits is a refactoring of float/splat lowering in the aarch64 backend. Previously it was all living in Rust but to get to know it I translated it all to ISLE. I felt that the logic was a bit more understandable after the transition and more easily shows off what all the special cases are (the problem is more well-suited for ISLE I think than Rust, nothing against the prior code of course which was perfectly readable).</p>\n</blockquote>",
