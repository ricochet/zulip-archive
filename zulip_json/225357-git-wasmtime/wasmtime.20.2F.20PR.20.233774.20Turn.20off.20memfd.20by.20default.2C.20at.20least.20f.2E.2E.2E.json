This PR disables memfd by default; it can be enabled<br>\nby specifying the <code>memfd</code> feature for the <code>wasmtime</code> crate, or when<br>\nbuilding the commandline binary.</p>\n<p>We plan to explicitly add memfd-enabled fuzzing targets, let that go for<br>\na while, then probably re-enable memfd in the subsequent release if no<br>\nissues come up.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
