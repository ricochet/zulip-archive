As per the<br>\ndoc-comment, this should return <code>None</code>. Note that the <code>match</code> in<br>\n<code>branch_destination()</code> does have <code>IndirectJump</code> in the analogous place;<br>\nthis appears to just have been an oversight.</p>\n<p>Adding an LICM test from the fuzzer (minimized) because this is how it<br>\nwas triggered; it's somewhat difficult to write a more direct test than<br>\nthis.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
