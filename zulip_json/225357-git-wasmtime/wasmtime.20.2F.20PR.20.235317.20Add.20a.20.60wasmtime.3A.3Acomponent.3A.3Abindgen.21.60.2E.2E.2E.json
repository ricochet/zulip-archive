This is made possible by recent infrastructural work around movement of the dependencies involved here, and this is the final process of extracting the macro to this repository. This commit creates a <code>bindgen!</code> macro in the <code>wasmtime::component</code> submodule. which is the <code>wit_bindgen_host_wasmtime_rust::generate</code> macro, more-or-less.</p>\n<p>A new <code>crates/wit-bindgen</code> folder is created here with a <code>wasmtime-wit-bindgen</code> crate which is the current contents of the generation in the <code>wit-bindgen</code> repsitory. I opted to not merge the full history here since recent revisions by Pat have removed most of the historical support of lifting/lowering/async/etc so the history isn't really all that interesting. Additionally parts of the <code>wit-bindgen-core</code> and various other crates were merged in here and adapted to just work for this wasmtime generator.</p>\n<p>This is intended to be the \"final\" interface for how developers will work with <code>*.wit</code> files and Wasmtime. This <code>bindgen!</code> macro takes in a <code>*.wit</code> file and will, hopefully, forevermore be how this all works. This is all included in the <code>wasmtime</code> crate when the <code>component-model</code> feature is enabled. Further development of this macro is expected to happen in this repository, not externally. I'll in short order delete the sources in the <code>wit-bindgen</code> repository in favor of the sources here.</p>\n<p>Tests have been migrated here, mostly the <code>codegen</code> ones. Otherwise though the component model is already thoroughly tested so the <code>runtime/*/host.rs</code> tests were not migrated. A few small ones have been added to ensure that the generated structure works but otherwise testing is largely left to the already tested embedding API.</p>\n</blockquote>",
