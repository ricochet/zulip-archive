Also, underscores to separate digits (as<br>\nis allwoed in Rust) were not supported. Finally, 128-bit constants were<br>\nnot supported at all.</p>\n<p>This PR addresses all issues above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integer constants are internally stored as 128-bit values.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Parsing supports either signed (-2^127..2^127) or unsigned (0..2^128)<br>\n  range. Negation works independently of that, so one can write<br>\n<code>-0xffff..ffff</code> (128 bits wide, i.e., -(2^128-1)) to get a <code>1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Underscores are supported to separate groups of digits, so one can<br>\n  write <code>0xffff_ffff</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A minor oversight was fixed: hex constants can start with <code>0X</code><br>\n  (uppercase) as well as <code>0x</code>, for consistency with Rust and C.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This PR also adds a new kind of ISLE test that actually runs a driver<br>\nlinked to compiled ISLE code; we previously didn't have any such tests,<br>\nbut it is now quite useful to assert correct interpretation of constant<br>\nvalues.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
