For fuzzers that just throw random<br>\ndata at the wall and see what sticks, this means that they'll now be<br>\nable to throw simd-shaped data at the wall and have it stick. For<br>\nwasm-smith-based fuzzers this commit also updates wasm-smith to 0.6.0<br>\nwhich allows further configuring the <code>SwarmConfig</code> after generation,<br>\nnotably allowing <code>instantiate-swarm</code> to generate modules using simd<br>\nusing <code>wasm-smith</code>. This should much more reliably feed simd-related<br>\nthings into the fuzzers.</p>\n<p>Finally, this commit updates wasmtime to avoid usage of the general<br>\n<code>wasm_smith::Module</code> generator to instead use a Wasmtime-specific custom<br>\ndefault configuration which enables various features we have<br>\nimplemented.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
