We'd just push a new branch called <code>main</code>, switch via the GitHub UI this repo's default branch to the new branch, and then delete the old <code>master</code> branch.</p>\n<p>One issue though is how to deal with active PRs. Deletion of the <code>master</code> branch will auto-close all open PRs against it, and ideally we'd have them retarget the <code>main</code> branch instead of get auto-closed. (a magical github feature may make this much easier to manage)</p>\n<p>One other perhaps minor side issue to investigate is I'm not actually sure how Cargo deals with git dependencies that don't specify a branch but don't have the default branch as <code>master</code>. For example we may break:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">[dependencies]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">wasmtime</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">git</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">&#39;https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime&#39;</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I think it's fine to break that, but we'll want to detect that an probably open a Cargo issue to recognize a missing <code>branch = '..'</code> annotation as \"pick up the default branch from the remote\" rather than \"assume the branch is called <code>master</code>\"</p>\n</blockquote>",

Clearly they can make this go much more seamless, so <span aria-label=\"fingers crossed\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f91e\" role=\"img\" title=\"fingers crossed\">:fingers_crossed:</span> they do!
