I've tried to reproduce this cross-compiling to i686-pc-windows-gnu from Linux and hit build failures (as expected) in several places.  Nevertheless, while trying to discern what others may be attempting, I noticed some dead x86-32-specific code in our repo, and figured it would be a good idea to clean this up. Otherwise, it (i) sends some mixed messages -- \"hey look, this codebase does support x86-32\" -- and (ii) keeps untested code around, which is generally not great.</p>\n<p>This PR removes x86-32-specific cases in traphandlers and unwind code, and Cranelift's native feature detection. It adds helpful compile-error messages in a few cases. If we ever support x86-32 (contributors welcome! The big missing piece is Cranelift support; see #1980), these compile errors and git history should be enough to recover any knowledge we are now encoding in the source.</p>\n<p>I left the x86-32 support in <code>wasmtime-fiber</code> alone because that seems like a bit of a special case -- foundation library, separate from the rest of Wasmtime, with specific care to provide a (presumably working) full 32-bit version.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
