I think that everything should be in order now and there should be <code>FIXME</code> comments on major ticket items still remaining to do after this PR.</p>\n<p>I've opened this as a second PR to provide my assistance in pushing this over the finish line. Many of my comments were relatively minor or stuff I would want to do quickly in a follow-up to help future-proof things as well so I figured I'd go ahead and make the changes here. The vast majority of this work is still Luna's and Daniel's!</p>\n</blockquote>",
