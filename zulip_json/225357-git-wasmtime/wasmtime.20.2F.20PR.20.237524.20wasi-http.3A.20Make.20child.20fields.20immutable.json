All <code>fields</code> returned by getter methods on any of the request/response types are considered immutable, while <code>fields</code> that have been created directly through the use of the <code>fields</code> constructor are considered mutable until ownership is passed to an outgoing request or response.</p>\n<p>This change paves the way to runtime validation of the <code>Content-Length</code> header, ensuring that it's safe to check the value provided when an outgoing request or response is created.<br>\n&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
