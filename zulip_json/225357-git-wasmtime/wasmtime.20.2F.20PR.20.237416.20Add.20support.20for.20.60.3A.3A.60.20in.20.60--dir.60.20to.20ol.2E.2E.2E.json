In Wasmtime 14+ though this argument is being repurposed with an optional trailing <code>::GUEST</code> to configure the guest directory. This means that <code>--dir</code>-with-remapping behavior is actually unusable without the environment variable configuration from #7385 due to it parsing differently in the old and the new.</p>\n<p>This commit updates the situation by adding <code>::</code>-parsing to the old CLI meaning that both the old and the new parse this the same way. This will break any scripts that open host directories with two colons in their path, but that seems niche enough we can handle that later.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
