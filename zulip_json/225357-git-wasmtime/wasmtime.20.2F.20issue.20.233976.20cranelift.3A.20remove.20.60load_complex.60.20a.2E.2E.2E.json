He suggested we try removing these <code>*_complex</code> variants and I thought that seemed a good idea--less complexity! Please let me know if you have seen uses of these in the wild or if the rationale for their original inclusion is something other than the one I came up with in the description.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Given no known users, and complexity in handling the variadic arguments in pattern-matching, and the non-orthogonality (the operation can be expressed as <code>iadd</code>s to compute the address, then a simple <code>load</code>/<code>store</code>), it seems reasonable to make this refactor. But anyone please let us know if there is a good reason not to!</p>\n</blockquote>",
