That being said all we need is the offset/size of each symbol within the text section, so I think that's pretty reasonable to encode in <code>FunctionInfo</code>. I'll look to do that to avoid having to match up against symbol names, and I don't think that will take too long to decode when we load a module.</p>\n</blockquote>",
