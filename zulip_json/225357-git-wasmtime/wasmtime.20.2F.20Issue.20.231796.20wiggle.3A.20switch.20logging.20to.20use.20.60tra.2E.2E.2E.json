In the future, Nick plans to introduce <code>tracing_noop</code> crate in the cranelift tree so that spidermonkey doesn't have to vendor in the <code>tracing</code> ecosystem (they're particularly sensitive about vendoring deps, for good reason), and we can use that as a way to disable tracing in this crate once this lands. I don't think disabling it is worth blocking this change for now. </p>\n<p>The example program at <code>crates/wiggle/test-helpers/examples/tracing.rs</code> demonstrates the use of <code>tracing-subscriber</code> and <code>log</code> as backends to the tracing statements emitted by wiggle.
