I was thinking about working on this soon, because the work that Trevor and I have been doing on cleaning up tail calls has fixed some of the issues that would have made this even harder. But it's even cooler to see somebody else tackling this and I would love to see you continue.</p>\n<p>One thing I notice is that <code>cranelift/filetests/filetests/isa/x64/simd-lane-access-compile.clif</code> turns on SSSE3, so the case you're running into isn't represented in our compile tests. That would be good to fix.</p>\n<p>After deleting <code>has_ssse3 has_sse41</code> from that file and re-running the filetests with <code>CRANELIFT_TEST_BLESS=1</code>, I see that this call is a lib-call to <code>X86Pshufb</code>.</p>\n<p>That's not the only lib-call we may emit on x86; there are also functions implementing floating-point fused multiply-add (FmaF32/64) and various floating-point rounding modes (Ceil/Floor/Nearest/Trunc), for older CPUs without the corresponding instructions.</p>\n<p>So this isn't specifically a SIMD issue, and it doesn't apply to most SIMD instructions either. But I'm also not sure where the segfault you saw came from. Off hand, I don't know why omitting a frame pointer would cause a function call to segfault.

Then, most x86 code can actually tolerate 8-aligned stacks, but moving between MMX registers and memory generally requires 16-alignment, and indeed it looks like Rust/LLVM are producing <code>movdqa</code> instructions with 16-aligned offsets from the stack pointer in this particular libcall.</p>\n<p>So that explains why you'd only see problems with this specific call.

I don't remember exactly but libcalls should be similar.</p>\n<p>Note that if you're using <code>rust-analyzer</code> to navigate, there are some nearby parts of the call-graph that it can't find because they're in macros, so if you hit a point where things seem to be missing you might also want to try just searching for the function's name. Someday I hope to reduce our usage of macros…</p>\n<p>Those <code>*_args_size</code> fields are stored on the <code>Callee</code> until <code>Callee::compute_frame_layout</code> is called, and then they're forwarded to the backend's implementation of <code>ABIMachineSpec::compute_frame_layout</code>.</p>\n<p>There's another field on <code>Callee</code> that's also forwarded, <code>is_leaf</code>. Maybe the thing to do here is just set that to <code>false</code> if there's any kind of function call, including libcalls.</p>\n</blockquote>",
