Could you outline a bit the motivation for this change?</p>\n<p>Our intention is to sort of keep the <code>Caller</code> type \"hamstrung\" for now because we don't want it to exist long-term. For now it's the only way to implement WASI APIs, but the intention is that interface types will subsume the need for this API (and we'll remove it once that's implemented and stabilized). With interface types, however, you won't have much access to the calling module's functions, so I'd be wary to enable a pretty critical piece of functionality we're inevitably going to remove.</p>\n<p>In any case though I'm curious to hear more about  your use case, since we might still be able to cater to it one way or another!</p>\n</blockquote>",

It looks like y'all are primarily using this to lookup the calling module's <code>malloc</code> function, right? If that's the case then that's something which interface types will enable so this seems reasonable to allow.</p>\n<p>Could you also update the documentation though to leave the clause that it's only implemented for some types? Additionally can you add some words to the documentation that for functions it should in general follow the guidelines of the interface types proposal for accessing exports and calling them?</p>\n<p>Finally, one thing I wanted to point out, y'all will want to be extremely careful when accessing the caller's memory. The main idea is that once you get a raw pointer into wasm memory you can't call wasm again because that pointer could get relocated. In <a href=\"https://github.com/proxy-wasm/test-framework/pull/1\">https://github.com/proxy-wasm/test-framework/pull/1</a> the <code>proxy_get_buffer_bytes</code> export is an example where <code>malloc</code> is called while holding some pointers alive over the call to <code>malloc</code>. Where possible I'd recommend investigating <code>witx</code> and <code>wiggle</code> since they should make implementing all of these host calls with 100% safe code much easier.</p>\n</blockquote>",
