The two cases added here are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A <code>MemFdSlot</code> is now created with a specified initial size. For<br>\n  pooling this is 0 but for the on-demand case this can be non-zero.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When <code>instantiate</code> is called with no prior image and the sizes match<br>\n  (as will be the case for on-demand allocation) then <code>mprotect</code> is<br>\n  skipped entirely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the <code>clear_and_remain-ready</code> case the <code>mprotect</code> is skipped if the<br>\n  heap wasn't grown at all.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This should avoid ever using <code>mprotect</code> unnecessarily and makes the<br>\nranges we <code>mprotect</code> a bit smaller as well.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
