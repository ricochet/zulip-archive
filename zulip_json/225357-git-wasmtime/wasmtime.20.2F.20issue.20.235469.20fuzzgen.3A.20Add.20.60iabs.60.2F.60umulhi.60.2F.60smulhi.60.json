I'm not sure if we came to a solid conclusion.</p>\n<p>On one hand, they're kind of a pain to implement and we're not sure how useful they are. I guess these would be useful for bignums, but only if you're using 128-bit limbs, which is maybe a poor life choice on 64-bit targets.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, that's not a very strong argument for leaving a hole in the supported types, inconsistent with other instructions. We'd generally prefer to support all types on all operations where it's clear what the operation should do with that type.</p>\n<p>Personally, my preference would be that we should go ahead and implement I128 for consistency. But I also doubt that anyone is going to prioritize doing that work any time soon.</p>\n</blockquote>",
