Additionally the application may have its own sigaltstack handled somewhere else.</p>\n<p>I think we'll want to check the current sigaltstack here and if it's big enough just skip all this entirely, and then for flags I'm not really sure we need to check too much, but I don't think we should panic if the embedder has a particular configuration.</p>\n</blockquote>",
