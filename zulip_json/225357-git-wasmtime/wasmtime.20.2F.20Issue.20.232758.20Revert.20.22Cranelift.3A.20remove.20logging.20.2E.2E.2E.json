Or checks some other global that we control? That's definitely taking on a responsibility that should be covered by the logging infra but maybe we can make it safer...?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Random (cute) idea: how about we add a <code>log::debug</code> statement at the top of wasmtime cranelift's entry point so that it warns users that compilation may be slower at this log filter level? This way, only people who did set up the log level too high will see the message, and that's something they can try to address on their side.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, forcing users to not enable <code>log::debug</code> statements because it destroys performance in Cranelift is a bit of a sub-optimal developer experience.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If that's the case, this means that the macro arguments will be evaluated, before being passed to the <code>log::Log</code> implementation where they can end up being ignored by the caller (if it returned early).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the <code>log_enabled!</code> macro will check for the first two items, and then call into the <code>log::Log</code> implementation of <code>enabled</code>, which must return true if the logger's impl cares about this particular level (and log target).</p>\n<p>I don't have all the background for the <code>log</code> API design, but I wonder why all the macros don't check for <code>enabled</code> before evaluating the arguments (likely for performance reasons; that'd be an extra function call for every log message!). Overall, I think that if we'd actually take this PR, we'd force our users into setting the global log level (<code>log::max_level</code>) to any level <em>below</em> <code>Debug</code> (excluded) if they want to have the best performance. It would mean that our users have a binary choice between \"allow any logging of levels Debug and above (== Trace)\" versus \"get good performance from Cranelift compilation\". This actually sounds bad to me: one could care about getting <code>debug!</code> messages in some part of their application, while not caring about the <code>debug!</code> messages from Cranelift itself, and still wanting to get the best performance out of it. So it is unfortunate that we need to do this hack, but the current state without this PR allows both for 1. not blocking the maximum log level and 2. getting the maximum performance out of Cranelift. Hence I'd rather <em>not take it</em>.</p>\n<p>What do you all think about it?</p>\n<p>(Alternatives: make the vcode string rendering not so dramatically slow, use our own log macros that use <code>log_enabled</code> as suggested by @cfallin)</p>\n</blockquote>",

There's not a great way to do this all the time but the theory is that you can avoid speeding things up by deferring actual formatting to when requested. (e.g. have one-off structs with <code>Display</code> impls that \"do the thing\" internally, although probably more ergonomically than is the default).</p>\n<p>The separation was indeed for performance, where the <code>Logger::enabled</code> is expected to be called internally from <code>Logger::log</code>. The <code>Logger::log</code> method has the ability to also filter based on the message, e.g. \"only log strings with <code>foo</code> in them\". You're right, though, that the consequence of the current usage is that if debug is enabled anywhere then everything slows down in Cranelift since the argument evaluation is expensive.</p>\n</blockquote>",
