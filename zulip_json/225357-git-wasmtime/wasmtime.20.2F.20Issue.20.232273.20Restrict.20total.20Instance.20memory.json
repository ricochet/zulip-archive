I need to limit the maximum memory consumed by each running block to 5MB.  I looked through the docs and found no way to restrict how much memory the VM can allocate.  There seems to be a built-in limit of 4GB.  See #1872 .</p>\n<p>Let's support or document how to restrict total instance memory.</p>\n</blockquote>",
