Most of the<br>\nchanges here were already fixed in <code>wasmparser</code> with some tweaks to<br>\nesoteric modules, but Wasmtime also gets a bug fix where where import<br>\nmatching for the size of tables/memories is based on the current runtime<br>\nsize of the table/memory rather than the original type of the<br>\ntable/memory. This means that during type matching the actual value is<br>\nconsulted for its size rather than using the minimum size listed in its<br>\ntype.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
