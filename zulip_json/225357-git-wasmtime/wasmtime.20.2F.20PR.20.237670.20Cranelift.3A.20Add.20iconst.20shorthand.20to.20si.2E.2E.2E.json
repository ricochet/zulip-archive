I couldn't find a way to have what I guess would have to be sortof a \"parameterized extractor\" so that it can take one of its parameters as an input and the other as an output -- but it feels like that might fundamentally break the \"there are extractors and there are constructors\" model that it seems like ISLE depends on.</p>\n<p>Thus the only way I could figure out to make it work was the version where the extractor has the signature <code>fn(&amp;mut self, Value) -&gt; Option&lt;(Type, i64)&gt;</code> that you see here.</p>\n<p>So I'd love to not need the <code>self.ctx.func.dfg</code> stuff, but I couldn't figure out how.
