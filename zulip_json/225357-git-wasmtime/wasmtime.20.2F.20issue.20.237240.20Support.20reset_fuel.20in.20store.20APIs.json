This isn't necessarily a problem, nor do I think this is a blocker for this PR, but I think it indicates that we haven't done a great job of picking the right abstraction related to fuel. Or perhaps they're all independently motivated but given the ad-hoc nature of the additions I suspect we can do better. The fuel methods we have right now are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Store.html#method.fuel_consumed\"><code>fuel_consumed</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Store.html#method.fuel_remaining\"><code>fuel_remaining</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Store.html#method.add_fuel\"><code>add_fuel</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Store.html#method.consume_fuel\"><code>consume_fuel</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be clear this is mostly food-for-thought. I do not wish to block this PR, and if @fitzgen approves we should merge.</p>\n</blockquote>",
