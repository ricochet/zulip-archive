Prior to this PR imported<br>\nitems are accidentally also counted as defined items for sizing<br>\ncalculations meaning that when a memory is imported but not defined, for<br>\nexample, the <code>VMContext</code> will have a space for an inline<br>\n<code>VMMemoryDefinition</code> when it doesn't need to.</p>\n<p>Auditing where all this relates to it appears that the only issue from<br>\nthis mistake is that <code>VMContext</code> is a bit larger than it would otherwise<br>\nneed to be. Extra slots are uninitialized memory but nothing in Wasmtime<br>\never actually accesses the memory either, so it should be harmless to<br>\nhave extra space here. Nevertheless it seems better to shrink the size<br>\nas much as possible to avoid wasting space where we can.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
