In order to make the crate more agile for future changes to the way we do wiggle codegen for supporting multiple snapshots, this PR sets in place the design pattern that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>only the <code>handle</code>, <code>fd</code>, and <code>sched</code> modules get to import types from the wiggle codegen</li>\n<li>all other modules import the types they need from those modules</li>\n<li>drop the <code>types::</code> prefix everywhere we can</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We ignore this rule in <code>snapshots::wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> because we'll be making more changes to that soon.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
