While a fallback for <code>fcvt_from_uint</code> was implemented in #7919 I forgot to do the same for the signed version. This commit adds a fallback that decomposes the input into two scalars and converts each individually, then reassembling the result.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
