It's probably a relatively simple fix, but not a one-liner, and might need some more debugging or run into other issues later in the process. I need to context-switch away to some other things before leaving for two weeks; so this patch release will have to wait (sorry @bjorn3) -- since the known consumer of Cranelift that runs into the 8/16-bit issues can pin to an earlier version for now, I don't think it's security-issue-level urgent.</p>\n</blockquote>",
