Alternately, perhaps we should default to +inf (no deadline), as you suggest.</p>\n<p>I think the \"semantic etymology\" (if that's a thing) of this behavior probably traces back to fuel: by default one has no fuel, and one has to insert fuel to allow some execution. Here the default state is the same as the state after the thing has interrupted and returned to you once (deadline past, in either case); there's a nice symmetry to it. But that's certainly a subjective argument and not binding at all. I could go either way.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't think the \"trap immediately\" behavior is wanted by anyone either, but it's a more obvious bug to fix than never trapping.</p>\n</blockquote>",
