Seems that I could still compile with <code>cargo test --all</code> locally with these changes, let's see what CI thinks.</p>\n<p>One package is actually removed from the Cargo.lock file, which is surprising. Usually, the spurious dependencies exist because these are former dependencies of the package, but that have moved elsewhere. Removing these dependencies can sometimes help reorder the crate compilation graph, and slightly reduce overall build times on machines with multiple cores.</p>\n</blockquote>",
