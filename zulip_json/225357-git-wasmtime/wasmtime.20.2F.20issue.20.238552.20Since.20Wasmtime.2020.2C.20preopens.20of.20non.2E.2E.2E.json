And thanks @primoly for helping to track this down, I agree hat #8066 is what introduced this.</p>\n<p>Digging in a bit further it appears there's some subtle interactions which should have been bugs in wasmtime-py's bindings of 19-and-earlier. Currently wasmtime-py's <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py/blob/a0ef5ddd3fb6291ce8b527165326d4ab020c7232/wasmtime/_wasi.py#L144\"><code>preopen_dir</code> method</a> calls the <code>wasi_config_preopen_dir</code> function in the C API. Notably though the wasmtime-py bindings do not, and have not ever, checked the return value. The <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/96909c9755e8c91b3311280f2a95bf224456b020/crates/c-api/include/wasi.h#L167-L169\">function itself</a> returns a <code>bool</code> indicating a success or not.</p>\n<p>In Wasmtime 19 the function actually opened a directory and, on failure, returned <code>false</code>. The <code>wasmtime-py</code> bindings accidentally ignored this <code>false</code> value. In Wasmtime 20 the function no longer opens the directory, deferring the error to configuration creation time, where <code>wasmtime-py</code> does indeed check the error.</p>\n<p>This I believe gives the impression that Wasmtime 19 was allowing preopening nonexistent directories and failing on access. It was actually failing the whole time but wasmtime-py was accidentally ignoring it. In Wasmtime 20 the logic happened to move to a method where wasmtime-py was checking the return value.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So then we're left with a question of what's the best behavior here. First the wasmtime-py bindings should update to handle the return value of this function no matter what. In my opinion there should be an error returned somewhere during configuration here and we shouldn't commit to the prior behavior of basically ignoring preopen failures. The next question is then when to return the error, either when the preopen is configured or when the context is made.</p>\n<p>With <code>wasmtime::Config</code> we've opted to return errors from <code>Engine::new</code> where the <code>Config</code> is validated. This works out well I think because there's often interactions between configuration methods that aren't always obvious on each method in isolation. With that precedent I would lean towards deferring the error to when the wasi config is created as opposed to when the preopen is first registered.</p>\n</blockquote>",

My assumption so far has been that this is a question of when the drive is opened and where the failure is then propagated. The stack overflow question you linked to though seems to indicate that just the act of opening a nonexistent drive causes issues and the purpose of the question is to avoid the open entirely. In Wasmtime 19, though, I believe that the drive was opened in Rust and if you didn't see any adverse effects I'm not sure if that stack overflow question is applicable? Do you think though that Python is opening directories a bit differently than was done in cap-std to open a directory? </p>\n</blockquote>",

I only linked the SO question because the way it solves getting the list of logical drives (the thing I actually want) is by going through <code>ctypes.cdll.kernel32</code>, which is about as weird in Python as adding a direct <code>extern \"C\"</code> to kernel32 in your Rust code, basically. The equivalent of winapi-rs or windows-rs is unfortunately too heavyweight to depend on in YoWASP/runtime-py (I think it might require MSVC at install time).</p>\n<p>The errors people were getting there aren't really relevant for this use case, and the workaround itself is something I decided I'm just going to go ahead and ship after all. It's just kind of weird to do this? Not what you'd expect in idiomatic Python code, so I hesitated.</p>\n<p>In the general case of Wasmtime, I'd be worried about e.g. <code>os.access(path)</code> returning <code>True</code> but the preopen failing, in some edge cases, therefore creating not just more work for embedders but work that is very nontrivial to get done, or which gets neglected for the less-used Windows platform.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The workaround I have committed seems fine for my purposes; whenever I next bump wasmtime version I'll probably change it to use the new API, until then it lets me leave that version constraint relaxed.</p>\n</blockquote>",
