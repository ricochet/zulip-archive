Explicitly checks for null function pointers are no longer present and instead we let a segfault happen when loading from a null function pointer. This segfault is caught and the relevant instruction is annotated with the appropriate trap code.</p>\n<p>This support first starts by refactoring the <code>MemFlags</code> API to no longer purely be flags but instead be a mixture of flags and \"flag regions\". The <code>vmctx</code>/<code>heap</code>/<code>table</code> alias regions are bundled into two bits now and the various trap-related bits are now bundled into four bits. This enables putting arbitrary trap codes in a <code>MemFlags</code> so long as they aren't <code>TrapCode::User(_)</code>.</p>\n<p>Closes #5291 </p>\n</blockquote>",
