Because the reference is no longer live after the safepoint, the<br>\nsafepoint's stack map would not have an entry for the reference, which could<br>\nresult in the collector reclaiming an object too early, which is basically a<br>\nuse-after-free bug. Luckily, we sandbox the GC heap now, so such UAF bugs aren't<br>\nmemory unsafe, but they could potentially result in denial of service<br>\nattacks. Either way, we don't want those bugs!</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it is technically fine to dedupe bitcasts <em>to</em> reference<br>\ntypes. Doing so extends, rather than shortens, the live range of the GC<br>\nreference. This potentially adds it to more stack maps than it otherwise would<br>\nhave been in, which means it might unnecessarily survive a GC it otherwise<br>\nwouldn't have. But that is fine. Shrinking live ranges of GC references, and<br>\nremoving them from stack maps they otherwise should have been in, is the<br>\nproblematic transformation.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
