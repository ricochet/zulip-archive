This was inadequate for testing the <code>wasmtime-wasi-nn</code> crate. This change attempts to remedy that by (1) switching the \"check the environment\" logic of that script over to Rust and (2) writing some more tests. The tests all perform the same MobileNet inference but at different levels of abstraction; I would prefer to test other scenarios but this involves even more infrastructure and seems to be more the responsibility of the ML backend in question. At least this change makes it easier to test more ML backends as they are added and for developers to run tests directly with <code>cargo test</code>. Note that part of this infrastructure code is a way to skip tests when the environment is not ready for wasi-nn; developers should not see <code>cargo test</code> failures if they are not interested in the <code>wasmtime-wasi-nn</code> crate.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I need to be able to use the <code>test_check</code> module from various places: unit tests, integration tests, Wasmtime CLI tests... When I was trying to make this work I observed that I could <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> the <code>test_check</code> module and still use it for unit tests but not for the other cases. I actually need this logic available (somehow) in the public interface of the crate. Or perhaps not \"_the_ crate\" but rather \"_a_ crate\": I could move this logic to a separate crate like <code>wasmtime-wasi-nn-test</code> and create a <code>dev-dependency</code> on that?</p>\n</blockquote>",
