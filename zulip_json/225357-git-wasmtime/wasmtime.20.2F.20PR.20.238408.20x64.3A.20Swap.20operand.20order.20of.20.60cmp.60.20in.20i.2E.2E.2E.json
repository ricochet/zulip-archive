Upon reading over the instructions in <code>inst.isle</code> it appears that <code>x64_cmp</code> and its variants is the only remaining (after #8362) instruction where the operands are not in left-to-right form. The purpose of this PR is to refactor this situation to make sure all instructions have left-to-right argument orderings in their instruction helpers.</p>\n<p>This PR is broken down into a number of small commits. Each commit swaps just one method and then handles all callers of that method. By the end all callers of all <code>cmp</code> instructions should have their operand order swapped. Note that special care was taken in Winch where there were a few swaps-of-swaps. For example the <code>branch</code> helper previously had a variable called <code>lhs</code> which actually was the right-hand-side of a comparison. This caused no issues for code today as all operations were reflexive or with the same value, but I've documented and ensured that lhs is now indeed the left-hand-side.</p>\n<p>My intention as well is that <code>./ci/run-tests.sh</code> passes at each individual commit here as well. CI won't test that, but if anyone's interested to check it should work.</p>\n</blockquote>",
