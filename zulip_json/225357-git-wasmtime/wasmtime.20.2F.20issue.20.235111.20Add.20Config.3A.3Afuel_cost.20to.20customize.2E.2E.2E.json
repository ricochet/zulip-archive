Could you expand a bit more on the use case that you're envisioning for this? This is a pretty low-level degree of control to give from an embedding API around fuel and feels like a relatively large addition with the enum addition here (not that there's a better way to model this that I know of). I'm curious though if there's perhaps an alternative solution which doesn't expose such low-level control of the fuel costs, but there may not be.</p>\n<p>I would also be slightly concerned about the AOT-story here since in theory the costs all need to be equivalent, but that can also be \"patched\" by returning an error and disabling serialization if this <code>Config</code> field is configured.</p>\n</blockquote>",

From the documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In general, epoch-based interruption results in faster execution. This difference is sometimes significant: in some measurements, up to 2-3x. This is because epoch-based interruption does less work: it only watches for a global rarely-changing counter to increment, rather than keeping a local frequently-changing counter and comparing it to a deadline.</p>\n<p>Fuel, in contrast, should be used when deterministic yielding or trapping is needed. For example, if it is required that the same function call with the same starting state will always either complete or trap with an out-of-fuel error, deterministically, then fuel with a fixed bound should be used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
