If you statically know the function signature it's significantly more easy since you know what to transmute to and how to pass arguments, but a completely dynamic function signature will require a jit stub one way or another. For example in wasmtime if you use <code>Func::new</code> we have to create a jit stub which matches a known ABI (passing everything via pointers) to a dynamic ABI (the one specified at runtime via <code>Func::new</code>).</p>\n<p>If you want to support a small set of signatures you could probably create something like a hash set of shims and make it pretty easily with some macros/traits, but if you want to support \"given this list of string arguments from the CLI, parse them and call this jit function\" it'll be more involved b/c you'll need to jit a stub at that point.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Yeah, I think I understand what it would take to JIT-compile trampoline-like functions to implement the \"given this list of string arguments from the CLI, parse them and call this jit function\" idea.</p>\n<p>I think this PR still makes sense then as a precursor to that. @alexcrichton, how do you feel about reviewing this Cranelift stuff?</p>\n</blockquote>",
