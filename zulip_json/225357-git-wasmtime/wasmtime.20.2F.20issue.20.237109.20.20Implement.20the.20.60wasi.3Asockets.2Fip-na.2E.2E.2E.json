Which is understandable, but that doesn't quite reflect the proposal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>was the intention that implementations must avoid getaddrinfo?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, but to keep the WASI API surface area as small &amp; simple as possible, it isn't a drop-in replacement either. From the Readme:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Why not getaddrinfo?</h4>\n<p>The proposed <a href=\"http://./wasi-ip-name-lookup.wit\">wasi-ip-name-lookup</a> module focuses strictly on translating internet domain names to ip addresses and nothing else.</p>\n<p>Like BSD sockets, <code>getaddrinfo</code> is very generic and multipurpose by design. The proposed WASI API is <em>not</em>. This eliminates many of the other \"hats\" getaddrinfo has (and potential security holes), like:<br>\n- Mapping service names to port numbers (<code>\"https\"</code> -&gt; <code>443</code>)<br>\n- Mapping service names/ports to socket types (<code>\"https\"</code> -&gt; <code>SOCK_STREAM</code>)<br>\n- Network interface name translation (<code>%eth0</code> -&gt; <code>1</code>)<br>\n- IP address deserialization (<code>\"127.0.0.1\"</code> -&gt; <code>Ipv4Address(127, 0, 0, 1)</code>)<br>\n- IP address string canonicalization (<code>\"0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1\"</code> -&gt; <code>\"::1\"</code>)<br>\n- Constants lookup for <code>INADDR_ANY</code>, <code>INADDR_LOOPBACK</code>, <code>IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT</code> and <code>IN6ADDR_LOOPBACK_INIT</code>.</p>\n<p>Many of these functionalities can be shimmed in the libc implementation. Though some require future WASI additions. An example is network interface name translation. That requires a future <code>if_nametoindex</code>-like syscall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(...)

I saw the note about getaddrinfo yeah but I wasn't sure whether it was intended that a particular flag was passed or whether parsing was going to be required. I think your branch works well though, and I'll integrate that here, thanks for it!</p>\n<p>Also sounds good on access restrictions for now, I like the <code>GrantingAccess.md</code> link and agree that it's probably best to start off with a simple boolean for now and it can be bikeshedded/expanded later.</p>\n</blockquote>",
