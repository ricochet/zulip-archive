While theoretically useful I've elected to remove them here in favor of only the borrow-returning operations. They can be added back in in the future though if necessary.</p>\n<p>I've split the preexisting operations <code>isub_borrow</code> and <code>iadd_carry</code> additionally into signed/unsigned portions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>isub_borrow</code> =&gt; <code>usub_borrow</code> and <code>ssub_borrow</code></li>\n<li><code>iadd_carry</code> =&gt; <code>uadd_carry</code> and <code>sadd_carry</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This reflects how the condition needs to differ on the carry flag computation for signed/unsigned inputs. I've additionally fixed the interpreter's implementation of <code>IsubBorrow</code> when switching to the signed/unsigned opcodes.</p>\n<p>Finally the documentation for these instructions now explicitly say that the incoming carry/borrow is zero-or-nonzero even though it's typed as <code>i8</code>. Additionally the tests have been refactored to make use of multi-return which may not have existed when they were first written.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I was mostly copying LLVM how it's got <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/797f01198e8b41982916ba02d703bd6a96b5347e/llvm/include/llvm/CodeGen/ISDOpcodes.h#L289-L321\"><code>{S,U}{SUB,ADD}O_CARRY</code> opcodes</a> and I assumed there was a reason why.</p>\n<p>As for the actual semantics I can perhaps clarify that the addition/subtraction here is still 2's complement and is implemented the exact same way whether it's signed or unsigned. For example <code>*add_carry</code> both implement <code>a + b + (c != 0)</code> for the first result. The difference of signed/unsigned is the second result (whether or not the computation overflowed) and the computation for that is different whether if it's signed or unsigned. For example <code>0x7f + 0x01 + 0x00</code> always produces <code>0x80</code> but <code>uadd_carry</code> returns \"no overflow\" while <code>sadd_carry</code> returns \"yes overflow\".</p>\n<p>I'm not actually sure what signed overflow is used for in practice. I just added it because it felt symmetrical. I also wasn't sure of the condition of overflow for <code>iadd_cin</code> from before because it wasn't clear from the docs whether it was signed or unsigned overflow that was tested for the output.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The size of the patches I was carrying locally was getting a bit large so I wanted to upstream some of the smaller bits. In a branch I've got lowerings of these opcodes for aarch64 and x64, but they're very inefficient lowerings. I'm not certain I'll upstream the lowerings because I'm not sure it's worth it, but I figured that in the meantime it might be worth at least straightening out the CLIF side of things.</p>\n</blockquote>",
