That would boil down to a few components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/eefa286b0fa2c7abe7addbbc5a59e6ad158ce55b/crates/wasi-nn/src/wit.rs#L117-L120\"><code>add_to_linker</code> function</a> </li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/eefa286b0fa2c7abe7addbbc5a59e6ad158ce55b/crates/wasi-nn/src/wit.rs#L39-L55\">\"view structure\"</a> which provides contextual access to anything necessary, such as the configuration keys.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/eefa286b0fa2c7abe7addbbc5a59e6ad158ce55b/crates/wasi-nn/src/wit.rs#L25-L37\">context type</a> and builder if necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That would then all get integrated into the CLI in the same manner as wasi-nn where it's off-by-default but a flag can be passed to enable it.</p>\n<p>Does that sound reasonable to you?</p>\n</blockquote>",
