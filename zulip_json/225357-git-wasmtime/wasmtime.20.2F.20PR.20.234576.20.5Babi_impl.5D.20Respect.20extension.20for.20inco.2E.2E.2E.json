This causes a problem with<br>\nstack arguments on big-endian systems, since the argument address<br>\npoints to the word on the stack as extended by the caller, but the<br>\ngenerated code only loads the inner type from the address, causing<br>\nit to receive an incorrect value.  (This happens to work on little-<br>\nendian systems.)</p>\n<p>Fixed by loading extended arguments as full words.</p>\n<p>FYI  @cfallin </p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
