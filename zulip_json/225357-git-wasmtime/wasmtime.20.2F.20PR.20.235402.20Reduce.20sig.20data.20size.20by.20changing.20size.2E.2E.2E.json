With how widely the backends use <code>i64</code> I was afraid we'd have to sort out a lot of questions about which values actually should be signed. For example, are the various offsets in <code>StackAMode</code> allowed to be negative?</p>\n<p>Maybe changing <code>compute_arg_locs</code> triggers fewer difficult questions, though.</p>\n</blockquote>",
