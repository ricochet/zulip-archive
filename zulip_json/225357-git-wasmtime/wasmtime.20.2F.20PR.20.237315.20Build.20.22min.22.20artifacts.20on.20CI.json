Additionally all the<br>\nstops are pulled in terms of build flags, nightly versions, etc, to get<br>\na build that is as small as possible without actual source code changes.<br>\nThis effectively codifies the instructions in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7282\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7282</a> into an easily<br>\ndownloadable artifact.</p>\n<p>No new tarballs are created for github releases but instead tarballs<br>\nthat previously had a <code>wasmtime</code> executable for example now have a<br>\n<code>wasmtime-min</code> executable. Furthermore the C API which previously had<br>\n<code>libwasmtime.so</code> for example now has <code>libwasmtime-min.so</code>. The intention<br>\nis that the minimum-size artifacts are handy for determining a rough<br>\nsize of Wasmtime but they're not so important that it seems worthwhile<br>\nto dedicate entire release entries for.</p>\n<p>CI is refactored to support these minimum builds with separate builders.<br>\nThis means that a single tarball produced as a final result is actually<br>\ntwo separate tarballs merged together, one for the normal build we do<br>\ntoday plus a new \"min\" tarball produced on the new \"min\" builders.<br>\nVarious scripts and CI organization has been adjusted accordingly.</p>\n<p>While here I went ahead and enabled <code>panic=abort</code> and debuginfo<br>\nstripping in our current release artifacts. While this doesn't affect a<br>\nwhole lot it's less to upload to GitHub Actions all the time.</p>\n</blockquote>",
