While looking through the source I noticed there was a typo in a couple of error messages. This PR simply updates the error message strings. Since it was the same typo in two places we could extract a common string, but I wanted to keep this diff as small as possible. I don't think we need a new test case for this, but if you'd like one I can look into it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
