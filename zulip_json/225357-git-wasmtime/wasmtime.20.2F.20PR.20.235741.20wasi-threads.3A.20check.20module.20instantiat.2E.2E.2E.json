Basically the fallibility of spawning a thread I don't think is handled well. For example the OS could fail to spawn a thread, an embedder may want to limit threads, allocating resources for an <code>Instance</code> may fail (e.g. local linear memories if any). There's a lot of failure modes beyond \"the imports didn't line up\" so it's possible to trigger this <code>unwrap()</code> I think (although hard for the \"CLI world\").</p>\n<p>Basically I think that the wasi-threads proposal needs a way for an embedder to communicate a thread spawn failure and I think that the failure here needs to be communicated back somehow. That has its own set of thorny questions though because how \"blocking\" is the thread-spawn intrinsic? E.g. we ideally don't want to instantiate the instance on the caller thread ,but in the child thread like this. That means though that failure would be delayed since the thread may not start for a bit. Anyway I'm rambling now. Fine for now, but I think needs more work on the proposal.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This error should be communicated back to the WebAssembly guest; it isn't always a runtime failure. The <code>wasi-threads</code> proposal currently designates negative numbers as error codes so I think what could be done here is specify some of that range to match some of the possible reasons for failure here. How can I get the full list of possible errors that could be unwrapped here?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Not necessarily all of those should be communicated through an error code perhaps. For example maybe failure to instantiate is considered a fatal error that aborts all threads, but perhaps failure to spawn a thread at the OS level is communicated back to the thread-spawn caller. </p>\n<p>In any case, though, I think the upstream proposal should have a rough set of guidelines for what to do in these failure situations and how embedders communicate this to wasm.</p>\n</blockquote>",
