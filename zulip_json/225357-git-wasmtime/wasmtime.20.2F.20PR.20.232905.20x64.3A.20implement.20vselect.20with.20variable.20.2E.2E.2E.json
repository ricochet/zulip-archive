This is better than <code>bitselect</code> in general, which lowers to 4-5 instructions. The old backend had the <code>vselect</code> lowering; this simply introduces it to the new backend. </p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

That's less bad than clobbering but still bad, and would be somewhat hard to debug.</p>\n<p>In theory, dead defs <em>shouldn't</em> happen at the CLIF level, because we lower based on demand, though it's possible at the VCode level depending on the lowering pattern. There's also the issue that we use dead defs as a way to encode clobbers (at calls, for example), so we'd need a different category for those, but it could be doable.</p>\n<p>We can think more about this -- I'll add the disallow-dead-defs idea to my running list of \"things to look at next time I focus on fuzzing infra\" :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",
