I _suspect_ that it is indeed possible for the debugger to use <code>.eh_frame</code> alone, though the two sections are a little different in format details as well as usage (<code>.eh_frame</code> is like <code>.pdata</code> on Windows in that it is \"mandatory\").</p>\n<p>FWIW, there are much larger (pun intended) size problems with <code>-g</code>-produced object files at the moment. For one, all the location lists for variables with are very fragmented, it would help a lot if they could always refer to the one and only stack location, at least for unoptimized code.</p>\n</blockquote>",
