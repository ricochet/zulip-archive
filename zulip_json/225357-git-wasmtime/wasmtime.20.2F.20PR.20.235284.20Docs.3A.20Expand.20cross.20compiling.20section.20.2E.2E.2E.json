Could we keep the note about that, or at least note above that the <code>runner</code> commandlines can be used to run the cross-architecture binary directly if desired? (Also on that note, I notice the <code>cargo build ...</code> example is gone -- it's useful to indicate that one can do that as well, and the path where the cross-architecture binary ends up)</p>\n</blockquote>",
