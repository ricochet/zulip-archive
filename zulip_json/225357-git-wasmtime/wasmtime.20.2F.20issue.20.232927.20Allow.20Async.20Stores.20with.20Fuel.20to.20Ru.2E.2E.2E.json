The original intention was that <code>u32::max_value()</code> would be sufficient for anyone wanting to use this, although thinking about this again now if only a small amount of fuel is injected each time then we should perhaps bump that up to <code>u64</code>. I think that would allow effectively infinite execution still?</p>\n<p>Personally I think that this, if still desired instead of <code>u64</code>, should probably be done through a separate method which is dedicated to infinite execution instead of <code>None</code> silently representing that.</p>\n</blockquote>",
