Currently they're allowed to come afterwards, but instead all arguments and flags coming after a module will be interpreted as arguments for the module itself.</p>\n<p>This feature has a bit of a storied history at this point, and the breadcrumbs are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Originally landed in #6737</li>\n<li>Reverted for 12.0.0 in #6830</li>\n<li>Reverted for 13.0.0 in #6944</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This PR is intended to be landed as a sibling of #6925, another independent overhaul of Wasmtime's own options on the CLI, for the Wasmtime 14.0.0 release. More information about the motivation for this change, as well as consequences of the fallout, can be found on #6737.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
