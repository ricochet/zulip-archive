This is not practical, given the encoding space we have available. We are already matching expected \"null FOO reference\" trap messages when running the spec tests to our own \"null reference\" messages, so we can do that for <code>i31</code>s as well.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
