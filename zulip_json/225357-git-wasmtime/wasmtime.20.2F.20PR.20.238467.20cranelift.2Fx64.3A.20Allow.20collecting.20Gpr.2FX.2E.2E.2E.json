But the x86-64 backend uses newtype wrappers around Reg to ensure that different register classes don't get mixed up, so it had to convert types everywhere to pass registers to the operand collector.</p>\n<p>This commit allows the operand collector to accept any type which implements <code>Into&lt;Reg&gt;</code> instead. The newtype wrappers already implemented that, so we can mostly just delete the <code>to_reg</code> and <code>to_writable_reg</code> calls.</p>\n<p>However, those calls were also automatically dereferencing borrows as needed, so to minimize the need for explicit dereferences I've also introduced implementations for converting from &amp;Gpr/&amp;Xmm to Reg. That doesn't help with the Writable-wrapped registers but it's good enough. I have a PR in progress which will clean it up the rest of the way.</p>\n</blockquote>",
