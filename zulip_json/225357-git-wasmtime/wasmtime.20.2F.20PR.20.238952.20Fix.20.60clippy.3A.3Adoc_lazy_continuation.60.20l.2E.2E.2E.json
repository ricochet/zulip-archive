These warnings showed up due to a <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8958\">misconfiguration issue</a>. If you'd like though selectively adding lints to that <code>[workspace.lints.clippy]</code> block is something that's reasonable to do on a one-off basis. For example adding this lint to that block sounds like a good idea, although I think it will need to wait a bit because this lint was added in Rust 1.80 and we're using 1.79 in CI.</p>\n</blockquote>",
