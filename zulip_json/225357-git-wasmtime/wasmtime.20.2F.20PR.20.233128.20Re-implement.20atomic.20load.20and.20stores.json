The lowering from wasm to<br>\ncranelift sometimes introduced an uxtend but, it seems, all the<br>\nbackends were generating the uextend with their loads for the<br>\nsmaller data types and, I think, conversely for the stores.</p>\n<p>The AArch64 support was a bit broken and was using Armv7 style<br>\nbarriers, which aren't required with Armv8 acquire-release<br>\nload/stores.</p>\n<p>The fallback CAS loops and RMW, for AArch64, have also been updated<br>\nto use acquire-release, exclusive, instructions which, again, remove<br>\nthe need for barriers. The CAS loop has also been further optimised<br>\nby using the extending form of the cmp instruction.</p>\n<p>Copyright (c) 2021, Arm Limited.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

It originally seems to have been a big enough downside that no backend was pattern matching and instead just made assumptions about how atomic load was used, which isn't great! But if not separate instructions, is there a way that we can attach some form of extension/truncation attribute on the load and store instructions? This could be a nice way of refactoring all the memory operations.</p>\n</blockquote>",

So the lowering framework keeps track of reference counts for values; instructions are lowered in a backward pass where inputs are only produced if something depends on them, or if they have side-effects. However in this case the load is considered to have a side effect (it can trap). This actually needs slightly different handling; it's not legal to duplicate the load (imagine if e.g. a store interleaved).</p>\n<p>In cases where we merge an effectful op (like a load), we need to call <code>sink_inst()</code> on the context as well; see <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/d551997657c64ef77e6860f44241ed306787a6df/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/lower.rs#L121-L125\">this comment</a>.
