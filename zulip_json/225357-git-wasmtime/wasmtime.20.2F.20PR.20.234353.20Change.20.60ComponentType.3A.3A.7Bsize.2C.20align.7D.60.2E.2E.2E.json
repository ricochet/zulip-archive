Currently I'm predicting that adding memory64 support<br>\nwill probably double the surface area of each trait (e.g. <code>lower32</code> and<br>\n<code>lower64</code>) rather than have a parameter passed around. This is in the<br>\nhopes that having specialized 32 and 64-bit paths will enable better<br>\noptimizations within each path instead of having to check all bounds<br>\neverywhere.</p>\n<p>Additionally one day I'd like to have <code>fn load(bytes: &amp;[u8;\nSelf::SIZE32])</code> but that doesn't work today in Rust.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
