Note that this is similar to the logic of <code>AsyncReadStream</code> somewhat but that type is not appropriate in this context due to the singleton nature of stdin meaning that the per-stream helper task and per-stream buffer of <code>AsyncReadStream</code> are not appropriate.</p>\n<p>Closees #6986</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
