I really like the patch you have passing around <code>&amp;Mmap</code> to various locations. That feels like a great design not only from a safety point of view but also the portability point of view too. In terms of what's the best road to take here at least from our side we can help out with reviews and design feedback but the implementation will be up to you/others for sending PRs/handling feedback/tests/etc. I personally would love to see this fixed without waiting for illumos kernel changes.</p>\n<p>For a bit of history all our VM apis are a bit of a mish mash of organically evolved \"abstractions\" over time. The abstractions keep changing because we keep not being able to pin down exactly what we want. In that sense you're more than welcome to apply refactorings to shuffle things around (e.g. having one decommit instead of 3) and don't place too much weight on the current design.</p>\n<p>What I might recommend for landing these changes if you're up for it is incremental progress towards the refactoring here. The memory-related bits are notoriously tricky in Wasmtime so we ideally prefer to change only small bits at a time to ensure thorough review and everything. In that sense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps the first change could be to thread around <code>&amp;Mmap</code> in more locations. That would remove the need for a bunch of raw pointers in places and VM operations would be \"obviously based on an existing mmap\" by construction.</li>\n<li>Next VM operations could be pushed onto methods of <code>Mmap</code> which could include things like bounds checks assertions to ensure it's all in-range.</li>\n<li>Next we could have an illumos-specific implementation of <code>Mmap</code> which does the <code>/dev/null</code> truck as you've implemented with trees too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those could all be separate PRs, but separate commits in the same PR is something I'd personally be ok with too. (would primarily prefer to not lump it all into one though). And if you feel there's better divisions of commits/PRs definitely feel free to slice/dice further too.</p>\n<p>How's that all sound?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Any difficult parts I  or others can help out with during review too. </p>\n<p>One thing I think is ok is to store <code>Arc&lt;Mmap&gt;</code> in more places.
