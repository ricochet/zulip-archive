However, I didn't move the assertions from the <code>set</code> to the <code>with</code> methods, meaning that there was now a path that would avoid them. This follow-up fixes that mistake by moving the assertions into the <code>with</code> functions.<br>\n&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
