This went against the intent of the feature, to be a way for local developers to observe the generated source. As such, it ran afoul of some safety checks for that purpose, and also polluted users' Cargo caches in a way that we cannot now fix except in future releases.</p>\n<p>The best we can do is probably to take away features that are liable to be misused. Following discussion in today's Cranelift weekly meeting, we decided to provide this functionality under an environment variable instead. This allows folks who know what they're doing to get the same behavior, but does not expose a feature to crate users.</p>\n<p>Fixes #9625.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
