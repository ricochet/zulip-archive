Originally <code>wiggle</code> had a full-blown runtime borrow checker which verified that borrows were disjoint when appropriate. In #8277 this was removed in favor of a more coarse \"either all shared or all mutable\" guarantee. It turns out that this exactly matches what the Rust type system guarantees at compile time as well.</p>\n<p>This commit removes all runtime borrow checking in favor of compile-time borrow checking instead. This means that there is no longer the possibility of a runtime error arising from borrowing errors. Current bindings in Wasmtime needed no restructuring to work with this new API.</p>\n<p>The source of the refactors here are all in the <code>wiggle</code> crate. Changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>GuestPtr</code> type lost its type parameter. Additionally it only contains a <code>u32</code> pointer now instead.</li>\n<li>The <code>GuestMemory</code> trait is replaced with a simple <code>enum</code> of possibilities.</li>\n<li>Helper methods on <code>GuestPtr</code> are all moved to <code>GuestMemory</code>.</li>\n<li>A number of abstractions were simplified now that borrow checking is no longer necessary.</li>\n<li>Generated trait methods now all take <code>&amp;mut GuestMemory&lt;'_&gt;</code> as an argument.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes were then propagated to the <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> and <code>wasi-common</code> crates in their preview0 and preview1 implementations of WASI. All changes are just general refactors, no functional change is intended here.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
