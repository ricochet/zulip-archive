This has advantages such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the bench-api signatures explicitly indicate what is required for running a benchmark (e.g. working directory, where to capture stdout, what wasi modules are enabled, etc.)</li>\n<li>we will avoid thrash on the bench-api signatures and confine this type of configuration change to the configuration <code>struct</code> (still an API change, but not as drastic)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One additional thought is to version the configuration <code>struct</code> in some way (first field is a <code>usize</code>?) to verify that both sightglass and the bench-api shared library are operating on the same understanding of how to configure the benchmark.</p>\n</blockquote>",
