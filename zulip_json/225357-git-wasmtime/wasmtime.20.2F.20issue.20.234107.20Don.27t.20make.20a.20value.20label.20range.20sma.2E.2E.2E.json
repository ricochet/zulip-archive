Given that the code has been replaced in the latest <code>main</code>, the logic is slightly nontrivial (hence the fix carries some risk itself -- though I have no reason to believe it's incorrect, I also haven't looked at this code in a long time), and a new release with this code removed (0.37) should exist in ~10 days, I think on balance this probably not worth a point release. The impact is to debuginfo but not to the correctness of the generated code itself so this is not a potential security issue either.</p>\n<p>(For maximal clarity and to try to establish some precedent for later, if the code <em>did</em> still exist in <code>main</code>, then we would take this as a fix and backport to a new point release, I think; the difference in that case is that it continues to be exposed to normal use and fuzzing on <code>main</code> so the risk of issues in a unique side-branch is relatively smaller.)</p>\n<p>@bnjbvr does that sound reasonable? If not, happy to talk more :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",
