You can answer the questions below if they're relevant and<br>\ndelete this text before submitting. Thanks for opening an issue!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>What is the feature or code improvement you would like to do in Cranelift?<br>\nAfter merging <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1169\">bytecodealliance/cranelift#1169</a> (and seeing <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/1168\">bytecodealliance/cranelift#1168</a>), it occurred to me that we should output clippy warnings as a part of <code>test-all.sh</code>. I'm not sure we should fail the build (though this could be an option) but this would make non-clippy-approved additions more visible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the value of adding this in Cranelift?<br>\nIt should result in cleaner, more standard code in the long run.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>\n  algorithms to use?<br>\nAdd <code>cargo clippy</code> to <code>test-all.sh</code> and ensure <code>clippy</code> is installed for Azure pipelines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they better<br>\n  or worse than your proposal?<br>\nNo.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
