I'm hoping we can give it a spin on the first release, and if things go wrong we can always run the command manually. I suspect it'll take a release or two to get the invocations precisely correct.</p>\n<p>Before merging this we'll need to configure two separate secrets in CI. One is a GitHub personal access token and one is a <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> publication token. My plan here is to create a <code>wasmtime-publish</code> (or similar) bot account which we'll have tokens for and will be part of the <code>wasmtime-publish</code> team on <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>. Once this PR gets approved I'll work on making that bot account.</p>\n</blockquote>",

New crates should get published via that bot account and the personal access token is installed to allow it to push  to the repo and make PRs and such. </p>\n<p>I think that means that this is all set and ready to go, so I'm going to merge. We can talk about a new version this Thursday and give this release process a spin (not 1.0, just the next version)</p>\n</blockquote>",
