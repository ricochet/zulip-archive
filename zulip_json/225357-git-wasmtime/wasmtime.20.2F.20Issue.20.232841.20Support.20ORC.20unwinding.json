This format has somewhat recently been introduced as alternative to frame pointer based unwindingvfor use in the linux kernel.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>ORC is much simpler than DWARF unwind tables. This allows for a simpler and more robust unwinder. Wasmtime could for example use it for unwinding through wasn code as alternative to libunwind.</p>\n</blockquote>",
