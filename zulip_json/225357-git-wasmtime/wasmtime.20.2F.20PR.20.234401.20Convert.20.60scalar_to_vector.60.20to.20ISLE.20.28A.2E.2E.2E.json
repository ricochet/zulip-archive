Could the <code>multi_lane _ _</code> matcher here be replaced with <code>$I32X4</code> perhaps to avoid that? Reading over the previous lowering it looks like only <code>I32X4</code> and <code>I64X2</code> are supported so it may make sense to only list those two so if other types are ever used in the future an error pops out during lowering rather than the wrong lowering be used and waiting until runtime to have the error.</p>\n</blockquote>",
