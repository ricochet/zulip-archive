As far as I understood it, we decided we wouldn't add any more exemptions past the initial set that we had when we adopted cargo-vet, so this might need a true audit rather than an expanded exemption. (But I don't claim to fully understand our policies and cargo-vet subtleties here, so others please feel free to chime in too...)</p>\n</blockquote>",
