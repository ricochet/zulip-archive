I guess you can argue that the backend should be responsible for applying relocations on its own, and nobody seems to (currently) do anything with stackmaps anyway (at least in the context of <code>cranelift-module</code>)?</p>\n<p>In the absence of strong feelings, I am inclined to leave the patch as-is.</p>\n</blockquote>",

There's a reasonable argument that whatever design we pick for traps, we should use for stack maps as well, for the sake of consistency. Passing in a sink for traps and stackmaps gives the consumer more control than returning a vector, so I'm in favor of that design, if we're going to revise.</p>\n<p>I'm also ok with landing this as-is and revising it later, speaking as a downstream. Its not a huge difference to us either way, so I'll defer to bjorn and philipc.</p>\n</blockquote>",
