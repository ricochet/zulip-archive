Recently I've found that its stable as a VM on macOS. I personally find it easy to use for testing and it gives me another platform to test against which has exposed otherwise-unseen bugs.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>Trap handlers need to be updated and there are tests involving return values that usually fail.</p>\n</blockquote>",
