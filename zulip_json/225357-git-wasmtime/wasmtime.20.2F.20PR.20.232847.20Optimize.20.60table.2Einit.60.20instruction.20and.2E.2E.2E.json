One part of this commit is to remove some preexisting<br>\nduplication between instance instantiation and the <code>table.init</code><br>\ninstruction itself, after this the actual implementation of <code>table.init</code><br>\nis optimized to effectively have fewer bounds checks in fewer places and<br>\nhave a much tighter loop for instantiation.</p>\n<p>A big fallout from this change is that memory/table initializer offsets<br>\nare now stored as <code>u32</code> instead of <code>usize</code> to remove a few casts in a<br>\nfew places. This ended up requiring moving some overflow checks that<br>\nhappened in parsing to later in code itself because otherwise the wrong<br>\nspec test errors are emitted during testing. I've tried to trace where<br>\nthese can possibly overflow but I think that I managed to get<br>\neverything.</p>\n<p>In a local synthetic test where an empty module with a single 80,000<br>\nelement initializer this improves total instantiation time by 4x (562us<br>\n=&gt; 141us)</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

The main slowdown is that <code>vmctx_anyfunc</code> performed a multiplication instruction with the size of a pointer, where both the size and the index were not constant, resulting in bad codegen. By using the native types here it makes pointer arithmetic much speedier since everything is known at compile time.</p>\n<p>Once I removed one main use of the function in the table initialization bits I figured I might as well go ahead and remove the function and speed up other callsites as well.</p>\n<p>I do agree it's a bit more open coded, but then again everything about <code>VMContext</code> feels sort of inherently open-coded</p>\n</blockquote>",

We don't actually have anything to <code>memcpy</code> though because our element segments are stored as lists of function indices, but the tables themselves are <code>*mut VMCallerCheckedAnyfunc</code>. This means that there's a bit of a mismatch where unless we allocate table segments per-instance to <code>memcpy</code> from (which I dont think we should do) then there's actually nothing to memcpy. </p>\n<p>Otherwise, though, I just used <code>set_raw</code> here to be the same as the other bits and pieces of this module</p>\n</blockquote>",
