Several caveats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I chose to not replace all of the <code>ctx.emit(PXOR...)</code> uses with <code>ctx.emit_constant([0; 16]...)</code> because I was concerned there might be an extra allocation or extra logic that might slightly slow down compile times; if you don't think this is the case and want a consistent way of generating constants, I can do the replacement here</li>\n<li>I have not dug into removing <code>LowerCtx::get_constant</code> (its uses can all be replaced by <code>LowerCtx::get_immediate</code>) and the <code>LowerInput::constant</code> field--I can do that as a part of this PR but wanted to get feedback on the current changes first </li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
