By CPU cycles my measurements turned out noisier than I'd like, but report 1-5% faster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So this change is a marginal compile-time performance improvement at all sizes of our benchmark programs. All I was really concerned about is that it's not worse, so this result is great!</p>\n</blockquote>",
