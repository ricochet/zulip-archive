I can either add another cheat, er, \"config\" to the tests to ignore the readback. If the windows filesystem behaves like these flags request, we can add cfg(windows) code to wasi-common that stores these flags alongside the File so they are available for readback. That option is more complex, and I don't know whether it is worth it right now.</p>\n</blockquote>",
