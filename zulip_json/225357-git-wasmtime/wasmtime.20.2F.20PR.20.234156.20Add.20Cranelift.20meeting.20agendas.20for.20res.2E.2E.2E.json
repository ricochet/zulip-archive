This does mean we<br>\nsometimes have meetings in contiguous weeks, but given the number of<br>\ntopics we usually have to discuss, erring on the side of more discussion<br>\ntime (rather than just canceling) is probably not a bad thing.</p>\n<p>For the rest of this calendar year, given an otherwise regular<br>\nbiweekly-on-Mondays cadence, the holiday conflicts I am aware of are: US<br>\nMemorial Day (falls on Mon May 28, pushed meeting to Mon Jun 6); US<br>\nLabor Day (falls on Mon Sept 5, pushed to Mon Sept 12). If there are any<br>\nother holidays in the below dates, I'm happy to update further!</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
