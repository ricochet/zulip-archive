I've additionally added component support for the <code>wasi-nn</code> feature by adding it to the component linker when a component is loaded on the CLI. I've left <code>wasi-http</code> as not-enabled, however, since I'm not familiar enough with what its current status is.</p>\n<p>I think this should be ready to go though if you can give it another review @pchickey </p>\n</blockquote>",
