And the implementation of <code>into_iter()</code> on <code>&amp;Vec</code> is the same as calling <code>iter()</code> (they both return references to the elements of the vector) so you can use the shorter name. When I was playing with this locally I found that those two changes meant this part of the expression would fit on one line with <code>cargo fmt</code>s defaults. :grin: </p>\n<p>This is not remotely important, so I'm merging without that change and please don't bother writing another PR for it. This version is just fine as-is. But I thought I'd note the alternative.</p>\n</blockquote>",
