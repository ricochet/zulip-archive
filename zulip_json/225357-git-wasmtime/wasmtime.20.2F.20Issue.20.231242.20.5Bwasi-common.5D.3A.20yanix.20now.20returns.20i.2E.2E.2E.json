And I think we can it one step further too. Yanix started with a fair amount of <code>EOVERFLOW</code> checking, which is a good default stance in wasi-common because we convert a lot of host values into wasm32 values, however Yanix has now established itself as a library that just provides host functionality, without any wasm32-specific type conversions. So I went through this PR, and convinced myself that every single <code>EOVERFLOW</code> is either unneeded or we can do something else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hooray! Let me make adjustments then!</p>\n</blockquote>",
