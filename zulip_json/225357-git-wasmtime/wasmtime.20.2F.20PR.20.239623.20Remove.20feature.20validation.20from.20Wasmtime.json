Instead it's probably best nowadays to throw configuration at <code>wasmparser</code> and use its definition of features to determine whether constructs make sense or not. This reduces the amount of bits and pieces Wasmtime has to do and avoids interactions such as #9622.</p>\n<p>Closes #9622</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
