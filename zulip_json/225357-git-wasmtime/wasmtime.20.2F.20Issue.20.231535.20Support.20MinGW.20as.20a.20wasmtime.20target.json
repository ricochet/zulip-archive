I don't think it's clear how motivated this is right now (I don't know how often it'd be wanted on Go for Windows). I suspect this would be relatively difficult because of stack unwinding, but I might give this a go later today and see if it \"trivially works\" or \"trivially doesn't work\". Basically I think it's probably worth a little bit of effort to see how much effort it would take for us to support this.</p>\n</blockquote>",
