Tracing has a couple of advantages over <code>log</code> that make it well suited here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The concept of spans, which are natural to use in wiggle-generated functions where we want to log the arguments of a function, then later when an inner func returns we want to log the return values. the argument values and return value s are part of the same span, which means the backend can automatically correlate them, rather than have to associate them by searching on some common part of the text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(stable) support for structured fields (in log this is noted as unstable and called kv support), which also naturally matches to the names of arguments / return values we already have in witx, and keeps that structure around longer so that it can be e.g. encoded in json by the backend that sends it to some logging endpoint that understands json</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>tracing statements that are disabled (marked as uninteresting, essentially) by the backend are very low overhead - its one atomic load to determine whether a hook is disabled.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so. The list of<br>\n  suggested reviewers on the right can help you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please ensure all communication adheres to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">code of\nconduct</a>.<br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
