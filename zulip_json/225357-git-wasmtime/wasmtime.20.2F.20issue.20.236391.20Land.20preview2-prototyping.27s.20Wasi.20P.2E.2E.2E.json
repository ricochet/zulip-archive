There are a number of known deficiencies with the new implementation but we decided its time to move to this and iterate here. The new implementation won't replace the old one until we have resolved all of those problems, and it passes all of the same tests.</p>\n<p>The comment in <code>file_dir_sync.rs</code> is a @sunfishcode question - I don't actually know what that means.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think we can uncomment those two lines.</p>\n<p>Windows doesn't have a way to do a sync on a directory handle. Originally, WASI's impl would fail on Windows because we'd try to call the Windows API for files and it would fail when passed a directory handle. Now, we handle this so that it silently does nothing, which is the direction I think WASI as a whole is heading. The semantics for <code>sync</code> are \"do whatever <code>sync</code> means in the underlying fs\", and on Windows, that means do nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>",
