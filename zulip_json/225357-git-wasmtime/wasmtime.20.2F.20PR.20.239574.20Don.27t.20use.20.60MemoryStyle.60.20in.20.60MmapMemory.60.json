This should semanatically be the same as before but it's hoped that the new version is clearer to understand as it doesn't require going through the <code>MemoryStyle</code> abstraction to understand how tunables interact with linear memory. The semantics for the allocation of linear memory are:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>reservation = tunables.memory_reservation\ngrowth = tunables.memory_reservation_for_growth\nif maximum &lt;= reservation {\n    growth = 0\n} else if minimum &lt;= reservation {\n    // use settings above\n} else {\n    reservation = minimum + growth\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This means that the initial memory allocation is always <code>tunables.memory_reservation</code> unless that's not large enough to fit the linear memory. In such a situation the other settings, such as <code>memory_reservation_for_growth</code>, kick in.</p>\n<p>The logic of clamping the maximum and/or dealing with static/dynamic are now all unnecessary and/or tracked elsewhere. For example the clamping nature of <code>maximum</code> now happens implicitly by rejecting growth when <code>memory_may_move</code> is false which should help keep that complexity localized where necessary rather than conflating multiple settings together.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
