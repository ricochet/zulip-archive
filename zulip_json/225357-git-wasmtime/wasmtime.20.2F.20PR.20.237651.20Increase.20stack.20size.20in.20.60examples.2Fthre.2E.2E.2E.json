I can reproduce the failure locally and it appears to be due to the fact that macOS is giving spawned threads via <code>pthread_create</code> a 512K stack by default. Cranelift when compiled in debug mode is taking more stack than this (but working in release mode). I was talking with Trevor and Jamey about possible ways to reduce the stack size here but for now I'm going with Jamey's suggestion of increasing the stack size as the best course of action for now.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
