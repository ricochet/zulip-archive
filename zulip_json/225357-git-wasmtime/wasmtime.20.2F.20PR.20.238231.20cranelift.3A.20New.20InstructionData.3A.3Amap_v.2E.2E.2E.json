Therefore it's possible to use other fields in the callback as long as the compiler can see all the fields being used in the same scope. That's good enough for everywhere we were using this pattern, so we can simplify this way.</p>\n<p>The case which motivated this change isn't shown here: It isn't possible to call <code>dfg.map_inst_values</code> on every instruction in <code>dfg.insts</code>, because the borrow on <code>dfg.insts</code> prevents taking a mutable borrow on <code>dfg</code>. But we can call this new helper in that case.</p>\n</blockquote>",
