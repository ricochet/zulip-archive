This is because the definition of the<br>\nInstructionData enum in clif.isle does not match the actual type used<br>\nin Rust code.</p>\n<p>Specifically, clif.isle erroneously omits the ValueList variable-length<br>\nargument entry if the format does not use a typevar operand.  This is<br>\nthe case for Jump and a few other formats.  The problem is caused by<br>\na bug in the gen_isle routine in meta/src/gen_inst.rs.</p>\n<p>CC @cfallin @fitzgen </p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
