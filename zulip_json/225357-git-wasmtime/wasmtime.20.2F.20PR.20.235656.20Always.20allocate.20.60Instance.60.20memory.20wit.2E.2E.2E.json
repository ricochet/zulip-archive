This means that the allocation of <code>Instance</code> (and <code>VMContext</code>) memory, now always happens through the system <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> instead of optionally being part of the pooling instance allocator. Along the way this refactors the <code>InstanceAllocator</code> trait so the pooling and on-demand allocators can share more structure with this new property of the implementation.</p>\n<p>The main rationale for this commit is to reduce the RSS of long-lived programs which allocate instances with the pooling instance allocator and aren't using the \"next available\" allocation strategy. In this situation the memory for an instance is never decommitted until the end of the program, meaning that eventually all instance slots will become occupied and resident. This has the effect of Wasmtime slowly eating more and more memory over time as each slot gets an instance allocated. By switching to the system allocator this should reduce the current RSS workload from O(used slots) to O(active slots), which is more in line with expectations.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
