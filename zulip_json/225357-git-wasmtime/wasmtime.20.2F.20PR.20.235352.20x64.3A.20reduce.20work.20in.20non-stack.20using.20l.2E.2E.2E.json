This improvement was not made for x64 due to some<br>\ntest failures. This change avoids any frame setup for non-stack-using<br>\nleaf functions in x64.</p>\n<p>Because this updates the generated code, there are multiple sets of tests<br>\nto update -- each of these is separated here into its own commit. I will follow<br>\nup in the comments with benchmark results.</p>\n</blockquote>",
