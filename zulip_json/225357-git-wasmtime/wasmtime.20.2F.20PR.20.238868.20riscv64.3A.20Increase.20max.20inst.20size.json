It is also a follow up to #8850, in that PR I forgot to add some of the fields into the frame layout which end up having a codegen effect for the return call instruction.</p>\n<p>I've updated these fields with a somewhat real but worse case scenario. This ends up generating a lot of instructions though.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't think there's a good way to split return-call sequences into multiple pseudoinsts though. Definitely don't want to go back to a two-pass \"compute the size first\" mechanism, that will pessimize the common case. Hmm...</p>\n</blockquote>",

That way the <code>ReturnCall</code> instruction itself could calculate the size it needs, perform custom island-checking logic, and otherwise the maximum size of an instruction could go back to being significantly smaller (e.g. 5 or so instructions)</p>\n</blockquote>",
