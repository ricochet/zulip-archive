This brings in the CI proposed by <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6757\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6757</a> and then gets it passing locally by updating our <code>clap</code> and our <code>system-interface</code> dependencies. Note that <code>Cargo.lock</code> is not changing here which is intentional because the goal is to have the lower bound of the dependency be what's in <code>Cargo.lock</code> which is what we're testing against.</p>\n<p>Also note that the actual modifications to dependency requirements is not needed on <code>main</code> due to other PRs that update dependencies. As such the dependency version requirements here are only required for the release branch.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
