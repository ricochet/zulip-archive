Running some fuzzers<br>\nlocally though this instantly hit a lot of problems on AArch64 because<br>\nthe arbitrary padding isn't aligned to 4 bytes like all other functions<br>\nare. To fix this issue appending functions now correctly aligns the<br>\noutput as appropriate for the platform. The alignment argument for<br>\nappending was switched to <code>None</code> where <code>None</code> means \"use the platform<br>\ndefault\" and otherwise and explicit alignment can be specified for<br>\ninserting other data (like arbitrary padding or Windows unwind tables).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
