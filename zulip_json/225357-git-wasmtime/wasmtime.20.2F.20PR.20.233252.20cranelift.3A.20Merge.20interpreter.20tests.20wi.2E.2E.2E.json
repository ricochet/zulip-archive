The distinction<br>\nbetween interpreter tests and runtests is no longer very clear, since they should both support the same clif code, and produce the same results.</p>\n<p>We only have two test files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>add.clif</code> tests the add and jump instruction, both of which are already covered in other test files, so we remove that file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>fibonacci.clif</code> does a recursive call which is currently not supported in the filetest environment, so we keep this test interpreter only for now.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
