To make this acceptably<br>\nfast, we cut down dependencies of the ISLE compiler, so the \"fancy\"<br>\nerror printing is now optional. When not included, it just prints error<br>\nmessages to stderr in a list. However, this did not include file<br>\nlocations. It might be nice to have this without enabling the \"fancy<br>\nprinting\" and waiting for that to build.</p>\n<p>Fortunately most of the plumbing for this was already present (we had it<br>\nat one point before switching to miette). This PR adds back locations to<br>\nthe basic error output. It now looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">Error</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">building</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ISLE</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">files</span>: <span class=\"nc\">ISLE</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">errors</span>:\n\n  <span class=\"nc\">src</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">isa</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">aarch64</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">inst</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isle</span>:<span class=\"mi\">1</span>:<span class=\"mi\">1</span>: <span class=\"nc\">parse</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">error</span>: <span class=\"nc\">Unexpected</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">token</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Symbol</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"asdf\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
