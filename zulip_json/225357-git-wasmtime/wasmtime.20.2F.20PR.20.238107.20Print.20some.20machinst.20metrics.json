For instance, by compiling SpiderMonkey with this patch, we get these metrics out:</p>\n<p>Key(<a href=\"http://machinst.buffer.data\">machinst.buffer.data</a>): 0.0: 4 0.5: 412.0315874877959 0.9: 1636.1480687972453 1.0: 110084<br>\nKey(machinst.buffer.relocs): 0.0: 0 0.5: 1.9999056357269998 0.9: 9.999149133010329 1.0: 600<br>\nKey(machinst.buffer.traps): 0.0: 0 0.5: 11.999920242205052 0.9: 57.00277828432678 1.0: 3833<br>\nKey(machinst.buffer.call_sites): 0.0: 0 0.5: 1.9999056357269998 0.9: 9.999149133010329 1.0: 600</p>\n<p>Which suggest that the fields in MachBuffer struct could be reduced:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Half of the functions are under 412 bytes; most are under 1.6kB.</li>\n<li>Half of the functions have 2 relocs; most have at most 10.</li>\n<li>Half of the functions have 12 traps; most have at most 57.  The default allocation of 16 is probably OK for this field.</li>\n<li>Half of the functions have 2 call sites; most have at most 10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, there's only one MachBuffer per thread compiling code, so the savings here are marginal, but this approach could be used in other parts of the code to find more useful things.</p>\n<p>The output formatting at this point is pretty crude as this is merely a proof-of-concept, but something better can be made later if necessary.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
