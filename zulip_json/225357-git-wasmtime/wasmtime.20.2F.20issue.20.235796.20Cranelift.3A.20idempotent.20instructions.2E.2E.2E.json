That choice was valid when we processed only pure operators, which \"float\" outside of control flow and so have no need to limit their visibility to dominated blocks. But in the above program, the GVN map gets an entry when we see <code>v3</code> in <code>block1</code>, then we visit <code>block2</code>, see the GVN-map entry, rewrite <code>v4</code> to <code>v3</code>, and remove the second <code>udiv</code>. Elaboration will then place copies of the udiv back in <code>block3</code> and <code>block4</code> as the value is used, because it already exists in the layout elsewhere. So we never use a value outside of its defined range (i.e., defs still dominate uses), but we <em>do</em> lose information about where the def occurs.</p>\n<p>@jameysharp and I were at first thinking we could add a scoped hashmap to <em>not</em> dedup <code>v3</code> and <code>v4</code> to the same value, but actually this is suboptimal: the whole point of interning nodes in the egraph is to share the work of optimizing them once. And an idempotent op <em>is</em> mostly like a fully pure op, so we should be able to mostly reason about it in this shared way, <em>except</em> for where its side effects must have been made visible.</p>\n<p>A key insight for a better solution is: one can see any idempotent op as an <em>actual pure op</em>, with <em>two</em> outputs, the original and a \"has trapped\" flag; combined with an actual side-effecting op on the \"has trapped\" flag. We don't want to actually rewrite in this form. But in principle, the side-effect is separable in that way, and that gives us the GVN semantics that we desire.</p>\n<p>The proposal is this: let idempotent ops GVN as pure ops do. Unconditionally remove them from the side-effect skeleton (the <code>Layout</code>). But in their place in the <code>Layout</code>, insert a <code>force</code> pseudo-inst that uses the GVN'd value.
