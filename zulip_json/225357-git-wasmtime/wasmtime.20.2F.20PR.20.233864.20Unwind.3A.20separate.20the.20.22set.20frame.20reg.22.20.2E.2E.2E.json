In particular, if the stack check fails, then we<br>\nstart the process of backtracing from a state where we have actually<br>\nupdated rbp (the frame pointer) but we have not emitted the metadata<br>\nsaying we have done so.</p>\n<p>The fix is to emit the <code>SetFPReg</code> Win32 unwind op exactly at the offset<br>\nof the <code>mov rbp, rsp</code> instruction, not after the stack check. However,<br>\nactually achieving this output given our current unwind design (which<br>\nabstracts over SysV and Win32) is slightly tricky, because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We previously had a single <code>DefineNewFrame</code> op that both indicated<br>\n  where the FP was set, and gave the size of the clobbers;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don't know the size of the clobbers until we generate the<br>\n  clobber-save sequence; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The clobber-save sequence is generated after any explicit stack check.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To resolve the problem, this PR splits the <code>DefineNewFrame</code> op into two<br>\npieces: <code>SetFrameReg</code> and <code>DefineNewFrame</code>. On x86-64 and aarch64 this<br>\nis emitted in the appropriate place. (<code>s390x</code> does not use a frame<br>\nregister, so has no need for this op.) This should resolve the issue we<br>\nwere seeing with Windows-2022 and unwinding.</p>\n<p>(Thanks to @alexcrichton, @iximeow and @peterhuene for help debugging<br>\nthis!)</p>\n<p>I've switched the main Windows CI jobs back to Windows-2022 (naming this explicitly rather than <code>windows-latest</code> to pin our CI on a known version -- happy to switch that to <code>-latest</code> though if we think that's better). I've also added a job that explicitly tests Windows-2019 to ensure we don't have any other regressions. If the overhead for this is too high then maybe we can remove it after seeing a clean pass at least on this fix.</p>\n<p>Fixes #3859.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
