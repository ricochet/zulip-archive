There is now an issue for adding alignment support back in (#6716) which might benefit from looking at this issue but I don't think this old issue needs further discussion.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In particular, make it clear that the alignment can depend on the target ISA and OS.</li>\n<li>Implement an optional alignment field on <code>StackSlotData</code>.</li>\n<li>Implement the alignment inference algorithm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The alignment inference algorithm needs to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The function's incoming stack pointer alignment guarantees. If any stack slots are more aligned than the incoming stack pointer, dynamic stack realignment is required. We want to avoid that.</li>\n<li>The <code>stack_load</code> and <code>stack_store</code> instructions accessing a stack slot will have a preferred alignment that depends on the target ISA.</li>\n<li>Explicitly aligned stack slots may force a dynamic stack realignment anyway. In that case, there's no reason to bound the inferred alignment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A <code>TargetISA</code> method that returns the preferred alignment for accessing a given type seems appropriate.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
