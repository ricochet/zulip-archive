The <code>use_colocated_libcalls</code> setting is not configurable within Wasmtime and as such, they should be loaded into a register prior to emitting the call. This will also ensure that the right 8-byte absolute relocation is used.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

As far as testing goes, this was caught by fuzzing so I think we're good.
