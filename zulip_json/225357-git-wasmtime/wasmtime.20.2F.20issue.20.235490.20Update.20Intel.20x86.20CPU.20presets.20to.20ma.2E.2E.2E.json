We should be able to generate code for any x86 CPU running in 64-bit mode, and if we can't right now I think we're at least close. But I believe we'd need to do a lot more work to support 32-bit mode, so I think it makes sense to just fail if someone requests a target that can only support 32-bit mode.</p>\n<p>I haven't yet checked that, for each target we already supported, the set of features is still correct. I believe you probably got it right, but the LLVM tables are hard enough to read that I think it's worth double-checking, just in case.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think this is the right patch. If you could remove those 32-bit CPUs I'd appreciate it, and hopefully I'll get to double-checking the features lists soon, or talk somebody else into doing it. :grin:</p>\n</blockquote>",
