The major changes in this PR are now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All wasm-tools deps are updated (currently sitting at git deps to my \"bump\" branch)</li>\n<li>WIT syntax is changing, as well as the binary format of components</li>\n<li>All WIT files vendored in this repository are updated to the new syntax. Notably the wasi-http WITs are not updated because they're a submodule. This means that all wasi-http-related tests and support are disabled.</li>\n<li>There is now only one copy of WIT for WASI, and all other duplicate copies are deleted.</li>\n<li>All of the preview2 implementation has been updated for the new hierarchy of modules created by <code>wasmtime::component::bindgen!</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One interesting aspect of this is that there's a temporary git dependency on wit-bindgen. I'm not actually sure how to get rid of that because the adapter requires wit-bindgen and it's not easy to remove that. This is somewhat ok though since we don't publish anything with wit-bindgen so I'm hoping it's ok to have a temporary state of affairs with a git dep here before I can go use this PR to update wit-bindgen to make a release there.</p>\n</blockquote>",
