The original<br>\nsupport for adding interruption to WebAssembly was added pretty early on<br>\nin the history of Wasmtime when there was no other method to prevent an<br>\ninfinite loop from the host. Nowadays, however, there are alternative<br>\nmethods for interruption such as fuel or epoch-based interruption.</p>\n<p>One of the major downsides of <code>Config::interruptable</code> is that even when<br>\nit's not enabled it forces an atomic swap to happen when entering<br>\nWebAssembly code. This technically could be a non-atomic swap if the<br>\nconfiguration option isn't enabled but that produces even more branch-y<br>\ncode on entry into WebAssembly which is already something we try to<br>\noptimize. Calling into WebAssembly is on the order of a dozens of<br>\nnanoseconds at this time and an atomic swap, even uncontended, can add<br>\nup to 5ns on some platforms.</p>\n<p>The main goal of this PR is to remove this atomic swap on entry into<br>\nWebAssembly. This is done by removing the <code>Config::interruptable</code> field<br>\nentirely, moving all existing consumers to epochs instead which are<br>\nsuitable for the same purposes. This means that the stack overflow check<br>\nis no longer entangled with the interruption check and perhaps one day<br>\nwe could continue to optimize that further as well.</p>\n<p>Some consequences of this change are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Epochs are now the only method of remote-thread interruption.</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are no more Wasmtime traps that produces the <code>Interrupted</code> trap<br>\n  code, although we may wish to move future traps to this so I left it<br>\n  in place.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The C API support for interrupt handles was also removed and bindings<br>\n  for epoch methods were added.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Function-entry checks for interruption are a tiny bit less efficient<br>\n  since one check is performed for the stack limit and a second is<br>\n  performed for the epoch as opposed to the <code>Config::interruptable</code><br>\n  style of bundling the stack limit and the interrupt check in one. It's<br>\n  expected though that this is likely to not really be measurable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The old <code>VMInterrupts</code> structure is renamed to <code>VMRuntimeLimits</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
