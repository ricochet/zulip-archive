These were<br>\npreviously sometimes mentioned in different orders which means that<br>\nconverting between the two took a little extra code than before. This<br>\ncommit is a micro-optimization to align the types across the various<br>\nplaces we define these to help reduce the codegen burden when converting<br>\nbetween these types.</p>\n<p>This is not expected to have a major impact on performance, rather it's<br>\na small cleanup which should be easy-ish to preserve I've noticed while<br>\nstaring at assembly.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
