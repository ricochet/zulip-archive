I'd want to confirm that your embedding use case still works if this is removed. Additionally this is mostly just pointing out that it's not necessary to have this directive to get things working. That being said I can imagine it's still convenient to have because you'd only need one Cargo manifest directive instead of two. </p>\n<p>If y'all would prefer I think it would make sense to keep this but as <code>pub use wasmtime</code> instead of <code>pub use wasmtime::*</code> so you could access all of the internals but it wouldn't clash namespaces ideally. In any case I'd like to leave <code>main</code> as-is until y'all have weighed in over here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
