There are two major features which changed, both related to components, which required updates in Wasmtime:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Resource types are now implemented in wasm-tools and they're not yet implemented in Wasmtime so I've stubbed out the integration point with panics as reminders to come back and implement them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are new validation rules about how aggregate types must be named. This doesn't affect runtime internals at all but was done on behalf of code generators. This did however affect a number of tests which have to ensure that types are exported.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
