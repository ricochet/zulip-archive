Every user of Context::compile_and_emit in Cranelift didn't actually need ownership over the machine code bytes and thus would have been able to use Context::compile instead to avoid an unnecessary allocation. This commit moves all in-tree users of compile_and_emit to compile and additionally to avoid other users adding an unnecessary allocation as they though it to be necessary, this commit additionally deprecates compile_and_emit.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
