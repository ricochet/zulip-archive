Notably Unix semantics [indicate]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before any action described below is taken, and if nbyte is zero<br>\nand the file is a regular file, the write() function may detect<br>\nand return errors as described below. In the absence of errors,<br>\nor if error detection is not performed, the write() function<br>\nshall return zero and have no other results. If nbyte is zero and<br>\nthe file is not a regular file, the results are unspecified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These semantics are a bit easier to emulate on Windows so the host implementation now discards any attempt to perform I/O if a zero-sized write is detected.</p>\n<p>[indicate]: <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/write.3p.html\">https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/write.3p.html</a></p>\n<p>Closes #7633</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
