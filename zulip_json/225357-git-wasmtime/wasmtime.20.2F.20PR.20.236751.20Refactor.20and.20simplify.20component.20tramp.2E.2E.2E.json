There was already 6 different types and I was adding two more<br>\nand I had to touch just a few too many places to get this done. In the<br>\nend I decided to refactor how trampolines are handled in the component<br>\nmodel to make it much easier to add new kinds of trampolines.</p>\n<p>To that end the type-specific counts/lists/etc are all gone now in favor<br>\nof a single concept of a trampoline. This means components now track<br>\ntrampolines in-bulk rather than individually by type. For example<br>\ncompiling trampolines is now a loop over \"compile this list of<br>\ntrampolines\" where previously it was N loops for the N types of<br>\ntrampolines. The <code>Trampoline</code> definition is where the enum and dispatch<br>\nhappens where that contains all possible trampolines that a component<br>\ncould require.</p>\n<p>This ended up being a large refactor to the Cranelift component<br>\nintegration, but there is not intended to be any functional change from<br>\nthis refactoring. Additionally all trampolines are now removed from the<br>\nglobal initializers list since there's nothing preventing them from<br>\nbeing initialized earlier on during the instantiation process.</p>\n<p>Overall this should drastically reduce the number of locations that need<br>\nto have trampoline-specific knowledge to translation, the dataflow<br>\ngraph, and compilation. Nearly everything else can operate over<br>\neverything in bulk and forward between these systems.</p>\n</blockquote>",
