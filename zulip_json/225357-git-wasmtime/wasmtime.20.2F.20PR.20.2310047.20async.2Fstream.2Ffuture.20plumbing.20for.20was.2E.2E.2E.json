The <code>wasmtime::runtime</code>, <code>wasmtime_environ::fact</code>, and <code>wasmtime_cranelift::compiler::component</code> modules only contain <code>todo!()</code> stubs to begin with; I'll flesh those out in later PRs.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",

I dimly recall that you wanted me to switch most or all of them over to libcalls, and that that would involve adding a bunch of new methods to the <code>VMStore</code> trait, but I can't remember the details.  Perhaps you could walk me through that next week.</p>\n</blockquote>",
