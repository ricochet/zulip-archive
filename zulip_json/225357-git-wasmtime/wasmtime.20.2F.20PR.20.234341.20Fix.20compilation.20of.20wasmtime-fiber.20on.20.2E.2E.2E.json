This switches instead<br>\nto an <code>adrp</code> and <code>add</code> pair which seems to convince the linker that the<br>\nrelocations should all fit. The same pattern is used on Linux as well<br>\nonly it has different syntax (so much for a portable assembler) for<br>\nconsistency. Performance isn't really an issue here so there's no need<br>\nto go out of our way to get the single-instruction operand working.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
