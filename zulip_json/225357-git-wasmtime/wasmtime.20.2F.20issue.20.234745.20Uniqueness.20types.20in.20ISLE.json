Perhaps less magic is warranted here, indeed. I wonder if removing the <code>sink_inst</code> implicit converter (so the implicit conversions for memory operands) is enough, while leaving Value-&gt;Reg intact. (I can convince myself if I squint right that \"get the register for a value\" is an idempotent operation, which we allow for implicit conversions, while \"sink the load\" is an operation that includes the side-effect of disallowing one to use the original result register, so should not be an implicit conversion.)</p>\n<p>All of that said, there is still a safety issue here where it is <em>possible</em> to write a rule that does both, while affine types allow us to encode the restriction directly. I like that as an aspirational goal, but maybe we don't have to get there in one step.</p>\n</blockquote>",
