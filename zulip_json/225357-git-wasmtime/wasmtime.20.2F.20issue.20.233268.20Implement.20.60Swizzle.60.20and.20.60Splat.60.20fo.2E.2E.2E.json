I can't remember off the top of my head if there is a way to constrain the tests to just the new backend, which is a potential solution. But I have a suspicion that the type conversion I mentioned above could also be causing the issue (i.e., if we only retain the <code>i8x16</code> version, does the old backend pass?).</p>\n</blockquote>",
