How is the current <code>#[cfg_attr(not(target_arch = \"x86_64\"), ignore)]</code> correct, though? When run on a non-SystemV-OS, I would guess the test should run into similar calling convention errors...</p>\n</blockquote>",

After this change the OS is also included, which can override the default calling convention. An alternative to this PR would be to add a dev-dependency on cranelift-codegen to cranelift-frontend with the x86_64 backend enabled.</p>\n</blockquote>",
