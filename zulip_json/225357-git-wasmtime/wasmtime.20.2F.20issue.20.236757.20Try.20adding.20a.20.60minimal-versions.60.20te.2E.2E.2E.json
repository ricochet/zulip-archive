Guessing that 1.x.x track version number is not easy, and I'm not sure if that current number is going to be the same a few months from now. I've not use <code>-Z minimal-versions</code> myself so I don't know how this will fare on CI over time.</p>\n<p>One option I think is to simply not have this PR as well. It's a pretty niche issue that likely won't crop up much, so I'm not sure what to do about it.</p>\n</blockquote>",

One class of failures can show up in transitive dependencies which can look quite bizarre. Other failures though may be more obvious in that a PR may update usage of a crate and the error from CI would say \"this function isn't available\" which may serve as a reminder to update the minimum version requirement.</p>\n<p>Either way I can document more in the CI configuration, although my guess is that few will read that before posting on zulip \"it's broke why?\", but worth a shot!</p>\n</blockquote>",
