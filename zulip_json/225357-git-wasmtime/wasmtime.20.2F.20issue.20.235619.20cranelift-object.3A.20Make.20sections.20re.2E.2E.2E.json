The old version is a dependency of <code>indexmap</code> which itself is a dependency of 3-4 other crates, and I figured this would be a good place to stop.</p>\n<p>Also <code>hashbrown</code> has moved some of their API that we used behind a feature flag.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of us will need to vet the diff for the object upgrade; I'll get to this in a bit if no one else does first!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span aria-label=\"+1\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44d\" role=\"img\" title=\"+1\">:+1:</span>, You also recently did a similar vet for <code>object</code> up to <code>0.30</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5434#issuecomment-1350337637\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5434#issuecomment-1350337637</a> so we're just missing <code>0.30 -&gt; 0.30.3</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
