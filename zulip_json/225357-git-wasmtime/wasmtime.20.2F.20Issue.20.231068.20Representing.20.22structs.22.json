It would be better to provide the ability for users to specify an alignment value for each stack slot.</p>\n<p>One tricky detail is that Cranelift doesn't yet support dynamically realigning the stack in case someone might use such a mechanism to request an alignment value greater than the platform ABI provides for the stack pointer, however it seems like Cranelift could just fail to compile just cases for now.</p>\n</blockquote>",
