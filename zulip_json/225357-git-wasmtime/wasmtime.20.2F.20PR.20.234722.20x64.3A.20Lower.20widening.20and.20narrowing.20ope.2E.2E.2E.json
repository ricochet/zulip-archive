Is there something in the Wasm translator that generates code with an explicitly incorrect type?</p>\n<p>Likewise ignoring the second argument below seems outright wrong: if the semantics of <code>snarrow</code> are that it combines lanes of the two vectors, the lanes of <code>b</code> should show up somewhere.</p>\n<p>I suspect this is a weird shoehorning of different semantics into a particular combo of ops (ie, the frontend generates exactly this shape, and the backend agrees that it means something different than what the actual instruction semantics, composed, would mean. We should fix this if so as it's a correctness bug waiting to happen!</p>\n<p>A way to find out if this is the case is: what happens if we remove this specialization? We have generic lowerings for <code>snarrow</code> and <code>fcvt_to_sint_sat</code>; do those two lowerings, composed together, give a correct result for whatever code is meant to hit this rule?</p>\n<p>cc @abrown @jlb6740 for more thoughts on this (you may remember more history here?)</p>\n</blockquote>",

In other words what change is the TODO proposing in the instruction definitions?</p>\n<p>I'm also curious whether removing this special case results in correct execution still; if not then that's a sign that we're trying to fit extra meaning into the combo here that shouldn't exist.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The comment from <a href=\"http://lower.rs\">lower.rs</a> backs this up by suggesting that this is the translation of <code>i32x4.trunc_sat_f64x2_s_zero</code>, and the translation of that operation produces the sequence that this rule matches.</p>\n<p>I think that if we implement the signed and unsigned narrowings for <code>I64X2</code> we could probably remove this special case and have the general case work, but just removing it now will cause test failures. It might be worth keeping the special case if it turns out that it avoids some unnecessary work, and <code>i32x4.trunc_sat_f64x2_{s,u}_zero</code> is a common enough operation.</p>\n</blockquote>",
