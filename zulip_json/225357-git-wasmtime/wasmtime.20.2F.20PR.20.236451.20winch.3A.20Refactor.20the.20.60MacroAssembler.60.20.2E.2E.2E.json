Some of them borrowed <code>&amp;self</code> and some didn't, but in practice, there's no need to have any of them borrow <code>&amp;self</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
