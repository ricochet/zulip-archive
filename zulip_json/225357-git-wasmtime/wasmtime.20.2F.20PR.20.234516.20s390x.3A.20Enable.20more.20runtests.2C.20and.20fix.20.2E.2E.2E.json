Doing so<br>\nuncovered a two back-end bugs, which are fixed as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The result of cls was always off by one.</li>\n<li>The result of popcnt.i16 has uninitialized high bits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, I found a bug in the load-op-store.clif test case:<br>\n     v3 = heap_addr.i64 heap0, v1, 4<br>\n     v4 = iconst.i64 42<br>\n     store.i32 v4, v3<br>\nThis was clearly intended to perform a 32-bit store, but<br>\nactually performs a 64-bit store (it seems the type annotation<br>\nof the store opcode is ignored, and the type of the operand<br>\nis used instead).  That bug did not show any noticable symptoms<br>\non little-endian architectures, but broke on big-endian.</p>\n<p>FYI @cfallin @afonso360 </p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
