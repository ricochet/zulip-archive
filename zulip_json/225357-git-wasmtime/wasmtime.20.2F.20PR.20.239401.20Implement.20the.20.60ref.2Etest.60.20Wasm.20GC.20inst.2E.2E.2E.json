This is known to be suboptimal. (FWIW, we also emit a fast path in front of the libcall where we first check the actual type and expected type for equality and skip the libcall if they are equal.)</p>\n<p>This implementation is expected to be improved in the future by exposing a module's types' supertypes arrays to Wasm, so that the Wasm can do the O(1) subtype checks inline. This will make the vast majority of all <code>ref.test</code>s inlinable. After that, the only remaining case that would require out-of-line libcalls would be when a module is given an instance of a type that it did not itself define (but which could be a subtype of a type it defined, for example, and which itself might not even have been defined until after this module's instance was created!)</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
