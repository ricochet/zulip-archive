We currently use libcalls to do id-to-funcref conversion when reading a <code>funcref</code> out from a GC object and to intern a <code>funcref</code> and get its associated table ID when writing the <code>funcref</code> into a GC object. libcalls on field/element access are very much not ideal from a performance perspective.</p>\n<p>I wrote up some thoughts on how we could improve the situation in the original PR:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My most-immediate thoughts are that we would do roughly the following to speed this up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expose the slab to Wasm, allowing id-to-funcref conversion to happen fully within wasm code</li>\n<li>for funcref-to-id conversion, add an LRU/associative cache to the vmctx (or maybe runtime limits) to cache the results of the libcall and allow the happy path to stay within wasm code. the slow path would still fall back to a libcall however (I do not want to implement hashing in wasm code and try to keep it in sync with the Rust hashing)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My hope is that the above would result in good enough perf for us to not have to revisit this for quite a while.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>_Originally posted by @fitzgen in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/9341#issuecomment-2386456719_\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/9341#issuecomment-2386456719_</a></p>\n</blockquote>",

So we would have to rely on pre-allocating (virtual) memory, and not allow passing new, dynamically-created <code>wasmtime::Func</code>s to Wasm beyond that pre-allocated limit.</p>\n<h4>Idea 2</h4>\n<p>Expose the id-to-funcref slab to Wasm, as described above. (Potentially not useing <code>wasmtime::Slab</code> anymore, but instead some simpler type that is more easily exposed to Wasm code.)</p>\n<p>But instead of worrying about interning and/or wasting space and/or doing GC to clean up unused entries, we do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add an <code>id: Option&lt;FuncRefId&gt;</code> field to <code>VMFuncRef</code></li>\n<li>when doing <code>funcref</code>-to-id conversion:<ul>\n<li>if <code>(*funcref).id</code> is some, then we reuse the existing id</li>\n<li>otherwise, when it is none, we do a libcall to push the <code>funcref</code> into the side table (or just push onto the slab directly in Wasm code) and set the <code>id</code> field to the new entry's index</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
