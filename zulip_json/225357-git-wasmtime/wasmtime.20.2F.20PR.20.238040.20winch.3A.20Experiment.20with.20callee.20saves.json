Additionally if winch follows the cranelift abi, we can remove the winch implementations of all trampolines, replacing them with the ones that the wasmtime-cranelift crate already generates. While that would introduce a dependency on cranelift from winch, the trampolines are all small and would likely not affect compilation performance.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
