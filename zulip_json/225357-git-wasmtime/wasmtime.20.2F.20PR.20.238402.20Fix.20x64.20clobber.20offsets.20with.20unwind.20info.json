I was thinking that the canonical frame address (CFA) is always at a constant offset from the SP for any given PC (I think this holds true for us, since we don't have any <code>alloca</code>s) and that whenever we increment the SP, we always want to increment the offset to the CFA (i.e. emit an unwind inst) by the same amount. Not sure that this actually aligns 100% with what we are trying to do in general, though.</p>\n</blockquote>",
