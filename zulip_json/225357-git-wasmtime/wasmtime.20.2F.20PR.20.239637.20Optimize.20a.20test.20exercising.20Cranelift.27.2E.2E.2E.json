Previously in debug mode this test took upwards of 40 seconds to execute and now it takes around 5. The main optimization here was to disable Cranelift optimizations. The test has also been updated to generate the module with <code>wasm-encoder</code> instead of <code>wast</code> to skip the text parsing step too.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
