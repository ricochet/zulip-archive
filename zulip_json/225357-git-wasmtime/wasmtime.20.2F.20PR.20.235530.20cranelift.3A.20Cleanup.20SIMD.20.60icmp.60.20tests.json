In particular #3335 and #3334 which were actually issues with our trampolines not supporting SIMD booleans.</p>\n<p>We've since removed booleans entierly, and we actually have all of those tests in our test suite already, but disabled.</p>\n<p>This PR enables the <code>simd-icmp</code> tests for the backends that support them. Additionally it moves some icmp tests that were in a generic <code>simd-comparision</code> file into the existing files, and leaves the remaining files in the <code>simd-fcmp.clif</code> file.</p>\n<p>SIMD Unsigned <code>icmp</code> does not seem to be implemented on x86_64 for <code>i64x2</code>, I've opened  #5529 to track this.</p>\n<p>Closes #3334<br>\nCloses #3335</p>\n</blockquote>",
