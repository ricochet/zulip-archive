It isn't entirely satisfying, in part because it's an unsafe interface -- it doesn't perform bounds checking on the underlying data. While we can provide relatively safe interfaces to protect users from misusing the API, it's harder to be absolutely certain that the number of bytes <code>compile</code> says a function needs is the number of bytes <code>emit_to_memory</code> actually writes for that function.</p>\n<p>One option would be to provide a safe checked version of <code>MemoryCodeSink</code>. However, it's also worth considering evaluating available crates that provide low-level byte buffer writing functionality, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/bytevec\">https://crates.io/crates/bytevec</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/bytebuffer\">https://crates.io/crates/bytebuffer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/scroll\">https://crates.io/crates/scroll</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
