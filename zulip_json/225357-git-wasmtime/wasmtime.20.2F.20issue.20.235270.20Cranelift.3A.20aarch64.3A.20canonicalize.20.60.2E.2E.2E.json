In general this is pretty nice to have, since it turns a four instruction sequence into a two instruction sequence.</p>\n<p>Follow up issue from:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the future, we could try and \"rotate\" <code>const &lt;= value</code> into <code>value &gt;= const</code> and then go through this same optimization path so that we don't need to duplicate the rules but with tiny tweaks. I opted not to do that in this PR and removed the buggy optimizations to just get this land-able.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>_Originally posted by @fitzgen in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5252#issuecomment-1315621231_\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/5252#issuecomment-1315621231_</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
