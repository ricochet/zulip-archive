There are various cases in which function prologues and epilogues need to be modified depending on ISA specifics such as supported extensions, e.g. any prototyping work for <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/issues/19\">bytecodealliance/rfcs#19</a>, so this PR adds the necessary plumbing to the generic ABI implementation.</p>\n</blockquote>",
