However that function only uses type information to construct the fully-qualified name of the extractor, which is not used when building the IR. So removing it and removing the now-unused <code>typeenv</code> parameters removes all uses of <code>TypeEnv</code> from the <code>ir</code> and <code>trie</code> modules.</p>\n<p>In addition, this completes the changes started in \"More consistent use of <code>add_inst</code>\" (e63771f2d921cdce440620dbf38bd3e186747b1e), by always using <code>add_inst</code> to get an <code>InstId</code>.</p>\n<p>I also removed a number of unnecessary intermediate allocations.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
