(#6726)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cranelift: upgrade to regalloc2 0.9.2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This pulls in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/regalloc2/issues/152\">bytecodealliance/regalloc2#152</a>, which fixes a bug that is reachable on RISC-V: when two different register classes have the same stackslot size, the register allocation result might share a slot between two different classes, which can result in moves between classes that will cause a panic. The fix properly separates slots by class.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cargo-vet update for regalloc2 0.9.2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
