For the new internal representation of <code>V128</code>, we use an unaligned byte array. This lowers the alignment requirements for <code>V128</code> to 1 rather than 16, which means that <code>Val</code> no longer requires padding after its discriminant before the storage for its <code>V128</code> variant, which in turn allows its size to shrink from 32 to 24 bytes.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
