Rather than expanding, we treat the term like an external extractor. This change adds a flag to the <code>TermEnv</code> and exposes a new public function (alongside <code>compile</code>) called <code>envs_for_analysis</code> that sets the flag to false. Draft for now to get feedback on approach and improve the unit testing.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
