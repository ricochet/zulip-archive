There's a lot of optimization rules around just bnot and just band, but most of them don't mention the fused form of <code>band_not</code> (or other forms like <code>bor_not</code>). I tried adding a simple \"band_not is equivalent to (band (bnot))\" rule but it ended up not generating the <code>band_not</code> instruction.

If we fix #3059 then these rules would never match for anything but I64.</p>\n<p>With the recently-merged #5706, you can write these this way instead:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"suggestion\"><pre><span></span><code>(rule (simplify (bxor ty (iconst ty k) x))\n (if-let -1 (i64_sextend_imm64 ty k))\n (subsume (bnot ty x)))\n(rule (simplify (bxor ty x (iconst ty k)))\n (if-let -1 (i64_sextend_imm64 ty k))\n (subsume (bnot ty x)))\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The other thing to note though is I think these rules shouldn't use <code>subsume</code>. If both operands to <code>bxor</code> are constants, then we'd prefer to apply the constant folding rules instead of emitting a <code>bnot</code> instruction. If multiple rules use <code>subsume</code>, we don't specify which rule will win; it currently depends on details of how ISLE does codegen that are difficult to predict.</p>\n<p>But I don't know yet what advice to give about when to use <code>subsume</code>. Struggling with that question led me to file #5704 today.</p>\n</blockquote>",
