The <code>wait</code> always immediately returned, meaning that the main thread essentially spins until a counter is atomically incremented. This is fine for test correctness, but was not the original intent, which was lost in a refactoring. This change uses the <code>$i</code> local to keep track of the counter value we expect to see for the <code>wait</code>, so that the <code>wait</code>/<code>notify</code> pair actually waits as expected.</p>\n<p>[here]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5484#discussion_r1101200012\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/5484#discussion_r1101200012</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
