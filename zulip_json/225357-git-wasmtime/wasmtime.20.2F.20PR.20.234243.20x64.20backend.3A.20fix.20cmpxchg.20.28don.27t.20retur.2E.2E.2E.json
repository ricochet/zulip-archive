However, this breaks a number of invariants, and<br>\neventually causes a regalloc panic if used as a blockparam arg (pinned<br>\nvregs cannot be used in this way).</p>\n<p>In general we have to return regular vregs, not a RealReg, as results of<br>\ninstructions during lowering. However #4223 added a helper for<br>\n<code>x64_cmpxchg</code> that returns a literal <code>rax</code>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately we can do the right thing here by just giving a fresh vreg<br>\nto the instruction; the regalloc constraints mean that this vreg is<br>\nconstrained to <code>rax</code> at the instruction (at its def/late point), so the<br>\ngenerator of the instruction need not worry about <code>rax</code> here.</p>\n<p>Fixes second issue reported by @bjorn3 in #4234.</p>\n<p>cc/fyi @abrown, but I missed this in review (sorry!).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
