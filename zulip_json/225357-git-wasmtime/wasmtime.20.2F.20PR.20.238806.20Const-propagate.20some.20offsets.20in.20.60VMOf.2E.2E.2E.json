All of the fields at the start of <code>VMOffsets</code>, however, are statically known given the pointer size. Notably this means that the use of <code>HostPtr</code> in the runtime still was forcing a dynamic lookup of these static offsets.</p>\n<p>This commit refactors this to reflect all static offsets based solely on the pointer size in the <code>PtrSize</code> trait, removing all the fields from <code>VMOffsets</code>. All the dynamically sized fields, however, remain in <code>VMOffsets</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
