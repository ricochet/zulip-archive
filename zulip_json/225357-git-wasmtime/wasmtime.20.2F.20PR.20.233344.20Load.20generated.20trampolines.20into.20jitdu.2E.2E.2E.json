It's also updated to learn about<br>\ntrampolines generated via <code>Func::new</code> and friends. These trampolines<br>\nwere all not previously registered meaning that stack traces with these<br>\npc values would be confusing to see in the profile output. While the<br>\nnames aren't the best it should at least be more clear than before if a<br>\nfunction is hot!</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

See the jitdump support in this PR for an idea of the kind of thing needed. I don't know exactly what is needed for VTune.</p>\n</blockquote>",
