Previously these instructions allowed for 32-bits of stack space in addition to saving/restoring all 32 X-registers. In reality though it's quite uncommon to need more than 16-bits of stack space and ABI-wise the most commonly saved registers are the upper 16 registers of the X register set.</p>\n<p>This commit therefore shrinks the frame size to 16 bits and only has the ability to save/restore the upper 16 X-registers. Note that any clobbered registers and frame sizes are still supported, they'll just use more pessimal encodings which aren't a single opcode. If a function uses &gt;64KiB of stack space though it's probably not too important what the dispatch cost is at the beginning.</p>\n<p>The overall result of this change is that each instruction shaves of 4 bytes (2 from the frame size and 2 from the registers being saved/restored). This results in a 4% faster execution time on the bz2 Sightglass benchmark, ~1% on pulldown-cmark, and while it shrinks <code>spidermonkey.cwasm</code> slightly it's not significant.</p>\n<p>While here this commit also removes the Cranelift-unused instructions of <code>x{push,pop}{,_many}</code> since the <code>RegSet</code> type was repurposed as an <code>UpperRegSet</code> instead. It's possible to bring back these instructions but they're otherwise not used right now.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
