The reason for this PR to exist is simply that the Go's implementation of wasmtime (as <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go\">wasmtime-go</a>) has been missing way too many features from its Rust counterpart, and we really need BOTH to work on the same page. There's a set of projects we are working on right now and part of its job can ONLY be done in Go. However the gap between two implementation due to the absence of relevant C-API is irritating, and it feels like it is never a part of plan to allow the users with Go to do as much as Rust users can. If so, it is pretty sad, as I believe Go has its significance as much as Rust do. </p>\n<p>It is not a bad idea to switch over to wasi preview2, but I am concerned about the amount of work needed to fill the gap in wasmtime-go, given it looks like not as popular and already fell short on features in preview 1. In the long run I believe it is definitely worth considering, though, if it implements a much more consistent feature set in across all ports. Specifically, the ability to inject sockets AFTER instance has been created/running.</p>\n<p>A discussion will be nice to have, we can start by setting up a covert communication channel. Please feel free to shoot me an email if you wish.  </p>\n</blockquote>",

I realize this is what Go seems to do with <code>uintptr</code> as the return value from the <code>Fd()</code> method, but that's not how I'd personally do it. That being said I also don't have a lot of prior experience to draw from. Everything in Rust is \"just use <code>File</code>\" which isn't an option in C and otherwise I'm not aware of any C libraries that handle the Windows/Unix distinction as they generally take an fd and then don't work on Windows. To me though casting <code>int</code> in C to <code>void*</code> just to pass it to this function feels a bit too weird.</p>\n<p>Otherwise though another comment I would have is that <code>#[cfg]</code> can be applied on a much more granular level than the entire function, so I'd recommend avoiding duplication of the entire function bodies in Rust with something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">#[cfg(unix)]</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">file</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">File</span>::<span class=\"n\">from_raw_fd</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">the_argument</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">#[cfg(windows)]</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">file</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">File</span>::<span class=\"n\">from_raw_handle</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">the_argumet</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>(or something like that)</p>\n</blockquote>",

The Rust version of those is <code>Raw*</code> in the standard library.
