There are some specific changes I want to draw attention to though.</p>\n<p>Asking new contributors to pick a reviewer is a waste of time for two reasons: Only people with write access to the repository are allowed to pick reviewers, and new contributors have no idea who would be a good reviewer for their PR anyway. So I'm deleting all mention of that. We now auto-assign reviewers instead.</p>\n<p>By the time someone is opening a PR, asking them to open an issue just makes extra work for everyone. They've already picked an approach without discussing it; we might as well look at what they did. We may then have to ask them to take a different approach, but at that point, asking them to open an issue won't save them any effort.</p>\n<p>I removed mention of tests from the pull request template. There are many things we'd like to see in a PR, and we may have to ask for them during review if the contributor doesn't follow our development process documentation. But I think the only crucial information for starting a review is the two questions I'm leaving in the template: why do you want this, and where can I find more context?</p>\n<p>The code of conduct link still had the branch name as <code>master</code>, which is a hint at how long it's been since anyone reviewed it.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
