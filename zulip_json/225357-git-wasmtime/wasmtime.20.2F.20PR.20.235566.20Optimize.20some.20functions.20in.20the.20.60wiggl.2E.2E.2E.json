The documentation doesn't explicitly say anything, the documentation of LLVM about their memcpy intrinsic doesn't say anything to this effect, nor does <code>memcpy</code>-the-function say anything. The linked issue here is the best place to discuss this and its future resolution.</p>\n</blockquote>",
