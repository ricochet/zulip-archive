Namely all the generated types now need names to satisfy possible restrictions depending on the structure. For simplicity everything is given a name to avoid having to special case some vs others which isn't the purpose of this fuzz target.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
