This means that<br>\ninputs from oss-fuzz may not be easily reproducible locally because<br>\nfiles could be read in different orders, so indexes could be distinct.</p>\n<p>This commit instead reads the directory paths, then sorts them, then<br>\nincludes them for testing. That way fuzz inputs at a specific commit<br>\nshould be consistent.</p>\n</blockquote>",
