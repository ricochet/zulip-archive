This PR fixes it to compile again.</p>\n<p>This also includes a simple fix in the typechecking: when verifying that<br>\na term decl is valid, we might insert a term ID into the name-&gt;ID map<br>\nbefore fully checking that all of the types exist, and then skipping<br>\n(for error recovery purposes) the actual push onto the term-signature<br>\nvector if one of the types does have an error. This phantom TID can<br>\nlater cause a panic. The fix is to avoid adding to the map until we have<br>\nfully verified the term decl.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
