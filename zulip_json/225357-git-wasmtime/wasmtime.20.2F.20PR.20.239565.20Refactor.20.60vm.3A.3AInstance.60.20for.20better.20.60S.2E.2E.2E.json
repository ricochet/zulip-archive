This is a pretty fundamental unsafe aspect of implementing a language runtimne in Rust, but we can tighten things up a bit and make them a little safer than they currently are. This commit is such an attempt and is notably tackling the issue of creating multiple store borrows after we have an instance borrow.</p>\n<p>This commit makes the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>Instance</code> doesn't expose a method to get the raw <code>*mut dyn VMStore</code> pointer or otherwise create a store borrow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You cannot construct an <code>Instance</code> directly from a <code>vmctx</code> pointer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is now an <code>InstanceAndStore</code> type that represents unique access to both an <code>Instance</code> and a <code>Store</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can (with <code>unsafe</code>) create an <code>InstanceAndStore</code> from a raw <code>vmctx</code> pointer. This generally only happens inside a couple \"bottlenecks\", not all throughout the codebase, like the shared plumbing code for libcalls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>InstanceAndStore</code> can be unpacked into a mutable borrow of an <code>Instance</code> and a mutable borrow of a <code>Store</code>. This unpacking takes holds a mutable borrow of the original <code>InstanceAndStore</code>, so double borrows of the store are no longer a concern, so long as you don't use <code>unsafe</code> to create new <code>InstanceAndStore</code>s for the same <code>vmctx</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All <code>Instance</code> methods and functions that previously would unsafely turn the <code>Instance</code>'s internal store pointer into a store borrow to perform some action now take a store argument, and this store is threaded around as necessary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Altogether, I feel that we've ended up with an architecture that is a safety improvement over where we were previously, and will help us properly avoid Rust UB.</p>\n<p>For what its worth, I do not think this is the end state. I foresee at least two additional follow ups that I unfortunately do not currently have time for:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create <code>ComponentInstanceAndStore</code>, which is the same thing that this commit did but for components. I started on this but ran out of fuel while trying to update macros for all the component shims and transcoders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stop dealing with <code>&amp;mut vm::Table</code>s and <code>&amp;mut vm::Global</code>s and all that in the runtime. Instead just deal with indices, similar to how things are structured in the host API level. This refactoring was not previously possible due to (1) the <code>wasmtime</code> versus <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> crate split and (2) the lack of <code>StoreOpaque</code>s threaded through the VM internals. The first blocker was addressed a few months ago, this commit removes the second blocker. This will still be a pretty large refactoring though, but I think ultimately will be worth it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
