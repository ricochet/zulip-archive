The scheme your patch introduces, with edges that are labeled by priorities, is more or less what this PR is replacing. The key invariant that makes this PR work is that edges are <em>not</em> labeled by priority, and rules of different priorities are allowed to share an edge, but we limit the overlap to maintain priority ordering (the frontier).</p>\n</blockquote>",
