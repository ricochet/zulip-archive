You can answer the questions below if<br>\nthey're relevant and delete this text before submitting. Thanks for opening an<br>\nissue! --&gt;</p>\n<h4>Feature</h4>\n<p>LLVM has support for performing the stack probes directly in the function prologue instead of calling an external function. (see <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77885\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77885</a> for using this in Rust)</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>This can be faster due to being able to unroll the stack probe loop. It also avoids having to provide an external stack probe function. This makes it possible to enable stack probing in cg_clif. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/issues/661\">https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/issues/661</a>)</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>This should only be implemented for the machinst backends. It should probably be added to either the <code>gen_prologue</code> implementation or <code>gen_prologue</code> caller.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Keep using an external stack probe function with the associated drawbacks.</p>\n</blockquote>",
