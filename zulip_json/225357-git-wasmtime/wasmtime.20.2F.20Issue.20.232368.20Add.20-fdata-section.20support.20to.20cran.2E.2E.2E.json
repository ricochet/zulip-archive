You can answer the questions below if<br>\nthey're relevant and delete this text before submitting. Thanks for opening an<br>\nissue! --&gt;</p>\n<h4>Feature</h4>\n<p>This is the data object counterpart to <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2218\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2218</a>.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>Same as <code>per_function_sections</code>. From the description of #2218:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This makes it possible for the linker to omit unused functions when --gc-sections is passed.</p>\n<p>For cg_clif the executable size savings are quite big. One example is 26MB when a single .text section is used, but 15MB when a single section for each function is used, which is the same as when compiled using cg_llvm. I will probably disable this in debug mode though as it significantly increases the linking time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>Similar to #2218</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>N/A</p>\n</blockquote>",
