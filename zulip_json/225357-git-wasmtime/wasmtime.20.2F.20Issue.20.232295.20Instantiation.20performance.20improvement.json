But I don't see a way around this as every Linker is connected to a Store, and because I need to create a Store per Instance I can't reuse the Linker (or they would belong to different Stores). Also, I'm capturing some per request environment in the closures and re-using Linkers would be hard in this case.</p>\n<p>For now it's still ok, but as I keep adding functionality I'm afraid this is going to be a big issue.

Having an <code>Instance::reset()</code> would be ideal. Then I just could run a pool of ready Instances and save a lot of work.  Zeroing out the memory could be <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49896578/fastest-way-to-zero-pages-in-linux\">potentially much faster</a> than creating new linear memories.

Running your benchmark produces also a result of around ~60us on my machine. This got me curious so I just dumped the part I was previously benchmarking with a <code>let now = std::time::Instant::now()</code>  &amp; <code>let elapsed = now.elapsed().as_micros()</code> wrapper into citerion and now I'm getting <strong>~120us</strong> for the same code.</p>\n<p>I wasn't sure why the difference was so big, so I went ahead and wrapped the same code block again with <code>Instant::now()</code> inside my app. This resulted in:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">395</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">1123</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">281</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">939</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">306</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">925</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">486</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">517</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">418</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">411</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">329</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">484</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">Elapsed</span>: <span class=\"mi\">506</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">us</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I'm using multiple threads to create the instances and handle the requests.

What plaform are you running on and what does the cpu count look like? I'm not sure if this means that there's high contention, though, it sort of makes sense that the per-iteration time doesn't change too too much in parallel vs non-parallel because there <em>shouldn't</em> be contention. I don't really understand the math behind criterion though to understand whether this is an expected result or not.</p>\n<p>It is interesting though that with a threaded version of your application you're seeing higher overheads than without. That may point to a threading overhead though rather than a wasmtime overhead?</p>\n<p>In any case though we're always looking for ways to improve instantiation time and with new work underway to merge lucet and wasmtime I suspect we'll continue to drive this number down.</p>\n</blockquote>",

But I don't see a way around this as every Linker is connected to a Store, and because I need to create a Store per Instance I can't reuse the Linker (or they would belong to different Stores). Also, I'm capturing some per request environment in the closures and re-using Linkers would be hard in this case.</p>\n<p>For now it's still ok, but as I keep adding functionality I'm afraid this is going to be a big issue. Is there a way I could improve this?</p>\n<p>Also the 16% dealloc seems a bit big, but I'm not sure where this is exactly coming from.</p>\n</blockquote>",
