IMHO, it might be better to merge this now, just in order to have one less outstanding PR to keep track of, and given that everything passes fine for you locally; when we eventually turn the tests back on, after finding the intermittent bug, we will know right away if this has somehow broken in the meantime.</p>\n</blockquote>",
