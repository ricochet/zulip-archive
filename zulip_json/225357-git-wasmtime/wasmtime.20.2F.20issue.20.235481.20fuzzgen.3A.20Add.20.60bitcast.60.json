It'd be nice to know from CI that every insert_* function is callable with the given parameters, before spending a bunch of CPU time at OSS-Fuzz. Maybe also check that the result passes the validator, and maybe even that it compiles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sounds like a good idea, I'm going to give that a try!</p>\n</blockquote>",
