To implement this the backend would emit an absolute 8-byte<br>\nrelocation near all function calls, load that address into a register,<br>\nand then call it. While this technique is simple to implement and easy<br>\nto get right, it has two primary downsides associated with it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Function calls are always indirect which means they are more difficult<br>\n  to predict, resulting in worse performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Generating a relocation-per-function call requires expensive<br>\n  relocation resolution at module-load time, which can be a large<br>\n  contributing factor to how long it takes to load a precompiled module.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To fix these issues, while also somewhat compromising on the previously<br>\nsimple implementation technique, this commit switches wasm calls within<br>\na module to using the <code>colocated</code> flag enabled in Cranelift-speak, which<br>\nbasically means that a relative call instruction is used with a<br>\nrelocation that's resolved relative to the pc of the call instruction<br>\nitself.</p>\n<p>When switching the <code>colocated</code> flag to <code>true</code> this commit is also then<br>\nable to move much of the relocation resolution from <code>wasmtime_jit::link</code><br>\ninto <code>wasmtime_cranelift::obj</code> during object-construction time. This<br>\nfrontloads all relocation work which means that there's actually no<br>\nrelocations related to function calls in the final image, solving both<br>\nof our points above.</p>\n<p>The main gotcha in implementing this technique is that there are<br>\nhardware limitations to relative function calls which mean we can't<br>\nsimply blindly use them. AArch64, for example, can only go +/- 64 MB<br>\nfrom the <code>bl</code> instruction to the target, which means that if the<br>\nfunction we're calling is a greater distance away then we would fail to<br>\nresolve that relocation. On x86_64 the limits are +/- 2GB which are much<br>\nlarger, but theoretically still feasible to hit. Consequently the main<br>\nincrease in implementation complexity is fixing this issue.</p>\n<p>This issue is actually already present in Cranelift itself, and is<br>\ninternally one of the invariants handled by the <code>MachBuffer</code> type. When<br>\ngenerating a function relative jumps between basic blocks have similar<br>\nrestrictions. This commit adds new methods for the <code>MachBackend</code> trait<br>\nand updates the implementation of <code>MachBuffer</code> to account for all these<br>\nnew branches. Specifically the changes to <code>MachBuffer</code> are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For AAarch64 the <code>LabelUse::Branch26</code> value now supports veneers, and<br>\n  AArch64 calls use this to resolve relocations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>emit_island</code> function has been rewritten internally to handle<br>\n  some cases which previously didn't come up before, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When emitting an island the deadline is now recalculated, where<br>\n  previously it was always set to infinitely in the future. This was ok<br>\n  prior since only a <code>Branch19</code> supported veneers and once it was<br>\n  promoted no veneers were supported, so without multiple layers of<br>\n  promotion the lack of a new deadline was ok.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When emitting an island all pending fixups had veneers forced if<br>\n  their branch target wasn't known yet. This was generally ok for<br>\n  19-bit fixups since the only kind getting a veneer was a 19-bit<br>\n  fixup, but with mixed kinds it's a bit odd to force veneers for a<br>\n  26-bit fixup just because a nearby 19-bit fixup needed a veneer.<br>\n  Instead fixups are now re-enqueued unless they're known to be<br>\n  out-of-bounds. This may run the risk of generating more islands for<br>\n  19-bit branches but it should also reduce the number of islands for<br>\n  between-function calls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Otherwise the internal logic was tweaked to ideally be a bit more<br>\n  simple, but that's a pretty subjective criteria in compilers...</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've added some simple testing of this for now.
