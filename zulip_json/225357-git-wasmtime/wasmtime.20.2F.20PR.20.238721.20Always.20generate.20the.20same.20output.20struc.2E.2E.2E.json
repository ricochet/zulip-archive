Not only for replacement purposes but the generated bindings are missing two key pieces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the generated <code>add_to_linker</code> functions bounds and invocations of <code>with</code>-overridden interfaces are all missing. This means that the generated <code>add_to_linker</code> functions don't actually represent the full world.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The generated module hierarchy has \"holes\" for all the modules that are overridden. While it's mostly a minor inconvenience it's also easy enough to generate everything via <code>pub use</code> to have everything hooked up correctly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After this PR it means that each <code>bindgen!</code> macro should, in isolation, work for any other <code>bindgen!</code> macro invocation. It shouldn't be necessary to weave things together and remember how each macro was invoked along the way. This is primarily to unblock #8715 which is running into a case where tcp/udp are generated as sync but their dependency, <code>wasi:sockets/network</code>, is used from an upstream async version. The generated <code>add_to_linker</code> does not compile because tcp/udp depend on <code>wasi:sockets/network</code> isn't added to the linker. After fixing that it then required more modules to be generated, hence this PR.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
