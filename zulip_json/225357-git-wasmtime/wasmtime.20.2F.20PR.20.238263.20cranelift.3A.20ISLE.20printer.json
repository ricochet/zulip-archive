This is intended to support tooling which generates ISLE source code. In such cases, this printer library allows applications to work with ISLE's AST types rather than raw string manipulation, and produce more readable output due to the pretty-printing features.</p>\n<p>Printing is implemented using the <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/pretty\"><code>pretty</code></a> crate, which in turn is an implementation of Wadler's classic Haskell pretty printer for Rust. In order to avoid required dependencies the printer module is guarded by a new <code>printer</code> feature.</p>\n<p>The printer is tested with a new integration test that verifies the print-parse roundtrip property for provided ISLE files.</p>\n<p>In the future, it's possible that an ISLE printer could be used to provide an <code>islefmt</code> tool, but comment representation in the AST would be required before that could be considered.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Nor is there much appetite for adding it according to <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2911\">https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2911</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps if we cared enough we could edit the Github actions workflows to invoke these tests with the right <code>--feature</code> argument. But having poked around the CI config a little, it's not clear how to do that without causing a mess.</p>\n<p>Another option is to have the printer tests in a different crate that can depend on this one with the right feature set.</p>\n<p>All that said, I'm not sure it's worth it just for these tests, but I wanted to mention it in case you had a simple suggestion for how to run them?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Previously I had <code>parse_without_pos</code> in the test binary instead, but that requires you to export <code>Parser</code> itself, and that seems worse.</li>\n<li>We can't guard <code>parse_without_pos</code> with <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> because then it's not visible to an integration test binary.</li>\n<li>Potentially the printer tests could be structured as unit tests instead of modeled off the <code>run_tests.rs</code> binary, which would allow use of conditional compilation for test only.</li>\n<li>We could have an <code>eq_without_pos</code> on AST types instead. However, I assumed that would require a lot of hand- or macro-generated boilerplate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If <code>parse_without_pos</code> really is the best option, I also wondered if it would be nicer to instead augment the <code>parse</code> method with a <code>Positions</code> enum argument to configure whether positions are populated or dropped.</p>\n</blockquote>",
