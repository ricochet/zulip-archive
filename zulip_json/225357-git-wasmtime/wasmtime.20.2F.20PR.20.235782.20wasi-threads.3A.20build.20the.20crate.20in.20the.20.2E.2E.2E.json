This is no change for embedders of Wasmtime: they would still have to include <code>wasmtime-wasi-threads</code> manually. Enabling the crate by default in the CLI application has several benefits, e.g., that it is simpler to experiment with and that it will be part of more test runs (and thus bugs can be discovered more quickly). Users will still have to add<br>\n<code>--wasi-modules=experimental-wasi-threads</code> to enable wasi-threads on the command line.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
