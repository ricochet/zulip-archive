In addition, this<br>\nadds support to use all 32 vector registers to implement floating-<br>\npoint operations, by using vector floating-point instructions with<br>\nthe 'W' bit set to operate only on the first element.</p>\n<p>This part of the vector instruction set mostly matches the old FP<br>\ninstruction set, with two exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There is no vector version of the COPY SIGN instruction.  Instead,<br>\n  now use a VECTOR SELECT with an appropriate bit mask to implement<br>\n  the fcopysign operation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are no vector version of the float &lt;-&gt; int conversion<br>\n  instructions where source and target differ in bit size.  Use<br>\n  appropriate multiple conversion steps instead.  This also requires<br>\n  use of explicit checking to implement correct overflow handling.<br>\n  As a side effect, this version now also implements the i8 / i16<br>\n  variants of all conversions, which had been missing so far.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For all operations except those two above, we continue to use the<br>\nold FP instruction if applicable (i.e. if all operands happen to<br>\nhave been allocated to the original FP register set), and use the<br>\nvector instruction otherwise.</p>\n<p>CC @cfallin </p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
