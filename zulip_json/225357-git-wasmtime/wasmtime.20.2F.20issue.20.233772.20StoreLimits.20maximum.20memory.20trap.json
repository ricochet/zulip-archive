For example the <code>memory.grow</code> instruction only returns -1 on failure, not an error message, so what the wasm module does when -1 is returned is entirely up to it and not something the embedder has control over. Some wasm modules may be buggy on -1 being returned, which may be the behavior you're seeing.</p>\n<p>Otherwise though what you can do is that when the limit is exceeded you can update the state of the <code>StoreLimiter</code> that the limit was exceeded, and then later when building an error report the flag can be checked to indicate that the error may, but is not guaranteed to be, related to the fact that a request for more memory was denied.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The embedder can recognize that memory growth was rejected but beyond that it's up to the embedder to correlate errors.</p>\n</blockquote>",
