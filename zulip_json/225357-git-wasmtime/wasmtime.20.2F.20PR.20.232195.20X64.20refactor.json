This has been proven useful for some temporary variables computations in Spidermonkey (e.g. address of global values).</li>\n<li>Second optimization regenerates constants in new vregs in <code>put_input_to_reg</code>, minimizing their live ranges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a few bonus pieces here and there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fix a few places where regenerating constants would clobber the flags (b/o xor for 0 constants), by reordering calls to <code>put_input_in_reg</code> so they're before the comparison emission.</li>\n<li>fix the generation of R64 constants</li>\n<li>use a mov imm32 sign-extended to reg, whenever possible, when generating an i64 immediate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See also commit details.</p>\n<p>This is up to a 17% speedup in compile times of the embenchen micro benchmarks, and up to 10% reduction in runtime speed.</p>\n</blockquote>",
