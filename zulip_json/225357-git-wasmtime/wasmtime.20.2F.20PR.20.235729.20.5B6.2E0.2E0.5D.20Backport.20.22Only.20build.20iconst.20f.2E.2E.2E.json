No bugs have been reported implicating these optimizations, but this will be the first Cranelift release with egraph optimization enabled by default, so most people wouldn't have run into these bugs sooner.</p>\n<p>Since Wasmtime doesn't use the I128 type, it is not affected by the <code>icmp</code> fix. I'm not sure whether the <code>bxor</code> issue was reachable from WebAssembly.</p>\n</blockquote>",
