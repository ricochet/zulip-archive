This is because core wasm instances must be<br>\ninstantiated in the specified order within a component and that cannot<br>\nchange depending on the dataflow between adapters. This commit fixes a<br>\npossible panic from linearizing the component dfg where an adapter<br>\nmodule tried to depend on an instance that hadn't been instantiated yet<br>\nbecause the ordering dependency between core wasm instances hadn't been<br>\nmodeled.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
