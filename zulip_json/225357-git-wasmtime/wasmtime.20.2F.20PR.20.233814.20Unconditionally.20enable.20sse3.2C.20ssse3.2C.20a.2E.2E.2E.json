From discussion on the wasm simd proposal the<br>\nassumed general baseline for running simd code is SSE4.1 anyway.</p>\n<p>At this time I haven't added any sort of checks in Wasmtime itself.<br>\nWasmtime by default uses the native architecture and when explicitly<br>\nenabling features this still needs to be explicitly specified.</p>\n<p>Closes #3809</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
