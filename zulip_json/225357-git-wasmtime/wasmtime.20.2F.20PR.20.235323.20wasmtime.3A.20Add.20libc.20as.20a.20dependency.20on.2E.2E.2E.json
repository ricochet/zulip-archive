Which will probably build, but not work.</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell membarriers are still in the process of being added.<br>\nSee: <a href=\"https://reviews.freebsd.org/D32360\">https://reviews.freebsd.org/D32360</a></p>\n<p>Since FreeBSD is mirroring the Linux membarrier syscall we may be able to reuse the same implementation for both Linux and FreeBSD for AArch64.</p>\n<p>I wasn't able to test FreeBSD directly but cg_clif builds and passes its tests with this commit applied to the v3.0.0 tag.
