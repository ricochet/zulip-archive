Most of this can be understood by Rust &amp; Wasmtime experts, but that's not necessarily who's always reading the documentation. I would instead perhaps recommend a style where we explain why the mutable context is used here and some benefits of that, but I wouldn't go into many details of \"if we did this other thing it would have these implications\".</p>\n<p>Basically I don't want to draw too too much attention to this design decision because it's relatively minor compared to the rest of Wasmtime, and while it's important to be aware of it it's not necessarily too useful I think to consider what alternate implementation strategies were rejected when thinking about this. (tbh I never even considered using a lock or a cell, the mutability here just seemed natural)</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think most people would expect that getting an export is just reading a field or doing a hash map lookup.</p>\n<p>Otherwise good points.</p>\n</blockquote>",
