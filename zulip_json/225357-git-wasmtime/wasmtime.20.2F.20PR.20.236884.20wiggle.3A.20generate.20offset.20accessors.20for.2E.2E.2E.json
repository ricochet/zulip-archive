I don't believe there is currently a way to get these otherwise for applications that wish to selectively read and write to fields.</p>\n<p>I considered a couple alternatives to this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Add methods like <code>read_&lt;field_name&gt;</code> and <code>write_&lt;field_name&gt;</code>. The interface to these ends up being awkward because the <code>GuestType</code> impls are currently for owned types, so these methods would be forced to either take ownership of the entire struct to write one field, or else silently clone the field.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add <code>#[repr(C)]</code> to the generated struct definition so that clients could use tools like <code>memoffset</code> to calculate the offset themselves. I didn't want to depend on the witx offsets coinciding with <code>repr(C)</code>, though.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I extended the Wiggle <code>records</code> to exercise these new methods.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
