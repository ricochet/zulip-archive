I've not been able to do so successfully, so as a result I (somewhat embarrassingly) don't currently have a working <code>perf</code> command on my machine. Because wasmtime's guest profiler doesn't interact with the kernel at all, this seems like the ideal way to resolve it, basically by providing a portable, OS-agnostic profiling suite.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>There is a working guest profiler available already, but trying to run it on components gives the following error message:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Text only\"><pre><span></span><code>Error: Cannot use the guest profiler with components\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I don't really have insight in what it would take to implement support for components. But I figured it would be desirable - and I didn't see it being tracked already, so I figured we should. Folks with more knowledge about the challenges here should probably chime in though.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
