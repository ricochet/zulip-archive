This code is guarded by a check for vector instructions and so afaik neither Opcode::FcvtToUint or Opcode::FcvtToSint are supported for vector input. In the context of a vector instruction it currently impossible to reach this branch with those opcodes right? This question has come up before where I reach for using unreachable instead of implementing it as unimplemented. I can change to unimplemented but not really sure the rules for applying unimplemented vs unreachable when context is considered. Certainly support for vector input for Opcode::FcvtToUint or Opcode::FcvtToSint could be added, but then that is the case for most places in the backend were the unreachable! is used instead of unimplemented! For example there are places where we match on a type (pshufd use in extractlane for example) and say the default _ =&gt; is unreachable simply because a type is not supported, but if there was need for that support and that support were added it is suddenly unimplemented and not unreachable.</p>\n</blockquote>",

That information is available in <code>EmitInfo.isa_flags</code> but unfortunately that struct is not present until the emit phase. If we created a new <code>Inst::XmmLowBits { dst, bits_to_retain }</code> (or something like that) and lowered to that then in the emit phase we could pick which version we want based on the <code>EmitInfo</code>. The other option would be to try to make those ISA flags available during lowering but that seems harder to do (@cfallin?).</p>\n</blockquote>",
