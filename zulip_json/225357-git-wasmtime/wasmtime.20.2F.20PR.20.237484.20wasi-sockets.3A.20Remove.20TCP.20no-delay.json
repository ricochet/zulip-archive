I don't expect there to be anything insurmountable. Its just that I haven't had the time to do so yet and I can't promise to have it done before the stabilization Preview2.</p>\n<p>So, in order to get wasi-sockets ready for Preview2, it was discussed to temporarily remove <code>no-delay</code> and reevaluate its inclusion before Preview3.</p>\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7013\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7013</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
