Unsure.</p>\n<p>I guess we could punt that saturate-or-not decision to the embedder since they can check <code>fuel_consumed</code> and compare it to the fuel added to clamp the amount of fuel to consume when calling this method. Might make sense to have a <code>fuel_remaining</code> method so they don't have to remember how much fuel was added and do that comparison themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The precise interfaces here aren't exhasutively considered and bike-shedded, rather they're mostly just situation-solving feature requests as we get them. For now I figured you could get <code>fuel_remaining</code> with <code>consume_fuel(0)</code>, but we can always add another path if necessary in the future too.</p>\n</blockquote>",
