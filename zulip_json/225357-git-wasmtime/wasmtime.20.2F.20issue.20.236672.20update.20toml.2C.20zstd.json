Keeping dependencies up to date is a good idea. I'm curious though: What prompted you to update these specific dependencies?</p>\n<p>We'll need to evaluate the <code>cargo vet</code> changes separately from the actual dependency updates here. We've generally been having a core-team member merge any changes to <code>supply-chain/</code> first, and then asking contributors to rebase on top. In this case, we need to take some time to evaluate whether we want to trust the same publishers that Mozilla does.</p>\n<p>I'll bring this up at tomorrow's Wasmtime meeting, and try to get consensus soon so we can merge the rest of your PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",
