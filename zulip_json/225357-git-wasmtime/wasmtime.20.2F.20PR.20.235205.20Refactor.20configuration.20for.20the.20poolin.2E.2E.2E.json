I plan on adding a few more configuration options in the near future and the current structure was feeling unwieldy for adding these new abstractions.</p>\n<p>The previous <code>struct</code>-based API has been replaced with a builder-style API in a similar shape as to <code>Config</code>. This is done to help make it easier to add more configuration options in the future through adding more methods as opposed to adding more field which could break prior initializations.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
