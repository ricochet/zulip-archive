The test runner translates the WAT to Wasm and then uses <code>cranelift-wasm</code> to translate the Wasm to CLIF.</p>\n<p>These tests are always precise output tests. The test expectations can be updated by running tests with the <code>CRANELIFT_TEST_BLESS=1</code> environment variable set, similar to our compile precise output tests. The test's expected output is contained in the last comment in the test file.</p>\n<p>The tests allow for configuring the kinds of heaps used to implement Wasm linear memory via TOML in a <code>;;!</code> comment at the start of the test.</p>\n<p>To get ISA and Cranelift flags parsing available in the filetests crate, I had to move the <code>parse_sets_and_triple</code> helper from the <code>cranelift-tools</code> binary crate to the <code>cranelift-reader</code> crate, where I think it logically fits.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I had to make some more bits of <code>cranelift-wasm</code>'s dummy environment <code>pub</code> so that I could properly wrap and compose it with the environment used for the <code>.wat</code> tests. I don't think this is a big deal, but if we eventually want to clean this stuff up, we can probably remove the dummy environments completely, remove <code>translate_module</code>, and fold them into these new test environments and test runner (since Wasmtime isn't using those things anyways).</p>\n<p>Finally, I haven't ported <code>cranelift/filetests/filetests/wasm/*</code> to this new test format yet. That will happen in a follow up PR. There is just one example test that I used to make sure all the TOML parsing and test expectation updating was working properly.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
