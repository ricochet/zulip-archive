It can only exist as an SSA value, and can't be directly stored in memory. It can, however, be converted into an integer with value 0 or 1 by the bint instruction (and converted back with icmp_imm with 0).<br>\nSeveral larger boolean types are also defined, primarily to be used as SIMD element types. They can be stored in memory, and are represented as either all zero bits or all one bits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've had some conversations about this with @sunfishcode and @cfallin in the past--I'll let them comment here. FWIW, I think the approach in ecb72cc of storing a 0 or a 1 to represent a boolean is fine.</p>\n</blockquote>",

A few points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wider bool types are indeed stored as all-ones or all-zeroes, as they're meant to serve as bitmasks.</li>\n<li>For <code>b1</code>, as @abrown notes above, they're not supposed to be stored/loaded from within CLIF, semantically. On all three  of x64, aarch64, s390x, we AND out the LSB to implement <code>bint</code>, following the usual \"upper bits are undefined\" invariant.</li>\n<li>But because we are writing runtime-internal code, we can reason about the combination of our runtime-side stores and generated-code loads; we aren't restricted by \"don't load/store <code>b1</code>\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we are going to do the fully generic thing for bools of all widths, the proper approach I think is to write all-ones (<code>-1i128 as u128</code>) to the <code>u128</code> slot, then a load of any width will pick up all-ones. So I think this patch is <em>almost</em> there, except for the constant value.</p>\n</blockquote>",
