Strangely, the <code>ORR</code> (which is what <code>MOV</code> aliases to in this case) latency is also 1, but I have decided to be conservative and have made the change. That's the only difference I have found.</p>\n<p>Personally, I have been trying to use the term <code>Fpu</code> in VCode names to refer to SIMD &amp; FP scalars, while <code>Vec</code> (e.g. <code>Inst::VecMisc</code>) - to vectors (and yes, there are 128-bit \"scalars\", though that subtlety pertains mostly to loads, and then to big-endian environments). With that in mind <code>FMOV</code> is better, but ultimately it is the same operation.</p>\n</blockquote>",
