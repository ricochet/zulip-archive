An isntruction will not be \"hoisted\" to a point where it could execute in the optimized code but not in the original.</p>\n<p>However, there are really two parts to the egraph implementation that produce this effect: the deduplication on insertion into the egraph, and the elaboration with a scoped hashmap. The deduplication lets us give a single name (value ID) to all copies of an identical instruction, and then elaboration will re-create duplicates if GVN should not hoist or merge some of them.</p>\n<p>Because deduplication need not worry about dominance or scopes, we use a simple (non-scoped) hashmap to dedup/intern ops as \"egraph nodes\".</p>\n<p>When we added support for GVN'ing effectful but idempotent ops (#5594), we kept the use of this simple dedup'ing hashmap, but these ops do not get elaborated; instead they stay in the side-effecting skeleton. Thus, we inadvertently created potential for weird code-motion effects.</p>\n<p>The proposal in #5796 would solve this in a clean way by treating these ops as pure again, and keeping them out of the skeleton, instead putting \"force\" pseudo-ops in the skeleton. However, this is a little more complex than I would like, and I've realized that @jameysharp's earlier suggestion is much simpler: we can keep an actual scoped hashmap separately just for the effectful-but-idempotent ops, and use it to GVN while we build the egraph. In effect, we're fusing a separate GVN pass with the egraph pass (but letting it interact corecursively with egraph rewrites. This is in principle similar to how we keep a separate map for loads and fuse this pass with the egraph rewrite pass as well.</p>\n<p>Note that we can use a <code>ScopedHashMap</code> here without the \"context\" (as needed by <code>CtxHashMap</code>) because, as noted by @jameysharp, in practice the ops we want to GVN have all their args inline. Equality on the <code>InstructinoData</code> itself is conservative: two insts whose struct contents compare shallowly equal are definitely identical, but identical insts in a deep-equality sense may not compare shallowly equal, due to list indirection. This is fine for GVN, because it is still sound to skip any given GVN opportunity (and keep the original instructions).</p>\n<p>Fixes #5796.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

I suspect all the instructions currently classed as <code>is_mergeable_for_egraph</code> have their type fully determined by their operands, so I think this isn't strictly necessary today. But it does seem like a good idea to do it just in case, and also it's consistent with the key type for the pure GVN map.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure there's any action necessary here, just noting something that confused me for a minute.</p>\n</blockquote>",
