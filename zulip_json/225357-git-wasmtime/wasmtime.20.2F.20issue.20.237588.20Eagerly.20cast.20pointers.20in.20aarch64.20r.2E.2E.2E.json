These variables are almost always cast to <code>usize</code> or <code>isize</code> before they're used, so perhaps we should instead turn the base pointer into its target numeric type eagerly, to avoid needing the <code>unsafe</code> blocks for calling the <code>offset</code> method on the pointers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/cd97c9f14713d81de5453fb9861319e78a761432/cranelift/jit/src/compiled_blob.rs#L55-L57\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/cd97c9f14713d81de5453fb9861319e78a761432/cranelift/jit/src/compiled_blob.rs#L55-L57</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
