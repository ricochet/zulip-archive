I see several use cases for this:</p>\n<h2>Use cases</h2>\n<h4>Convenience for complex checks</h4>\n<p>Some checks are easy to express in code but complicated to express as blocks of IP addresses. For example, allowing only non-private IP v4 network traffic is trivial as a predicate function but really difficult as a collection of CIDR blocks: </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">ctx</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">dynamic_socket_addr_check</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">match</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">ip</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">IpAddr</span>::<span class=\"n\">V4</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">!</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">is_private</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span>\n<span class=\"w\">   </span><span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kc\">false</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Dynamic checks that change over time</h4>\n<p>Typically the <code>Pool</code> of IP addresses that are supported is instantiated before any component is run. This means that more dynamic use cases are either not possible or much hard to achieve. For example, allowing the environment to control some aspects of what IP addresses are allowed:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">ctx</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">dynamic_socket_addr_check</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">if</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">Ok</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">std</span>::<span class=\"n\">env</span>::<span class=\"n\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"ALLOW_LOOPBACK\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"w\">       </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">ip</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"n\">is_loopback</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">      </span><span class=\"kc\">false</span>\n<span class=\"w\">   </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Concerns</h2>\n<h4>Supporting directly in <code>Pool</code></h4>\n<p>I agree that adding this support to <code>Pool</code> might make more sense but how exactly to do that does not seem super straight forward. Since the only user facing change here is the <code>dynamic_socket_addr_check</code>, we could potentially punt on adding this to <code>Pool</code> if we're happy with the user facing API.</p>\n<h4>Multiple Calls</h4>\n<p>I agree, it's a bit strange that calling this function multiple times overrides the previous calls. There is some precdent of this already in that <code>WasiCtx::inherit_network</code> sort of overrides previous invocations though one could argue that it doesn't invalidate them, it just makes them redundant. Would storing these callbacks in a <code>Vec</code> or <code>SmallVec</code> make sense and be worth the cost of potentially more allocation?</p>\n<h4>Behavior of <code>false</code></h4>\n<p>I understand that <code>false</code> meaning \"do other checks\" isn't the most intuitive. It does make sense if the predicate is thought of only as \"are we allowing this traffic\" vs \"are we allowing <em>or</em> denying this traffic\". The status quo is the former of these two options and mirrors the behavior of <code>Pool</code> (i.e., adding an IP range to <code>Pool</code> does not mean that if an IP falls out of that range, the traffic will be denied. There may be some other range that allows that IP.). </p>\n<p>We could work around this completely by changing the closure to return a return type that is a bit more explicit:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">enum</span> <span class=\"nc\">IpCheck</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"c1\">// This is the equivalent of returning `true` in current scheme</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">Allow</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"c1\">// Being able to deny explicitly in these dynamic checks is new</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">Deny</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"c1\">// This is the equivalent of returning `false` in current scheme</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">Passthrough</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This makes these more explicit at the cost of ultimately be more complicated (each closure has three possible outcomes as opposed to two). </p>\n</blockquote>",

I already ran into the limitations of <code>Pool</code> and <code>PoolExt</code> multiple times myself. Which is (one of) the reasons why the current implementation ended up using rustix' <code>connect</code> and tokio's <code>send</code> &amp; <code>recv</code> directly, instead of going through cap-std's <code>connect_existing_udp_socket</code> &amp; <code>send_to_udp_socket_addr</code>.</p>\n<p>At the same time, this change throws every address on one big pile (called <code>check</code>) and looses the context in which the address is about to be used. Eg. inbound vs outbound, local vs remote, etc. Not a big problem for now, but maybe this could be extended in the future with <code>check_for_tcp_bind</code>, <code>check_for_tcp_connect</code>, <code>check_for_udp_send</code>, ..</p>\n</blockquote>",

In practice, it seems it's been more straightforward to just implement the logic in Wasmtime rather than to modify <code>Pool</code>.
