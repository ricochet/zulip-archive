Now wasm-smith generated modules we're using for differential fuzzing here should manually be canonicalizing NaN at the wasm level so Cranelift doesn't need to do it.</p>\n<p>The initial, misguided, attempt for this is at <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3190\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3190</a> but as pointed out there it's far more robust to do canonicalization <em>somewhere</em>, and for differential fuzzing it's easiest if it's done at the wasm level so we don't have to implement canonicalization differently in all engines.</p>\n</blockquote>",
