Turns out they are needed for Cranelift's Pulley backend to allow for lowering certain address modes to a single instruction. The alternative, lowering the address modes to a sequence of instructions, would be a bit annoying and these instructions seem generally useful.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Right now some of the <code>offset</code>-to-<code>isize</code> conversions are <code>.into()</code> and some are <code>as isize</code> which is a small hiccup, but probably inconsequential.
