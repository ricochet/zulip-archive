Previously there<br>\nwere a few sprinkled blocks that used <code>if</code> to generate different<br>\ninstructions inline, but as I've worked on support for strings this has<br>\nbecome pretty unwieldy as strings do far more memory manipulation than<br>\nother type conversions. A pattern that's easier to read is to have<br>\nsmall instruction helpers that take the pointer width as an argument and<br>\ninternally dispatch to the correct instruction. This keeps the main<br>\ntranslation code branch-free and a bit easier to follow. Additionally<br>\nfor more complicated branching logic it allows for deduplicating the<br>\nmain translation path by having lots of little branches instead of one<br>\nlarge branch with everything duplicated on both halves.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
