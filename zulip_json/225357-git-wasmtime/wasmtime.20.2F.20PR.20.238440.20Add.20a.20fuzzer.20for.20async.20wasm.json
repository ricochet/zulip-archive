This work was originally blocked on <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/53891\">llvm/llvm-project#53891</a> and while that's still an issue it now contains a workaround for that issue. Support for async fuzzing required a good deal of refactorings and changes, and the highlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The main part is that new intrinsics, <code>__sanitizer_{start,finish}_fiber_switch</code> are now invoked around the stack-switching routines of fibers. This only works on Unix and is set to only compile when ASAN is enabled (otherwise everything is a noop). This required refactoring of things to get it all in just the right way for ASAN since it appears that these functions not only need to be called but more-or-less need to be adjacent to each other in the code. My guess is that while we're switching ASAN is in a \"weird state\" and it's not ready to run arbitrary code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stacks are a problem. The above issue in LLVM outlines how stacks cannot be deallocated at this time because if the deallocated virtual memory is later used for the heap then ASAN will have a false positive about stack overflow. To handle this stacks are specially handled in asan mode by using a special allocation path that never deallocates stacks. This logic additionally applies to the pooling allocator which uses a different stack allocation strategy with ASAN.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all of the above a new fuzzer is added. This fuzzer generates an arbitrary module, selects an arbitrary means of async (e.g. epochs/fuel), and then tries to execute the exports of the module with various values. In general the fuzzer is looking for crashes/panics as opposed to correct answers as there's no oracle here. This is also intended to stress the code used to switch on and off stacks.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
