Turns out basically every single action we have and reference uses <code>node12</code>, so this updates most of them to versions that use <code>node16</code>. I think we have some bytecodealliace-hosted actions to update as well but this should be the main crop.</p>\n<p>I also updated the mdbook version here since I think the old version no longer compiles on newest rustc.</p>\n</blockquote>",
