Should we be fixing that, though with something like a symlink of <code>libwasmtime.so</code> to <code>libwasmtime-XXXXXX.so</code>? (is that was normal linux distros do?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the caveat that I'm out of my depth here, I poked around on my own box (Fedora 34) and found that a bunch of libraries have files <code>/usr/lib64/libXXX.so.N</code> (e.g., <code>libc.so.6</code>) that are symlinks to <code>libXXX-VERSION.so</code> (e.g., <code>libc-2.33.so</code>).</p>\n<p>However I'm not able to discern how <code>ld</code> finds these -- a <code>gcc --verbose</code> shows just a <code>-lc</code> on the commandline to <code>collect2</code> (which invokes the linker), but if I pick another random library on my system and try to add a <code>-l</code> option for it (e.g. <code>-ljson-c</code> for <code>libjson-c.so.5</code>), this doesn't work; I need to give the full path to the <code>.so</code>.</p>\n<p>@MartinKolbAtWork perhaps you can help us out here -- would it be idiomatic to use a git-hash as a version, and if so, how might we make this work in a way that allows <code>-lwasmtime</code> to still do the right thing?</p>\n</blockquote>",

This container contains the application along with the exact version of the shared libraries that are needed to run the application. There’s no longer a large Linux server that applications are installed on, where we need to consider other/older versions of the same library to be present.</p>\n<p>My <strong>main goal is to make the simplest use-case very simple</strong>. The simplest use-case is that I use a shared library like “libwasmtime.so”, and I don’t care about versioning, I just use my current built/downloaded version of “libwasmtime.so” and link and package it with an application.<br>\nFor that use-case (which is IMHO probably the 99% use-case) and <strong>unversioned file-name like “libwasmtime.so” and an unversioned SONAME with “libwasmtime.so” will do a perfect job</strong>.</p>\n<p>My center of expertise is C/C++, and when @alexcrichton asked me for a PR I did my best to provide a solution that fits into the Rust universe. I saw that Wasmtime already used “build.rs” files at some places, so I simply picked that approach. I know that the <strong>same can be achieved via linker settings in “rustflags”</strong> of “.cargo/config/toml”. Another approach is using <strong>creates like “cargo-c”</strong>. As my experience in Rust is far from being an expert, I leave the <strong>final decision</strong> on how to solve this <strong>to experts</strong> like @alexcrichton .</p>\n<p>I added another commit to my PR, fixing some “cargo fmt” issues that I introduced with my explanatory comments.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br>\nLet’s <strong>fix the simple things</strong> that helps consumers of “libwasmtime.so” in the C/C++ realm: Provide an <strong>unversioned filename and SONAME: “libwasmtime.so”</strong><br>\n<strong>Refrain from tackling the versioning aspect</strong>, because it makes even simple things more complex, and is of limited use (especially in today’s container world)</p>\n<p>Thanks, Martin<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

As a proper versioning and guaranty of API compatibility adds complexity, I understand that this PR may be a simpler \"fix\".</p>\n<p>Regarding Fedora packaging of Wasmtime (which has to deal with ABI versioning, as any other Linux distribution), I think I'll use cargo-c, which is handy for C-ABI compatible libraries (BTW, cargo-c should support <a href=\"https://github.com/lu-zero/cargo-c/issues/184#issuecomment-866099540\">in the near future</a> multiple pre-generated header files as used by Wasmtime).</p>\n<p>I've found out that the SONAME set in <code>build.rs</code> with this PR overrides the SONAME set by cargo-c, so I'll have to patch Wasmtime in Fedora to remove the unversioned SONAME (but this is not blocker).</p>\n</blockquote>",
