Our<br>\nimplementation, however, does not guarantee that you'll get the same<br>\n<code>wasm_ref_t*</code> for each actual underlying item (e.g. if you put a func in<br>\na table and then get the func as an export and from the table then<br>\n<code>same</code> will report <code>false</code>). Additionally the fate of <code>wasm_ref_t*</code><br>\nseems somewhat unclear at this point.</p>\n<p>The change here is to make the <code>same</code> and cast functions all abort<br>\nsaying they're unimplemented. (similar to the host info functions). If<br>\nand when we get around to reimplementing these functions we can ensure<br>\nthey're implemented uniformly and work well for all intended use cases.</p>\n</blockquote>",
