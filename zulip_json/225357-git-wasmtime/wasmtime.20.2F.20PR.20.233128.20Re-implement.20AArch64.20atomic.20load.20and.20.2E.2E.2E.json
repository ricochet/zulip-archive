The backend now pattern matches uextend(atomic_load) too.</p>\n<p>The fallback CAS loops and RMW, for AArch64, have also been updated<br>\nto use acquire-release, exclusive, instructions which, again, remove<br>\nthe need for barriers. The CAS loop has also been further optimised<br>\nby using the extending form of the cmp instruction.</p>\n<p>Copyright (c) 2021, Arm Limited.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
