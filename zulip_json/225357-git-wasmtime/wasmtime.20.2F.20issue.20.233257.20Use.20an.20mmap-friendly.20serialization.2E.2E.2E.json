Historically we switched to variable-length integer encoding to get &gt;33% size wins on the resulting compiled artifact, so I want to be careful not to lose that. We've got far less data going through <code>bincode</code> now and <code>bincode</code> represents a much smaller portion of the final binary. The good news, though, is that for a large module I'm looking at we're actually remaining steady at the same size of the final compiled artifact.  That means that we shouldn't be inflating artifacts with a new format unnecessarily.</p>\n</blockquote>",
