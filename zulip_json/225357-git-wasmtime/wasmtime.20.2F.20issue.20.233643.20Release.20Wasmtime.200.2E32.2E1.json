I'm thinking now though that despite this being probably too late to be a meaningful patch release I'd like to go ahead and push forward with it because it can exercise the workflows we have. For example this won't actually release anything unless <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3644\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3644</a> is merged. I'll prep that backport once it's ready.</p>\n<p>@cfallin would you be up for updating <code>RELEASES.md</code> here? I'm not actually sure the best process for that. In theory we want <code>RELEASES.md</code> updated on the <code>main</code> branch as well, so perhaps a PR against <code>main</code> which is cherry-picked onto this PR as well?</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'll do a quick PR to update that, and another to update the releases list on the main branch.</p>\n</blockquote>",
