I'm not yet sure whether that's something you'd want so restrained myself for now but it would be possible too, though I'm not really sure what <code>PendingPreopen</code> actually brings in practice compared to just opening ahead-of-time (and thus seeing potential errors happen as soon as possible)</p>\n</blockquote>",

Sorry I missed your message on the bytecode alliance discord.</p>\n<p>Your use case is important to me. I'm nearing completion of a complete rewrite of wasi-common that, among other things, redesigns the traits so that files and directories have distinct sets of methods. <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2487\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2487</a> I expect this PR will land within a week or so. (When it is ready to land, i'll rename the wasi-c2 crate back to wasi-common, thats just a name under development.)</p>\n<p>The new design of the ctx builder should support your use case possible - <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/pch/wasi_common_cap_std/crates/wasi-c2/src/ctx.rs#L104\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/pch/wasi_common_cap_std/crates/wasi-c2/src/ctx.rs#L104</a></p>\n<p>Is it OK to close this PR and you can re-target your work at the rewritten wasi-common?</p>\n</blockquote>",
