However when fixing that, I added a verifier rule, and it turns out we have a <strong>lot</strong> of 0 sized <code>heap_addr</code>'s in our test suite. Are these legal?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-codegen/latest/cranelift_codegen/ir/trait.InstBuilder.html#method.heap_addr\">instruction docs</a> state the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Verify that the offset range <code>p .. p + Size - 1</code> is in bounds for the heap H, and generate an absolute address that is safe to dereference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it sounds like <code>Size</code> must always be larger than 1?</p>\n<p>But it also says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If <code>p + Size</code> is not greater than the heap bound</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which would allow 0 as a <code>Size</code>.</p>\n<p>So, lets make a decision about this! I don't have any preference for either, I'm just opening this as a PR because when I started fixing the interpreter I thought it would just be that one runtest that was wrong!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Also, there are some regressions in the x64 codegen that probably shouldn't be there.</p>\n</blockquote>",
