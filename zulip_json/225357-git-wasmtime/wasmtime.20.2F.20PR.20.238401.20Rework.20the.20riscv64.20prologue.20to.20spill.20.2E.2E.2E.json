This change should preserve the locations on the stack where the clobbers are written, so no changes were necessary for the epilogue.<br>\n&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",

A signal handler could run on our stack at any time and is allowed to overwrite anything outside our reserved portion of the stack. Some architectures provide a small \"red zone\" where we could get away with this, but we shouldn't rely on that.</p>\n<p>For the same reason, the epilogue should also be updated to not adjust the stack pointer until it has already restored all the clobbers.</p>\n<p>Would you update the commit message and PR description to mention this bug fix?</p>\n</blockquote>",
