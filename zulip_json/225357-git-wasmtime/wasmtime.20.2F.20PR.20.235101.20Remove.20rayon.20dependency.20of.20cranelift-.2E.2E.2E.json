The total unparallelized time the code that uses rayon takes is less than half a second and it runs at compile time, so there is pretty much no benefit to parallelizing it.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4906/files#r1002697557\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4906/files#r1002697557</a>. I think I'm going to revert back to Cranelift 0.88.1 until this is merged.</p>\n</blockquote>",
