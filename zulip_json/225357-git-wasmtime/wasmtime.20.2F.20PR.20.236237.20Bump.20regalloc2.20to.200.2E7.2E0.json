We insert a copy of the ref-typed values before calling a function with them as an argument, as the values themselves will be constrained to live on the stack.<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/e6339b27254d9e9c4c2fe7bdf1a3a06589c74847/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/abi.rs#L2243-L2253\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/e6339b27254d9e9c4c2fe7bdf1a3a06589c74847/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/abi.rs#L2243-L2253</a><br>\nWith program moves no longer being special for RA2, the move that's inserted by cranelift on line 95 doesn't end up being redundant with the one that RA2 inserts. The store to the stack can use that value without any issue, however we still need to copy the value back to <code>x0</code> to pass as the first argument to <code>fn0</code>. Supporting overlap in RA2 will help a lot here, as the value will be allowed to exist on the stack and in a register at the same time, giving us a path forward for skipping the initial copy when setting up the arg.</p>\n</blockquote>",
