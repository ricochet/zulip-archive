An effect of this change is that the only place that the virtual sp offset was meaningfully changed was in the function prologue, where it was always updated by the constant amount required for the outgoing arguments area. As the only other place that the virtual sp offset was modified was in the handling for call instructions to functions that used the tail-call abi, the need for the virtual sp offset is no longer obvious.</p>\n<p>This PR removes the virtual sp offset from all backends, and instead maintains the invariant that SP always points to the end of the stack frame, right after the outgoing arguments area. This does require the call pseudo-instruction to decrement SP after a call to a tail-call function, as those free their incoming argument area, but I believe this change to be a benefit, as we now no longer directly manipulate SP outside of the function prologue and epilogue.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
