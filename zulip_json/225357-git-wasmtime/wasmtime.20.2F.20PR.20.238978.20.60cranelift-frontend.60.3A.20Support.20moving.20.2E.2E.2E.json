We now keep every GC value in a stack slot, spill to the stack slot on the value's definition, and reload from the stack slot on every use. This means that we can generate a bunch of redundant loads, but we let the mid-end's alias analysis clean that up. This has the added benefit of reducing the length of live ranges for GC values and also means we don't need to proactively spill every single live GC values at each safepoint, because we know they are already spilled. This latter bit actually helps us avoid an accidentally quadratic issue with many, long, overlapping live ranges where we would do <code>O(n^2)</code> spills for a series of safepoints that keep creating more GC refs.</p>\n<p>We also implement two further optimizations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We lazily allocate slots for live GC values, which means that if a GC value is not ever live across a safepoint, then we do never allocate a stack slot for it and never spill it to the stack slot. If we didn't do this, then frames would be larger and we'd have a dead store to the stack slot that would otherwise require the mid-end to grow a dead-store-elimination pass.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We keep a free list of available slots that will never be used again, and we reuse slots from here when possible. This means that a chain of non-overlapping live ranges, each of which still needs to appear in some safepoint's stack map, will all reuse the same stack slot, keeping frames from being bloated.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, this commit also introduces some logs for the liveness analysis to ease future debugging.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

First, we aren't <em>just</em> dealing with wasm locals, which are <code>Variable</code>s; we are also dealing with the results of calls and things like that, which produce <code>Value</code>s. So we have to have a solution for <code>Value</code>s either way. Second, <code>cranelift-wasm</code> doesn't make the decision whether certain types are managed by the GC or not, it is agnostic of runtime structures and implementation, <code>wasmtime-cranelift</code> makes those decisions based on its Wasmtime-specific knowledge. That means that <code>cranelift-wasm</code> would have to have some kind of <code>enum</code> of either a GC-managed <code>Variable</code> (or other new entity) or a plain <code>Value</code> and use that for its abstract operand stack, at which point the whole crate, essentially, is infected with this change and things are getting really hairy.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we decided it was better, at least for now, to play nice with the existing system and its existing entities, rather than overhaul everything.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think that might point the way to an implementation solution that also avoids the need for the extra pass: branch in the variable-to-SSA-value translation to an alternate \"value just lives on stack\" path.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately this won't work because the stack slots and liveness and all that are not created until we are finishing the function builder, long after calls to <code>builder.use_var</code>.</p>\n<p>Trevor and I talked about another solution for this specific problem though: if we maintain a backwards map from <code>Value</code> to the <code>Variable</code> that it is associated with (if any) then we can force all <code>Value</code>s for the same <code>Variable</code> to use the same stack slot. For <code>Value</code>s that are not associated with a <code>Variable</code>, they would use the same approach we have in this PR. But this is work for the future.</p>\n</blockquote>",
