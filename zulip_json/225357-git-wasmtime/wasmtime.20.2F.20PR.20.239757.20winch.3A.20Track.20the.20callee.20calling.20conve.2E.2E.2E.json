Even though the calling convention invariants are correctly handled early on in the code generation process and this has no effect on the generated code, it could lead to subtle bugs if Cranelift's emission infrastructure changes. It could also be confusing when trying to implement call instrutions for other backends.</p>\n<p>This change is motivated by some of the questions in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9751\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9751</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
