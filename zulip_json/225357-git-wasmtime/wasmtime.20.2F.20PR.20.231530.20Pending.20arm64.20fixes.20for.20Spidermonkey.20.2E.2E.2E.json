Then the safety argument is a completely local property of the machine-independent lowering code that calls us: it knows that it's generating the copy into the retval just before the epilogue, and so can break its usual \"SSA value's register is only writable at SSA def point\" invariant (or if it does something different, allocate a writable temp to use here).</p>\n</blockquote>",

(On preview of the rest of the patch below, it already led to a lot of boilerplate churn.) Reading the generated code, it looks like it's currently a <code>[u8; 7]</code> (so the pointer is larger than the flags array itself!). In general, with a bit per flag, I wouldn't expect it to grow beyond a few words, for a while anyway. Could we just clone it instead?</p>\n</blockquote>",
