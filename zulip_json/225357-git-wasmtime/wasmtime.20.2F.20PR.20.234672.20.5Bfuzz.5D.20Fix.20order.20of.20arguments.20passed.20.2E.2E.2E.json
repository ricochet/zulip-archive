This change fixes #4671 and adds an<br>\nadditional unit test to keep it fixed.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

When I cut a new version of my interpreter, I can investigate if it makes sense to push the reversal down further, but an advantage of doing it this way is that the <code>rev</code> and <code>map</code> operations can be carried out simultaneously, which is more efficient.</p>\n</blockquote>",
