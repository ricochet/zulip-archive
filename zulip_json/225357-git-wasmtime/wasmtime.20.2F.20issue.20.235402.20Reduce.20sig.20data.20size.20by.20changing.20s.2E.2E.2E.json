Hooray! You should now assert that the size is 24 bytes.</p>\n<p>The other CI failures look like they might be temporary network errors, not an issue with your changes. Maybe by the time you push a fix for the <code>sig_data_size</code> test, the other tests will pass again. If not, we'll have to look more closely at what's going wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>",
