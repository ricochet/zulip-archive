There are two reasons for this change:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The type set will already be empty, as <code>I128</code> is the largest integer type we support</li>\n<li><code>BitSet8::from_range</code> will panic if the lower bound is <code>&gt;= 8</code>, as this would cause the shift it uses to compute the lower bound value to overflow the <code>u8</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The only situation that would produce this problem would be a situation where the constraint was already invalid (like <code>uextend.i128</code> of a value that's already an <code>I128</code>) so this shouldn't be triggered by any already valid uses of cranelift. Additionally, this shouldn't be triggered by any existing fuzzing, as we're trying not to generate programs that would fail validation.</p>\n<p>I discovered this bug while running #5947 locally, which uses the operand constraints to generate instruction instantiations, and as such came up with a bad one for <code>uextend</code>.<br>\n&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
