The original<br>\nmessage reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now that <code>SyntheticAmode</code> can refer to constants, there is no longer a<br>\nneed for a separate instruction format--standard load instructions will<br>\nwork.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since then, the transition to ISLE and the use of <code>XmmLoadConst</code> in many<br>\nmore places makes this change a larger diff than the original. The basic<br>\nidea is the same, though: the extra indirection of <code>Inst::XMmLoadConst</code><br>\nis removed and replaced by a direct use of <code>VCodeConstant</code> as a<br>\n<code>SyntheticAmode</code>. This has no effect on codegen, but the CLIF output is<br>\nnow clearer in that the actual instruction is displayed (e.g., <code>movdqu</code>)<br>\ninstead of a made-up instruction (<code>load_const</code>).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
