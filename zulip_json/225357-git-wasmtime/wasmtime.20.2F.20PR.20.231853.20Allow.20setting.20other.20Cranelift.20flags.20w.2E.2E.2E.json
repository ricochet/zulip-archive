It seems like it's possible that it would be pretty easy to accidentally break safe invariants through arbitrary flags here.</p>\n<p>Additionally could this document that it's not necesarily the most stable method in the world? Basically just say that flags are intended to come and go over time, and stability is primarily through the other <code>Config</code> methods.</p>\n</blockquote>",
