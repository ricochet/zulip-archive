Jump tables factor into unreachability in<br>\nan expected way: even if a block is listed in a jump table, the block<br>\nmight be unreachable if the jump table itself is unused (or used in an<br>\nunreachable block). Unfortunately, the verifier still expects all<br>\nblock refs in all jump tables to be valid, even after DCE, which will<br>\nnot always be the case.</p>\n<p>This makes a simple change to the pass: after removing blocks, it scans<br>\njump tables. Any jump table that refers to an unreachable block must<br>\nitself be unused, and so we just clear its entries. We do not bother<br>\nremoving it (and renumbering all later jumptables), and we do not bother<br>\ncomputing full unused-ness of all jumptables, as that would be more<br>\nexpensive; it's sufficient to clear out the ones that refer to<br>\nunreachable blocks, which are a subset of all unused jumptables.</p>\n<p>Fixes #2670.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
