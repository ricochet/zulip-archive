Any APIs defined in 0.2.0 but imported at 0.2.1 should still be possible to run on a runtime that only supports 0.2.0.

I'd like to highlight the crucial aspects of backward and forward compatibility with the WASI 0.2 release:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Backward Compatibility</strong>: new runtime supporting 0.2.1 APIs should run components targeting 0.2.0 APIs</li>\n<li><strong>Forward Compatibility</strong>: old runtime supporting 0.2.0 APIs should run components targeting 0.2.1 APIs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For <strong>backward compatibility</strong>, it's essential that any modifications to 0.2.1 API signatures or types are implemented in a way that allows the runtime to ignore these changes when executing components targeting 0.2.0.</p>\n<p>For <strong>forward compatibility</strong>, I interpret what you said as as long as the component's using the interfaces / functions / types defined in 0.2.0, they should be able to run on runtimes with 0.2.0 APIs. However, there's no assurance for components targeting newly introduced or altered 0.2.1 APIs.</p>\n<p>Is there a plan to introduce a polyfill or similar solution to ensure full <strong>forward compatibility</strong> when WASI 0.2.1 is released, that is - older runtime can run any components targeting 0.2.1 APIs?</p>\n</blockquote>",

I've posted <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7994\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7994</a> now which is an implementation of this issue and, if merged, will ship with Wasmtime 19. That means that Wasmtime 19, which will probably support WASI 0.2.0, will be able to run WASI 0.2.1 when it's released (so long as you don't use any new features). Wasmtime 17 and 18, however, will not have <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7994\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/7994</a> and won't be able to run WASI 0.2.1 since they have strict version matching.</p>\n<p>So on one hand the answer to your question is \"yes this is supported\", but the other hand is \"yes but only if Wasmtime 19+ is used\". </p>\n<p>Given that I wouldn't expect an \"official\" polyfill to come into existence, but that's not to say there shouldn't be one of course!</p>\n</blockquote>",
