This patch:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defines the reference types $R32 / $R64.</li>\n<li>Provides a trap_code_bad_conversion_to_integer helper.</li>\n<li>Provides an avoid_div_traps helper.  This requires passing the<br>\n  generic flags in addition to the ISA-specifc flags into the<br>\n  ISLE lowering context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CC @cfallin </p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
