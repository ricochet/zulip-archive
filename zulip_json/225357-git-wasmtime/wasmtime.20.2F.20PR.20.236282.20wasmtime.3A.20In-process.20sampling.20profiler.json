On the other hand, it can only profile time spent in the WebAssembly guest, not in Wasmtime itself or other host code. Also it can't measure time as precisely as platform-native tools can.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I think there's a lot of work that can be avoided that way.</p>\n<p>I don't think batching up <code>WasmBacktrace</code> objects is going to help much, because just collecting one of those involves looking up which function each PC comes from, along with information like the function name. At that point I'd guess three hash-table lookups per function for interning aren't going to make much difference.</p>\n<p>I'd like to merge this with the current approach, of eagerly consuming the high-level <code>WasmBacktrace</code>, as-is for now. I don't think the public API of <code>GuestProfiler</code> will need to change to support more efficient collection of backtraces, so I think we can iterate on performance improvements afterward without impacting any users.</p>\n<p>I definitely want to improve this over time though. I think eventually we're going to want API changes in <code>fxprof-processed-profile</code> for the highest performance sampling we can do in-process.</p>\n</blockquote>",
