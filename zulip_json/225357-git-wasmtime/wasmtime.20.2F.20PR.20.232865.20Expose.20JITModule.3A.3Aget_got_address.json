This prevents the function from being jitted differently from simultaneous requests arising from different threads.</p>\n<p>No test cases added, because exposing a function obviously doesn't change any behaviour.</p>\n<p>Sorry, I don't know who would be an appropriate reviewer for this.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
