The fix is similar where a variable needs page-aligning where previously it wasn't necessary due to wasm sizes always being page-aligned.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
