I've tagged @fitzgen for reviewing this, and I realize that it's a big ask at a whopping 7kloc change. I'm more than happy of course to pair-review together if you'd like.</p>\n<p>As to the commit history currently the first commit is a bit of a monster, but all the subsequent commits should be a bit more bite-sized and easier to digest. That being said I wouldn't necessarily recommend closely following the history. I've gone back and forth over the history on representations and internals and nothing was ever documented until the end. That means there's a lot of transient state in the history which was removed or not really fully justified until the end. In that sense following the history may be difficult, so I'd recommend keeping that in mind if going commit-by-commit.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm at least not personally aware of inspiration to draw upon, so I've basically staked out a random point in the design space that feels like a local-optimum-ish to me. I don't think this is bad, but I also don't think this is great. I'm sure that the embedding API will change over time as we get more experience with host embeddings, plumbing this through WASI, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>",
