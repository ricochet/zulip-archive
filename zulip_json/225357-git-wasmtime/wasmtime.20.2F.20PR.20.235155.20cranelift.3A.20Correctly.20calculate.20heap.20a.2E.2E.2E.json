Since <code>offset</code> is unsigned and we're apparently assuming the addition can't overflow, that would mean the subtraction can't underflow.</p>\n<p>Related: subtracting 1 from <code>load_size</code> _before_ adding it to <code>offset</code> would avoid overflow if we're accessing valid heap addresses near 2^64. But I assume the interpreter would run out of memory long before growing a heap big enough for that to matter.</p>\n</blockquote>",
