I'm still new to Rust and have zero background on wasm but I saw your tweet and this seemed like a nicely sized issue to take on. There are a few parts not working yet, marked with <code>TODO</code>s and I'm also open to nits about style and whatnot but overall the transition to <code>wasm_encoder</code> was super smooth!  </p>\n</blockquote>",
