I went through various instructions I saw for AArch64 and added corresponding <code>shuffle</code> lowerings where appropriate. These lowerings cover all the lowerings I found in the meshoptimizer repository plus a few more based on various instructions I found while perusing ARM's documentation. Like with x86_64 I've tried to make sure there's a runtest and a precise-output test for each lowering, even if some of them probably overlap with the x86_64 runtests.</p>\n<p>I'll note that many of these lowerings probably won't end up getting used by \"portable\" wasm binaries since some of the shifts here are pretty specific to AArch64 and don't have efficient 1/2 instruction lowerings on x86_64. That being said these are useful to any sort of hypothetical Cranelift-as-an-AArch64-backend-compiler such as rustc_cranelift_codegen since this broadens the spectrum of instructions supported by Cranelift's AArch64 backend.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't feel too strongly about it, so this is fine as-is.</p>\n</blockquote>",
