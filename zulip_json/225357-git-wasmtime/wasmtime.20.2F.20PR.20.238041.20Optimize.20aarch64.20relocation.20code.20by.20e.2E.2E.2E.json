This pull request addresses issue #7588, which highlights the prevalent use of unsafe pointer offsets in the aarch64 relocation code within the cranelift-jit component. The current approach frequently casts these unsafe offsets to usize or isize types, suggesting an opportunity to improve code safety and readability by performing these casts eagerly.  Please feel free to correct any noob mistakes. I'm eager to learn and contribute more effectively!</p>\n</blockquote>",
