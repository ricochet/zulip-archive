As far as I can tell, the principle in the past (e.g. in #1178) was to keep the ABI as simple as possible initially. I'm not opposed to declaring that we achieve full SysV ABI compatibility eventually, but it's a higher bar for sure!</p>\n</blockquote>",

Perhaps we can define this to be the default if we're not in Baldrdash (SpiderMonkey) mode. This would give you the building blocks needed to legalize whatever other ABI (SysV or otherwise) down to CLIF. Does that sound reasonable?</p>\n</blockquote>",
