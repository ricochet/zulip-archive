This matches <code>rustc -V</code> for example which was additionally copied to <code>wasm-tools</code> and mirrored as <code>wasm-tools -V</code>.</p>\n<p>Personally I've found this useful since it can help point to exact commits and additionally quickly get a sense of how old a version is based on its commit date presented.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
