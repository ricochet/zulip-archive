In particular, if a branch has any<br>\narguments (e.g., a conditional branch or br_table), its successors must<br>\nall have only one predecessor, so we can do edge moves at the top of<br>\nsuccessor blocks rather than at the end of this block. Otherwise, moves<br>\nthat semantically must come after the block's last uses (the branch's<br>\nargs) would be placed before it.</p>\n<p>This is almost always the case, because crit-edge splitting ensures that<br>\nif we have more than one succ, all our succs will have only one pred.<br>\nThis is because branch kinds that take arguments (fixed args, not the<br>\nblockparam args) tend to have more than one successor: conditionals and<br>\nbr_tables.</p>\n<p>However, a fuzzbug recently illuminated one corner case I had missed: a<br>\nbr_table can have <em>one</em> successor only, if it has a default target and<br>\nan empty table. In this case, crit-edge splitting will happily skip a<br>\nsplit and assume that we can insert edge moves at the end of the block<br>\nwith the br_table. But this will fail.</p>\n<p>regalloc2 explicitly checks this and bails with a panic, rather than<br>\ncontinue, so no miscompilation is possible; but without this fix, we<br>\nwill get these panics on br_tables with empty tables.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
