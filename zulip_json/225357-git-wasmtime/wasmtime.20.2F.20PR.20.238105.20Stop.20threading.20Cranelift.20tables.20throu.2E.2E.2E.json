The TableIndex is a perfectly good identifier and we can use it in a SecondaryMap if we need to associate additional data with the table, such as a Cranelift Table ID.</p>\n<p>This is a step toward #5532, where we don't want to use Cranelift's table support at all, so the associated data that an implementation needs will be different.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

In this PR it would be fine, since the values in <code>self.tables</code> are <code>Copy</code>, but later I'm going to have to extend it to a full struct that I'd want to return a borrow of. Unfortunately, if you have a <code>fn f(&amp;'_ mut T) -&gt; &amp;'_ T</code>, the shared borrow that's returned acts like a mutable borrow, for reasons I don't entirely understand; the mutability is apparently attached to the lifetime. So I'll have to introduce this pattern later anyway.</p>\n<p>I've also considered eagerly creating all the associated table data so that <code>ensure_table_exists</code> can go away, but that seemed like a larger change I didn't want to think through.</p>\n</blockquote>",
