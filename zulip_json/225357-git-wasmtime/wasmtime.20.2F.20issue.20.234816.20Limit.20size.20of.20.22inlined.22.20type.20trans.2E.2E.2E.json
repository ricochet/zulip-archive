The heuristic implemented in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4640\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4640</a> was that translations of a type which resides in memory always get outlined to a separate function (except for primitives).</p>\n<p>This heuristic implemented in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4640\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4640</a> is not sufficient for preventing exponentially sized modules and it's also somewhat suboptimal by having lots of function calls once things are based in memory (e.g. lists). An example of this is a type of the form:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"wasm\"><pre><span></span><code>(type $v1 (union u64 u64 u64 (; ...

N times ... ;)))\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here the \"size\" of this type is $16^N$ which means that the size of the adapter generated is $16^N$, clearly quite large!

We haven't seen a fuzz-bug which found this case yet but I'm presuming it's inevitable at this point. The fix I would like to implement is to keep track of the size of a type (cumulatively summed from all components) and additionally have some sort of concept for the amount of fuel when generating an adapter function. The fuel would be a form of size-heuristic to avoid the function becoming too large where translating a type would deduct the type size from the fuel. If the type size can't be deducted then an out-of-line function would be called to perform the translation, limiting the size of any one function. For the translation of the above <code>$v16</code> type I'd hope that this would result in 16 ish functions in the adapter module all of size $N$, much smaller than $16^N$</p>\n</blockquote>",
