I could have replaced it with a <code>TryFrom</code> implementation but it wasn't used anywhere important, so I'm just deleting it instead.</p>\n<p>Winch was using that <code>VReg</code>-&gt;<code>RealReg</code> conversion, but only in the implementation of another conversion that was itself unused, so I'm deleting that conversion as well. It's easy to implement correctly (the Winch <code>Reg</code> type is identical to <code>RealReg</code>, so all conversions for the latter are readily available) but as far as I can tell Winch doesn't need to use Cranelift's register wrappers or RA2's virtual register type, so it's simpler to just delete those conversions.</p>\n<p>The riscv64 backend was relying on quirks of the existing conversions between <code>RealReg</code> and <code>VReg</code> when emitting clobber saves and restores. Just using the generic conversions between <code>RealReg</code> and <code>Reg</code> is simpler and works correctly with the rest of these changes.</p>\n<p>cc: @elliottt</p>\n</blockquote>",
