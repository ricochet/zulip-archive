We don't usually do patch releases for <code>wasm-tools</code> because there are too many tools and crates and types and APIs to keep track of whether we had breaking changes or not, which are exactly the same difficulties we would run into here when backporting patches. And if we get this wrong, then we break embedders' compilations, which is a terrible downstream experience.</p>\n<p>I also recognize that staying in sync with wasmtime's parsing is a valid use case, so I'm not sure what to do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Am I overly worried about the semver issues?

In a vacuum I agree it'd make sense to minimize what we promise -- the wasmtime API should be about Wasm execution only -- but as you note, this is motivated by a real issue on the other side, too.</p>\n<p>I think it might be worth thinking about the bugfix case further. If the embedder has the requirement that its wasmparser dependency matches its parsing behavior with Wasmtime's, and if we need to support this requirement, then <em>already</em> wasmparser's behavior is relevant when we think about a wasmtime patch release. So I think this already means that we either need to have the property that backports work with the version of wasmparser matched with the old version of wasmtime, or if not, we do a patch release of wasm-tools. In practice I can't think of any backported bugfixes we've had recently at least that were tied closely to a version of wasmparser; are you aware of any?</p>\n<p>I'm also totally fine with putting this re-export behind a feature. The question still remains whether we follow semver or whether it's a \"semver-exempt\" corner of the API when the feature is on; obviously the former is a nicer experience for any embedder with this requirement.</p>\n<p>Anyway, my personal opinion is that as long as this use-case exists out there, we don't gain much in terms of global simplicity or ease of maintenance by pushing the requirement outside of our own local semver bounds, but I'd be curious what others (@alexcrichton ?) think too!</p>\n</blockquote>",

Again, maybe I'm being paranoid.</p>\n<p>But for the use case of \"I need to use the <em>exact</em> same parser as wasmtime\" then I think it really does make sense to say \"you really get the exact same parser that wasmtime uses, regardless of the versioning that wasmtime is otherwise using\" and that semver opt-out motivates putting this behind a cargo feature, IMO. Taken altogether, that feels like a consistent approach.</p>\n</blockquote>",
