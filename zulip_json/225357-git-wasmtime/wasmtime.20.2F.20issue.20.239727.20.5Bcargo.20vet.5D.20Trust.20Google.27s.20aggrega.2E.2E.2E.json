We should switch to importing that aggregation.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>Switching to the aggregation from our current import of the Fuchsia and Chromium audits would give us more coverage now and in an ongoing manner.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>It's probably as simple as switching the import, but for all I know there might be a need to evaluate some of Google's <a href=\"https://github.com/google/rust-crate-audits?tab=readme-ov-file#auditing-criteria\">custom audit criteria</a> and see how to apply them. (\"For all I know\", because I didn't deeply check whether there's anything new compared to our current imports.)</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Keep things as they are</p>\n</blockquote>",
