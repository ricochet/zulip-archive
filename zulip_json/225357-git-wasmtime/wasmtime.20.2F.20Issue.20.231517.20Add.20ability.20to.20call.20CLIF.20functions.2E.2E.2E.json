FWIW reading this over I think there's actually not a whole lot that we'd share between wasmtime and cranelift. Only a few small loops/etc would be shared, and otherwise it seems like we'd probably bend over backwards too much trying to cater to both use cases. In that sense I'd personally be ok if we just left this duplication in the two?</p>\n</blockquote>",
