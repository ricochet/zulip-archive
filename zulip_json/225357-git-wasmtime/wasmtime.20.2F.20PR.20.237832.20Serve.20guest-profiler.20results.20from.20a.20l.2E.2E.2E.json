In particular, I'm not happy with how many crate dependencies I had to add to the Wasmtime CLI to make this work.</p>\n<p>Currently this PR reflects just enough hacking together of pieces to prove that #7666 is possible, so I'm not looking for review on small details, just the big picture design questions.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I.e., to embed a wasi-http/proxy component that can load the profile from a pre-opened directory and serve it from the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http/blob/main/wit/proxy.wit#L31\">incoming-handler</a>.</p>\n<p>Such a component should be straightforward to run, and, after stripping, be quite small.</p>\n</blockquote>",
