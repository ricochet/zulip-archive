As @cfallin said .. the use of types:: prefix is inconsistent so this does improve on that. As you said it does increase verbosity which I think can sometimes reduce readability when it is too redundant, but maybe this allows ide's and the programming to have to parse and deal with less ambiguity. So pros and cons .. I personally wouldn't mind either way. Interested in what others prefer. </p>\n</blockquote>",
