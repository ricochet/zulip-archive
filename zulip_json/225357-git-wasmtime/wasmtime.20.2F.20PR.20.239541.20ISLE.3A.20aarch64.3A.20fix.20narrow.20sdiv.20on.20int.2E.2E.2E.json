The manual check for <code>intmin</code> in this case in ISLE is to add 1 to the dividend and check for overflow, however, the rule was not previously catching that an 8- or 16-bit <code>intmin - 1</code> does not overflow with a 32-bit ARM instruction. This PR adds a left-shift of the dividend before feeding into the <code>intmin</code> check, such that e.g. 0x00000080 is checked as 0x80000000. A ported version of this has been verified as correct by our prototype.</p>\n<p>Note this adds 1 additional instruction (<code>lsl</code>) in the 8- and 16-bit cases of <code>sdiv</code>. An alternative would be to check against hard-coded constants for those cases, but we think this would require adding a new conditional compare to the <code>aarch64</code> assembler.</p>\n<p>This PR also adds a file test for the new instruction sequence.</p>\n</blockquote>",
