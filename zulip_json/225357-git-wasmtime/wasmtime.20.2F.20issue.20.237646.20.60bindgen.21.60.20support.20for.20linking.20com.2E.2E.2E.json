I am confused by the fn name <code>add_to_linker</code> and it blocks compiler as well. In my case, I want to include WASI support, thus newed a linker from <code>wasmtime::Linker</code>, suppose I can use <code>wasmtime_wasi::add_to_linker()</code> to enable WASI for engine, but I also want to use <code>wasmtime::component</code> to <code>bindgen!</code> my WIT file,  <code>wasmtime::component</code> requires itself linker under <code>wasmtime::component::Linker</code>, althought both <code>wasmtime_wasi</code> and <code>wasmtime::component</code> use the same name <code>add_to_linker</code>, but they accept different linker types. Compiler wouldn't compile this code.</p>\n<p>Rename <code>wasmtime::component::add_to_linker</code> to something else would definitely help, and I also sincely hope that <code>wasmtime::component</code> provides a fn to return a normal <code>wasmtime::Linker</code> instance that can be interacted with other part like <code>wasmtime_wasi</code>. </p>\n<p>BTW: could you please share your insights if you know how to instantiate a wasmtime engine with both <code>wasmtime_wasi</code> and <code>wasmtime::component</code> support?  Really appreciate.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
