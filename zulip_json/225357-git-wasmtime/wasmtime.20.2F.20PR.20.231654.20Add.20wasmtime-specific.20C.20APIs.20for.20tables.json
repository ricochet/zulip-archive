For example error messages are communicated<br>\n  through <code>wasmtime_error_t</code> and out-of-bounds vs load of null can be<br>\n  differentiated in the <code>get</code> API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>APIs take <code>wasm_func_t</code> instead of <code>wasm_ref_t</code>. Given the recent<br>\n  decision to remove subtyping from the anyref proposal it's not clear<br>\n  how the C API for tables will be affected, so for now these APIs are<br>\n  all specialized to only funcref tables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Growth now allows access to the previous size of the table, if<br>\n  desired, which mirrors the <code>table.grow</code> instruction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This was originally motivated by <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go/issues/5\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go/issues/5\">bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go#5</a> where<br>\nthe current APIs we have for working with tables don't quite work. We<br>\ndon't have a great way to take an anyref constructed from a <code>Func</code> and<br>\nget the <code>Func</code> back out, so for now this sidesteps those concerns while<br>\nwe sort out the anyref story.</p>\n<p>It's intended that once the anyref story has settled and the official C<br>\nAPI has updated we'll likely delete these wasmtime-specific APIs or<br>\nimplement them as trivial wrappers around the official ones.</p>\n</blockquote>",
