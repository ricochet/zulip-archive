That change was reverted in #6830 for the 12.0.0 release of Wasmtime and otherwise it's currently slated to get released with the 13.0.0 release of Wasmtime. Discussion at today's Wasmtime meeting concluded that it's best to couple this change with #6925 as a single release rather than spread out across multiple releases. This commit is thus the revert of #6737, although it's a partial revert in that I've kept many of the new tests added to showcase the differences before/after when the change lands.</p>\n<p>This means that Wasmtime 13.0.0 will exhibit the same CLI behavior as 12.0.0 and all prior releases. The 14.0.0 release will have both a new CLI and new argument passing semantics. I'll revert this revert (aka re-land #6737) once the 13.0.0 release branch is created and <code>main</code> becomes 14.0.0.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
