I've left out any test-related changes since we're not testing anything just yet. I've also found that rustc now has <code>target_vendor = \"apple\"</code> to cover both macOS and iOS targets (and presumably other targets like tvOS as well if they get added)</p>\n<p>Closes #7506</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
