It turns out that we enabled these<br>\nin the baseline <code>Flags</code> in #3816, because without that, a ton of other<br>\nthings break: default flags no longer produce a compiler backend that<br>\nworks with default Wasmtime settings. However the logic to set them when<br>\ndetected (via <code>CPUID</code>-using feature-test macros) only does an \"if<br>\ndetected then set bit\" step per feature; the bits are never <em>cleared</em>.<br>\nThis PR fixes that.</p>\n<p>This should be relatively temporary: once we fix #3810, then we can<br>\nremove this hack by making the default <code>Flags</code> state all-zeroes again,<br>\nas a compiler with default flags will again support a default Wasmtime.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
