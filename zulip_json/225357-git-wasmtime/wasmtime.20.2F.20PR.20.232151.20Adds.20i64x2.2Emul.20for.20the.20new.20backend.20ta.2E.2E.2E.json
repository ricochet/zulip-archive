Instead, we need to copy RHS into a temporary, and use that, here. Note the vreg copy might not become a copy machine instruction, since regalloc may coalesce those two vregs.</p>\n<p>Also, <code>rhs</code> is a RegMem, so it can be either a register or memory, and here the <code>to_reg().unwrap()</code> assumes it's in a register. When defining <code>rhs</code>, you need to use <code>input_to_reg</code> and not <code>input_to_reg_mem</code> to reflect that you want it to be in a register.</p>\n</blockquote>",

So we can't use <code>to_reg().unwrap()</code> on the result of an <code>input_to_reg_mem</code> call, because the operand might be in memory, and <code>to_reg()</code> returns <code>None</code> in this case. Instead, you want to use <code>input_to_reg</code>, which will always return a register operand, and create a <code>RegMem::reg(...)</code> operand when you need to use it for an instruction that requires a <code>RegMem</code>. Does it help?</p>\n</blockquote>",

And I see you've renamed this :-). So I am still a little uncertain about the reuse of input registers .. is it at any time to use them as a temporary output? I've reworked the algorithm to factor out that shift and modified some things without using too many temps but it's not clear to me if what I have in this update I am about to push is the optimal usage. </p>\n</blockquote>",

It might be that <code>lhs</code> will get the same physical register as <code>dst</code> (if <code>lhs</code>'s final use is for this instruction), thus this move would clobber <code>lhs</code> before it's used in the next <code>pmuludq</code> instruction. Instead, you'll need to use a temporary in place of <code>dst</code> here and in the next instruction; I think you can reuse <code>rhs_1</code> though, since it's dead at this point. (This might require a final <code>gen_move(dst, rhs_1, ty))</code> after the whole sequence, which is fine too.)</p>\n</blockquote>",
