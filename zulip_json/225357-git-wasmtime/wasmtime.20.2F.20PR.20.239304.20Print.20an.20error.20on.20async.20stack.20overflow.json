This is distinct from stack overflow in WebAssembly which raises a normal trap and can be caught. This is instead to be used on misconfigured hosts where the async stack is too small or wasm was allowed to take up too much of the async stack. Currently no error message is printed and the program simply aborts with a core dump which can be difficult to debug.</p>\n<p>This instead registers the range of the async guard page with the trap handling infrastructure to test the faulting address and if it lies within this range. If so then a small message is printed and then the program is aborted with <code>libc::abort()</code>.</p>\n<p>This does not impact the safety of any prior embedding or fix any issues. It's instead intended purely as a diagnostic tool to help users more quickly understand that stack size configuration settings are the likely culprit.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
