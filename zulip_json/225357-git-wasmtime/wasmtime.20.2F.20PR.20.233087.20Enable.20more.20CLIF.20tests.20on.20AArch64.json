There is no way to match several NaN values in a test, so the solution is to extract the non-deterministic test cases into a separate file that is subsequently replicated for every backend under test, with adjustments made to the expected results.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The other reason is to preserve the current organization of having all runtests in one place, and some of the latter are already meant for a specific backend - the ones with <code>legacy</code> in their name (e.g. <code>cranelift/filetests/filetests/runtests/i128-arithmetic-legacy.clif</code>), though admittedly they should be removed eventually.</p>\n</blockquote>",
