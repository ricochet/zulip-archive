I believe the correct semantics here (at least as far as I understood the spec) are to pop new versions of the loop params off the stack at the point of the branch.</p>\n<p>This PR fixes <code>spec/multi-value/block-run.wast</code> in the <em>newer</em> version of <code>spec_testsuite</code>, which we aren't yet using in the wasmtime tree but which SpiderMonkey is. This bug was caught during integration of the multivalue work with SpiderMonkey.</p>\n<p>(The <code>loop-params.wast</code> test added in this PR is the one particular failing case from <code>block-run.wast</code>.)</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
