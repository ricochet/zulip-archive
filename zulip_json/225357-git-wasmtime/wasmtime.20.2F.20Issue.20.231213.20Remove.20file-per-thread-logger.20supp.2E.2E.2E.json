When I've done some debugging I've typically found it more useful to have all the output interleaved so I can figure out what else is going on at the same time as well. Otherwise though I figure we could use our own logger which prepends a thread-specific prefix (but doesn't require such intrusive management for us to name all the threads) or the logging would have a prefix you could grep for to see what you're interested in.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We could probably rework things so that it emits a log message per line, although if the lines have prefixes it's yet another step developers need to do to get an IR file out that they can test with.</p>\n<p>Would it be better if we emitted IR dumps somewhere outside of the logging mechanism?</p>\n</blockquote>",

I find the behavior of <code>RUST_LOG=foo wasmtime foo.wasm</code> spewing a lot of log files too surprising to be comfortable with, but we can figure something else out for that later if someone is motivated enough.</p>\n</blockquote>",
