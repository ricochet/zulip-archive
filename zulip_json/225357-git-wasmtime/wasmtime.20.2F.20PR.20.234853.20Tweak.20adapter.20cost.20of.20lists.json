The test case in question was a deeply recursive<br>\nlist-of-list-of-etc and only one function was generated instead of<br>\nmultiple. I updated the cost of strings/lists to cost more in the<br>\napproximate cost calculation which now forces the one giant function to<br>\nget split up and the large function is now split up into multiple<br>\nsmaller function that take milliseconds to compile.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
