For a random example, here's Cargo's copy of the Apache license, with the same line you highlighted:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE\">https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE</a></p>\n<p>Thanks in any case! I'll go ahead and close this issue.</p>\n</blockquote>",
