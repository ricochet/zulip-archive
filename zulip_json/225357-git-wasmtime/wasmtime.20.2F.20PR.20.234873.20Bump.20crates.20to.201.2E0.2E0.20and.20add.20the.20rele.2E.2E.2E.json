I've pushed the contents of that branch to a <code>release-1.0.0</code> branch and have updated all the version numbers of Wasmtime-related crates to 1.0.0 in this PR. I plan on deleting the <code>release-0.41.0</code> branch shortly since that release will not be made.</p>\n<p>I've additionally added somewhat extensive release notes to this PR as well for 1.0. I opted to add an \"internals\" section which tries to go through and list PRs related to major efforts, but there's a fair number of PRs so I'm curious if others feel like it's too much or if I should remove the PR links.</p>\n<p>Finally I've also left TODO entries for our three blog posts going out. We'll be able to update the URLs for two of them for sure but we may have to do some prediction to figure out the 1.0 one depending on how we want to order things.</p>\n</blockquote>",
