Specifically when lowering <code>Cond.If...</code> and the arguments needed swapping the condition was also inverted by accident. More <code>*.clif</code> runtests were added to catch this case and expose it. Additionally Pulley now has lowering for all the <code>FloatCC</code> orderings to be able to run the <code>select.clif</code> runtest which primarily exposed the issue.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
