Imagine someone driving down the highway and the workload traveling along edge compute with the user.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>Todo if the feature is interesting to the project.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>One alternative is to externalize state from the module through some stateful service / component interface. However, this would require module developers to take a dependency on some service interface and rebuild applications to integrate with this external state store.</p>\n<p>/cc @squillace<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

If it isn't due to optimizations I can only see it working for the exact same compiled version of the wasm to native code. Wasm code calling into user provided functions calling back into wasm code is effectively impossible to snapshot I think.</p>\n</blockquote>",
