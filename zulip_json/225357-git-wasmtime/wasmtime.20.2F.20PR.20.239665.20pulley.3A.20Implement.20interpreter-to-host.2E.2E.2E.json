The basic problem is that Pulley needs the ability to call back into Wasmtime to implement tasks such as <code>memory.grow</code>, imported functions, etc. For native platforms this is a simple <code>call_indirect</code> operation in Cranelift but the story for Pulley must be different because it's effectively switching from interpreted code to native code.</p>\n<p>The initial idea for this in #9651 is replaced here and looks mostly similar but with a few changes. The overall structure of how this works is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new <code>call_indirect_host</code> opcode is added to Pulley.<ul>\n<li>Function signatures that can be called from Pulley bytecode are statically enumerated at build-time.</li>\n<li>This enables the implementation of <code>call_indirect_host</code> to take an immediate of which signature is being used and cast the function pointer to the right type.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A new pulley-specific relocation is added to Cranelift for this opcode.<ul>\n<li><code>RelocDistance::Far</code> calls to a name trigger the use of <code>call_indirect_host</code>.</li>\n<li>The relocation is filled in by Wasmtime after compilation where the signature number is inserted.</li>\n<li>A new <code>NS_*</code> value for user-function namespaces is reserved in <code>wasmtime-cranelift</code> for this new namespace of functions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Code generation for Pulley in <code>wasmtime-cranelift</code> now has Pulley-specific handling of the wasm-to-host transition where all previous <code>call_indirect</code> instructions are replaced with a call to a \"backend intrinsic\" which gets lowered to a <code>call_indirect_host</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that most of this still isn't hooked up everywhere in Wasmtime. That means that the testing here is pretty light at this time. It'll require a fair bit more work to get everything fully integrated from Wasmtime in Pulley. This is expected to be one of the significant remaining chunks of work and should help unblock future testing (or make those diffs smaller ideally).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

The \"reloc time\" technically happens twice -- once when linking things into artifacts and again when loading the artifacts. Putting the signature into the instruction happens in the first of these, during linking time. The relocation here is needed because the <code>UserExternalName</code> isn't available during compilation, only after the compile has finished, so that level of relocation processing is required to stuff it in.</p>\n<p>Otherwise though there's no runtime relocation when we load the bytecode itself, it's all frozen and loaded as-is from disk or the compile artifact.</p>\n</blockquote>",
