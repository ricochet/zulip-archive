I tried to use the common <code>gen_call</code>, but that would require several extensions to properly support s390x:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need to use <code>accumulate_outgoing_args_size</code> instead of <code>emit_stack_pre_adjust</code> / <code>emit_stack_post_adjust</code>.</li>\n<li><code>ImplicitPtrArg</code> and the register version of <code>StructArg</code> are only implemented in ISLE right now.</li>\n<li>We need to lane-swap vector registers in case of a caller/callee ABI mismatch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Except for that last point, I have some implementation prototypes.  But even so, the resulting code was of lower quality than what I get with the ISLE-based logic today - in particular, with the ISLE logic we can better fold incoming argument expressions (e.g. into sign extension, or into the address used for a memory copy instruction).   Therefore I decided to stay with this approach.</p>\n<p>The generated code remains the same except for register allocation and instruction scheduling differences.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
