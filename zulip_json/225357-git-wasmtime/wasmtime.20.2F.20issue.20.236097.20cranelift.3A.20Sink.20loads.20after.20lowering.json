I'll inject some general caution that this is an extremely subtle problem space and I've been surprised by unexpected interactions, and there are a lot of hard-won (as in \"learned the hard way\") correctness conditions in the current code; all that to say, we should just be very careful with the replacement too!</p>\n<p>One general principle I'd want to try to stick to is that to whatever degree possible, I'd like to see the infrastructure for this built in a way that is not backend-specific. While it's true that we're thinking about load-merging now and that is mostly relevant for x86, there may be other kinds of side-effect motion that we want to do later (perhaps with traps, for example); so a system that reasons generally about sinking/hoisting and merging has value beyond just the x86 <code>RegMem</code> case. That doesn't have to mean that we have state in <code>machinst::Lower</code> as we do today -- maybe it's a separate <code>SinkingTracker</code> or somesuch.</p>\n<p>I suspect that your system can be generalized such that items in the queue are any side-effecting ops that we want to try to sink, is that right?</p>\n<p>It'd be worthwhile trying to write a (semi-formal) correctness argument for this, if you haven't yet. (It feels like the right kind of correctness property that is both extremely important, and tractable to actually show holds.) I think I can see how you'd argue that the total order of side-effecting ops (including loads) is maintained. The items in the queue represent a sliding window, but the order in the queue does not necessarily correspond to program order (it corresponds to use-order). Rather, we reconcile <em>with</em> program order as we pop, and discard (reject the sinking) anything that would have come out-of-order. So basically the queue only ever holds the in-(reverse)-use-order list of sinkable ops within a single inter-side-effect-window region of code. Is that right?</p>\n<p>(Also, I think we need to consider start-of-basic-block a \"side-effecting point\" that flushes the queue as well, unless you can make an argument about how the traversal order makes that unnecessary but my head is starting to hurt now :-) )</p>\n<p>Anyway, I look forward to seeing this work out!</p>\n</blockquote>",
