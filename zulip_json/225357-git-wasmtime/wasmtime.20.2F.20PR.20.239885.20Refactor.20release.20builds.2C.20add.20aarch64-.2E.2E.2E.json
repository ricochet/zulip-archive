The refactoring here is done to reduce the number of locations to understand release builds. Notably the <code>binary-compatible-builds</code> action was removed in favor of direct environment configuration in conjunction with docker images used to build. The <code>aarch64-musl</code> build itself happens in a container provided by the <code>cross</code> project to ensure that the right toolchain is configured.</p>\n<p>Closes #9875</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Mostly just make sure <code>./wasmtime --help</code> does something and maybe poke at the commands a bit. If that works I think this is probably good to go to eventually get integrated into wasmtime-py</p>\n</blockquote>",
