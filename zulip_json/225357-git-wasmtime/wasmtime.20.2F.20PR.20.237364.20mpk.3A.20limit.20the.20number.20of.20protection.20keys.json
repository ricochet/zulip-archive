If we simply multiple the number of memory slots needed to run the <code>*.wast</code> spec tests by fifteen, we run out of available memory. This limits the number of protection keys used to two, which still allows us to test the functionality without reserving too much memory.</p>\n<p>Also, if Wasmtime is ever embedded in an application that also uses memory protection keys, it could be useful to limit how many Wasmtime allocates and uses.. This change not only limits the number of protection keys used at runtime, but takes that<br>\nfurther to attempt to limit the initial number of keys allocated. The unfortunate side effect of using a <code>OnceLock</code> is that the <code>max</code> setting is only applicable on the first invocation, the one that sets the <code>OnceLock</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
