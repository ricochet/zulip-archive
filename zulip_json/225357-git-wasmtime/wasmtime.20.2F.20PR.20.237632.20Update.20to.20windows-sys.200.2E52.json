Personally, I see no reason to trust the windows-sys 0.48 published by Microsoft yet not windows-sys 0.51 given its FFI bindings, not some original library. If an attestation the changes are as expected is needed, I'd ask someone who has experience doing said reviews <em>and whose name actually means something to this project</em> performs said review. If no such explicit review is needed, I'd be happy to update the existing vet attestation if informed how.</p>\n</blockquote>",
