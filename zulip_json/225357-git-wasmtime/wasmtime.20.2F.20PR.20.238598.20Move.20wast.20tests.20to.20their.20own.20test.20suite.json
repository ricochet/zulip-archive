The motivation for this is well-described in #4861 with one of the chief reasons being that if the test suite is run and then a new file is added re-running the test suite won't see the file.</p>\n<p>The <code>libtest-mimic</code> crate provides an easy way of regaining most of the features of the <code>libtest</code> harness such as parallel test execution and filters, meaning that it's pretty easy to switch everything over. The only slightly-tricky bit was redoing the filter for whether a test is ignored or not, but most of the pieces were copied over from the previous <code>build.rs</code> logic.</p>\n<p>Closes #4861</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
