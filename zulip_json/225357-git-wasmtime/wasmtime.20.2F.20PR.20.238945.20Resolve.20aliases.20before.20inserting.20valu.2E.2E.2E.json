This is necessary because when we find a definition, we kill it from the live set, so at that point we only have the non-alias value.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It feels iffy to immediately resolve them inside cranelift-frontend as there is nothing preventing the alias that was resolved to be changed later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that the safepoint spilling and its liveness analysis happens as part of finishing a <code>FunctionBuilder</code>, so we don't need to worry about anything changing under our feet here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
