Other options include<br>\nmaintaining a separate MPK-enabled CI runner (configuration is not<br>\ntransparent, hard to maintain) or running the MPK-enabled tests in a<br>\nsystem-mode QEMU VM (tricky to get right, also hard to maintain). For<br>\nnow, those of us at the Cranelift meeting agreed this at least gets some<br>\nCI testing for the MPK bits, which shouldn't be changing too often.<br>\nSince not all GitHub runners have MPK available, we only set the<br>\n<code>WASMTIME_TEST_FORCE_MPK</code> environment variable when it is. This change<br>\nalso emits a warning to the GitHub logs in either case for easier<br>\ntroubleshooting (e.g., to attempt to provide context if MPK logic breaks<br>\nand is only found in a later CI run).</p>\n<p>prtest:full</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

That one could perhaps run just a small subset of the test suite as well. I'm also a bit worried about the inverse where we always run with MPK by accident somehow and never see issues when it's turned off.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, could the warning be tweaked a bit? Ideally what I'd imagine is that on failure a warning would be printed, but if everything succeeded no warning necessary as otherwise it can clutter up the view (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/7646831639?pr=7815\">this link</a> has a number of non-actionable warnings at the bottom)</p>\n</blockquote>",
