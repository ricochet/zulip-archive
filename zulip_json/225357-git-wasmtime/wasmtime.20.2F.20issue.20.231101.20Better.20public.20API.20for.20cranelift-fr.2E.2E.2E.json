They aren't strictly necessary since you can always either track the information yourself while adding instructions, or query the <code>Layout</code> and <code>DataFlowGraph</code>.</p>\n<p>But if we decide we do want helpers for these specific queries, a three-state enum as proposed here is a good idea. I made essentially this change internally in cranelift-frontend as part of #4989, introducing a <code>BlockStatus</code> enum.</p>\n<p>Still, I think we can safely close this issue.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Nicolas pointed out that the commentary makes it clear that it could really just be some <code>EbbState</code> enum, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">enum</span> <span class=\"nc\">EbbState</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">UnChanged</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">Changed</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">ChangedAndTerminated</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This would help us make better sense of the public interface, where <code>is_pristine()</code> and <code>is_filled()</code> functions are part of the <code>FunctionBuilder</code> public API (used by <code>cranelift-wasm</code>), but it isn't clear what those words refer to, so you have to go digging around.</p>\n</blockquote>",
