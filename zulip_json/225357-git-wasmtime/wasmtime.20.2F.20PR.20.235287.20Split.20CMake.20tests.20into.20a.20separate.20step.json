There<br>\ndoesn't appear to be any reuse between build artifacts from the CMake-based<br>\ntests and the cargo test step later on in the <code>Test</code> job, so this should speed<br>\nup the average build time.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this PR only runs the CMake tests on ubuntu and windows. I'd be<br>\nhappy to expand the matrix out to the same set as the <code>Test</code> job if we think<br>\nit's worth it.<br>\n&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
