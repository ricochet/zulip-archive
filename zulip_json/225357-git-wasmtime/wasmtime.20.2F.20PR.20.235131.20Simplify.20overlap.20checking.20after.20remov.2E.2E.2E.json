But it also means we're no longer borrowing from the <code>by_term</code> HashMap, so we can use <code>into_iter</code> instead of <code>values</code> to move ownership out of the map. That in turn means that we can use <code>into_iter</code> on each vector of rules as well, which turns out to offer a slightly nicer idiom for looping over all pairs, and also means we drop allocations as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>I also pushed grouping by priority earlier, so the O(n^2) all-pairs loop runs over smaller lists. If we later find we want to know about overlaps across different priorities, the definition of the map key is an easy place to make that change.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
