Among other things, this protected assumptions in wasi-libc that it can hold onto preopen file descriptors and rely on them always being open.</p>\n<p>However now, I think it makes sense to relax this restriction. wasi-libc itself doesn't expose the preopen file descriptors, so users shouldn't ever be closing them naively, unless they have wild closes. And toolchains other than wasi-libc may want to close preopens as a way to drop priveleges once the main file handles are opened.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
