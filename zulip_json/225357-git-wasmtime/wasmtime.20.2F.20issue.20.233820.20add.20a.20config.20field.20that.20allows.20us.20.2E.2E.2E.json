I did indeed mean during instantiation and while I don't think we want to eagerly pay the cost of initializing memory (as that defeats the original purpose of lazy init) there could be a theoretical case made for the first page fault on each page should be not as slow as going to disk. That being said I don't think we can guarantee that because we can't guarantee membership in the kernel's page cache with <code>mlock</code>.</p>\n<p>If we still want to lazily page things in, though, then I think this may want to use <code>mlock2</code> with <code>MLOCK_ONFAULT</code> because currently it uses <code>mlock</code> which I believe guarantees that everything is resident after <code>mlock</code> returns so it would have rss and startup time implications.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It can be useful however in settings where the goal is to have close to full memory usage at all times, but with most data being evictable because it's just there for caching purposes. In such a setting, there's often more information available on the application level than on the kernel level about which data is more important to retain, and this is an attempt to make use of that information in a better way.</p>\n</blockquote>",
