Out of curiosity do you know if a sightglass run has been done to confirm there's no perf regression?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, there were multiple runs at various points here, and there is no longer any gap between <code>tail</code> and <code>wasmtime-systemv</code> anymore. In fact, I'm 99% sure the two calling conventions are identical when there aren't any actual tail calls.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Could the validation/etc be done without needing <code>mut self</code> on <code>Config::validate</code>? Instead could this preserve the <code>&amp;self</code>-ness and perhaps add other validations to ensure the stars align right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We tried to do this in <code>Config::new</code> initially, but because we don't know the compilation strategy (cranelift vs winch) or target (s309x or not) yet, we therefore don't know what default value to choose.</p>\n<p>The only alternatives I see are</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Checking these conditions when setting every related knob (i.e. check that the target isn't set to s390x when enabling tail calls, check that tail calls aren't set when configuring s390x as a target, etc...). This is annoying because there are now many checks to keep in sync with each other.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enable tail calls by default, don't change any other logic. This effectively will require that s390x and winch configs explicitly disable tail calls, which is kind of annoying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Move the choose-the-default-if-it-wasn't-explicitly-configured logic we added here out of <code>validate</code> and into a <code>finalize_defaults</code> method or something that is called just before <code>validate</code>. This way <code>validate</code> would still be <code>&amp;self</code> and we would have a clear division between validation and default computation. But this is sort of just rearranging deck chairs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't enable tail calls by default until all configs can support them. This is pretty suboptimal. Do we just wait for s390x? Or winch too? This could be a long time and I really want to start leveraging all the good work that has gone into this feature, deleting the old calling conventions, and all that. FWIW, we have prior art of enabling wasm features by default on some targets but not others when they aren't ready there yet (reference types, for example).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>",
