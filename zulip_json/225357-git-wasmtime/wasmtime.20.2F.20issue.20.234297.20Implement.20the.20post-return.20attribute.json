For now I couldn't think of a better alternative that improved on the ergonomics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the <code>TypedFunc::call</code> API returns owned rather than borrowed values, it could call post-return itself, right? Another option would be to accept a closure called with the return value which transforms the return value and call post-return after calling this closure.</p>\n</blockquote>",
