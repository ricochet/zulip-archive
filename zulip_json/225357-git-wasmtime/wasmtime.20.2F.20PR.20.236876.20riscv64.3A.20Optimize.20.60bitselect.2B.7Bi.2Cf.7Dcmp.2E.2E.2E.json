Here we optimize that pattern into a mask generation instruction and <code>vmerge.vvm</code> that merges both inputs.</p>\n<p>This allows us to avoid the quite long sequence for bitselect (4 instructions) and also vector mask expansion (1 instruction) in these patterns.</p>\n<p>For tests here I'm relying mostly on wasmtimes wast testsuite.</p>\n</blockquote>",
