In general (#5537) Wasmtime's support for DWARF needs to be rewritten, but in the meantime let's play whack-a-mole with panics and try to paper over issues.</p>\n<p>Closes #8884<br>\nCloses #8904</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
