In order to maintain Rust safety guarantees in the presence of WebAssembly shared memory, which can be modified concurrently by any of the running threads, the WASI implementations of <code>fd_read</code> and <code>fd_pread</code> were given special code paths when shared memory is detected: in these cases, the data is first read into a host-limited buffer and then subsequently copied into linear memory. The problem was that the rather-complex logic for doing this \"buffer then copy\" idea for multiple IO vectors could fail due to buffer underflow. If, e.g., a read was limited by the host to 64K (or even if the read returned less than the total buffer size) the <code>UnsafeGuestSlice::copy_from_slice</code> logic would fail, complaining that the sizes of both buffers were unequal.</p>\n<p>This change both simplifies and fixes the logic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>only the first IO vector is filled; this could represent a performance penalty for threaded programs, but the \"buffer then copy\" idea already imposes a non-trivial overhead. This simplifies the logic, allowing us to...</li>\n<li>resize the shared memory buffer to the exact number of bytes read</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
