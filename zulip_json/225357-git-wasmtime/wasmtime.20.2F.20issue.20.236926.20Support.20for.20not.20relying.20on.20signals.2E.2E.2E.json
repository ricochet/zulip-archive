This is because we \"dedupe\" the spectre guard bounds check and the dynamic memory's bounds check. We could stop doing that when in this no-signals mode, but do note that that would make the slowdown of dynamic bounds checks go from ~1.5x to closer to ~2x compared to using virtual memory guard pages.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An additional positive of this note would be that it allows more testing of Cranelift, as it's my understanding some of the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime/topic/Option.20to.20disable.20signal.20handling/near/386688540\">trap handling code is not run in tests/fuzzing</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that this is just for the cranelift-specific fuzzing and tests.</p>\n<p>Wasmtime fuzzing does exercise trapping.</p>\n</blockquote>",
