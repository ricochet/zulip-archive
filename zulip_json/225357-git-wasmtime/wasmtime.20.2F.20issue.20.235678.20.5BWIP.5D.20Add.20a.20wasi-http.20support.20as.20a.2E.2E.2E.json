We are excited to flesh out wasi-http and package an implementation with wasmtime. Right now the Bytecode Alliance is in the middle of a big transformation rebasing all of the Wasi interfaces on the component model, so we may need to make a couple of larger architectural changes to the approach to fit with the new way of doing things. Weâ€™ll take some time to review and figure out where those changes affect this work. We'll definitely be getting back to you, thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
