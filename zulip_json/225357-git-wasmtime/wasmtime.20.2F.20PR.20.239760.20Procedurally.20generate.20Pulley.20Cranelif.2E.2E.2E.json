This procedurally generates a few new items for Cranelift's Pulley backend to use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>RawInst</code> - a raw enumeration of instructions as-is.</li>\n<li>ISLE constructors (e.g. <code>pulley_*</code> ctors) - generated for all of the <code>RawInst</code> variants.</li>\n<li>Register allocation methods for <code>RawInst</code></li>\n<li>Pretty printing methods for <code>RawInst</code></li>\n<li>Emission methods for <code>RawInst</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>Inst</code> enum now has a <code>Raw</code> variant which contains a <code>RawInst</code>. In this manner the main <code>Inst</code> enum can still have pseudo-insts like <code>Call</code>, polymorphic instructions like loads/stores (probably gonna get refactored in the future though), and slightly different representations such as <code>Inst::Trap</code> having a <code>TrapCode</code> and <code>RawInst::Trap</code> wouldn't.</p>\n<p>The goal of this commit is to lower the amount of effort to quickly add and experiment with new instructions in Pulley. Ideally it's now just (a) define them in the pulley macro, (b) implement a direct lowering rule, and (c) implement it in the interpreter. Ideally no need to implement anything else inside of Cranelift as everything should be auto-generated.</p>\n<p>Many existing <code>Inst</code> variants have been deleted in favor of their equivalents in <code>RawInst</code> now. This undeniably increases the complexity of the Pulley backend but at least for me I find it well worth it to have all this boilerplate generated automatically.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
