When running in interpreter vs interpreter mode, we just run the mid end passes. Some of these can actually increase the number of instructions that the interpreter has to run (i.e. <code>stack_load -&gt; load+stack_addr</code>), this can cause a timeout in the second run if we were barely at the fuel limit on the first run.</p>\n<p>The solution here is to ignore timeouts in the second run. They can only happen if the second run is an interpreter run since we don't have timeouts in host runs. <br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

Does the interpreter count instructions executed, and the native execution doesn't, and that's why you don't expect timeouts from native execution? Assuming that's true, this seems great.</p>\n</blockquote>",
