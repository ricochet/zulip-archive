Sorry should have mentioned that... The cherry-pick didn't apply cleanly so I threw away the test-programs changes and wanted to see if it would pass. I believe it works because between 9 and 10 the preview2 support started landing which involed refactoring the test suite build. The refactoring initially used <code>rustup run stable ...</code> whereas on 9 it only uses <code>cargo build ...</code> so no changes ended up being needed.</p>\n</blockquote>",
