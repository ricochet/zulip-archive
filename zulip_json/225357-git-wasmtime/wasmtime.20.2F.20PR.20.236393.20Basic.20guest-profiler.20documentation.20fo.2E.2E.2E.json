I'd welcome feedback, although of course we can merge this and fill in details later.</p>\n<p>This documentation reflects the changes merged in #6362, but that merged after the 9.0 branch was created. Perhaps we should backport that PR to 9.0 so the older CLI flags never appear in a release?</p>\n</blockquote>",

I suspect many will scan over this page, see two bullets, and deduce there's two means of profiling Wasmtime. I'm sure many more yet will read further and realize there's a third, but having them all in one organized bulleted list I think makes sense (with all the existing commentary about which is appropriate of course)</p>\n</blockquote>",
