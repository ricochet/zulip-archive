Does a <code>b8</code> store <code>true</code> as 1, or as all-ones (<code>0xff</code>)?</p>\n<p>We've settled on the latter because of some use-cases where the wide<br>\nbool becomes a mask -- see #2058 for more on this.</p>\n<p>This is fine, and transparent, to most operations within CLIF, because<br>\nthe bool-typed value still has only two semantically-visible states,<br>\nnamely <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>\n<p>However, we have to be careful with bool-to-int conversions. <code>bint</code> on<br>\naarch64 correctly masked the all-ones value down to 0 or 1, as required<br>\nby the instruction specification, but on x64 it did not. This PR fixes<br>\nthat bug and makes x64 consistent with aarch64.</p>\n<p>While staring at this code I realized that <code>bextend</code> was also not<br>\nconsistent with the all-ones invariant: it should do a sign-extend, not<br>\na zero-extend as it previously did. This is also rectified and tested.<br>\n(Aarch64 also already had this case implemented correctly.)</p>\n<p>Fixes #3003.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
