I originally thought it<br>\nwas going to be fixed with <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=12722\">https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=12722</a><br>\nbut that no longer appears to be the case now that the <code>v8</code> crate has<br>\ncaught up and it still isn't fixed. Personally I've sort of lost an<br>\nappetite for continuing to debug these issues so I figure it's best to<br>\njust disable reference types with v8 for now and exercise the rest of<br>\nthe engine, e.g. simd.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
