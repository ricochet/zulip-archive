E.g. <code>--dir host=a;guest=b</code>, or even <code>--dir host=a guest=b</code>, where you can put host and guest in whatever order you want?</p>\n<p>I'm trying to think through how the delimiters/escaping would work, and I realised I don't understand how it works today â€” e.g. what happens if your path contains <code>::</code>. Is the answer \"don't have silly paths\"? <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>\n<p>I ask this because these kinds of order-dependent syntaxes (Docker volume mounts, SSH port forwarding, etc.) have caused me seemingly endless confusion and suffering, and I'm not sure if I'm uniquely vulnerable to them or if this is something that lots of other people would like to be able to avoid as well.</p>\n</blockquote>",
