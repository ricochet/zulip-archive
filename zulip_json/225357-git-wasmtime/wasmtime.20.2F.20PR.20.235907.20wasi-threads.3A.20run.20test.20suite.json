It relies on a Wasmtime CLI binary being available and runs all <code>*.wasm</code> and <code>*.wat</code> files present in the test suite directory. The results of each execution are compared against a JSON spec file with the same base name as the WebAssembly module. The spec file defines the expected exit code, e.g.</p>\n<p>This commit does not yet build any <code>*.c</code> or <code>*.s</code> files from the test suite. That could be done later, perhaps upstream; in the meantime, this work is still valuable as it lays the foundation for running other WASI tests from the in-progress [wasi-testsuite] which share the same JSON spec infrastructure.</p>\n<p>[test suite]: <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-threads/tree/main/test/testsuite\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-threads/tree/main/test/testsuite</a><br>\n[wasi-testsuite]: <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-testsuite\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-testsuite</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
