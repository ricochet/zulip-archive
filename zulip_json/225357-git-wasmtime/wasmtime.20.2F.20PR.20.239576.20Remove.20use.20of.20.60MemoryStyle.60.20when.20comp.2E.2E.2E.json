The diff here is large-ish but it's mostly accounted for via code movement and indentation changes. The high-level changes made to the structure of the code are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Metadata for PCC is de-indented and uses similar coarse determination for what facts to attach as before. Note that there's still a disconnect between PCC facts being applied and the actual load/store itself and so fully supporting PCC will probably require more refactoring in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cases have been reordered for actually emitting a bounds check. Due to there no longer being a top-level static/dynamic branch the cases have been reordered in terms of priority -- for example unconditional trapping is first, then elision of bounds checks, then the assumption the bound limit is a constant, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cases for bounds checks have had their arms rewritten in terms of the new properties. The main new one is that the fallback case for static memories previously which had a bounds check is a little more complicated as it additionally factors in <code>memory_may_move</code> in addition to <code>memory_reservation</code>. This is captured in the expanded documentation for this case, however.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Documentation was updated to avoid talking about static/dynamic memories.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
