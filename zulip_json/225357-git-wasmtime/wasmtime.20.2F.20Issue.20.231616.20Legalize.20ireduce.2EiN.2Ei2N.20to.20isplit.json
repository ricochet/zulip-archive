And, that the legalization in fact does not seem to apply when in that group.</p>\n<p>I found that in <code>narrow</code> or <code>widen</code> that only one of the legalizations actually made it to the generated legalizer (the i128 reduction) but from the failing test that doesn't seem to apply either. I _think_ what's happening is the <code>ireduce</code> legalization has bounded types, so by <a href=\"https://github.com/whitequark/wasmtime/blob/15e43610e191b30b29424f6d3cd7b320050e41a5/cranelift/codegen/meta/src/isa/x86/mod.rs#L40\" title=\"https://github.com/whitequark/wasmtime/blob/15e43610e191b30b29424f6d3cd7b320050e41a5/cranelift/codegen/meta/src/isa/x86/mod.rs#L40\"><code>legalize_monomorphic</code></a> in the x86_32 cpu definition legalization is run through <code>expand_flags</code>, which eventually is chained to the base <code>expand</code> legalizer. I don't know why codegen would vary across groups though.</p>\n<p>I see other legalizations through <code>narrow</code> appear to have an unbounded parameter, or use a type otherwise undeclared (like <code>I128</code>) , so I think this about where to look. And I believe <code>ireduce</code> falls over with an unbounded type because of the constraint that the result must be half the size of the input.</p>\n<p>This all definitely is not straightforward, and I suspect the missing cases when these legalizations are in <code>narrow</code> or <code>widen</code> might be a bug in the code generator for the legalizer, but finding a somewhat compelling reason why this ought to be in <code>expand</code> is all I was really after.
