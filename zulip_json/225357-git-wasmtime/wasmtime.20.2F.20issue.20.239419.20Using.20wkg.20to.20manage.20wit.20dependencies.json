The main idea here is to start using the packaging tooling in all the places where it makes sense and it would avoid needing to copy/paste interfaces around</p>\n<p>The main changes this would entail are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We would commit a <code>wkg.lock</code> file in each of the wasi crates</li>\n<li>Updates to contributing/developer docs to indicate that <code>wkg</code> should be used for updating the dependencies</li>\n<li>(Optional) We would no longer commit the deps directory and instead fetch at build time. This would require an update to the build pipelines. This isn't a requirement but would make things cleaner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm totally fine if people don't want to use this, but wanted to at least bring it up for discussion! If we do want to do this, I can do the work to enable it</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think the best way to start would be to replace <code>ci/vendor-wit.sh</code>with <code>wkg</code>, so we'd still check in everything to the repo, but CI would run <code>wkg</code> instead of a \"random bash script\" to ensure that everything is vendored correctly (or the \"random bash script\" would be much simpler and just run <code>wkg</code> in a view invocations)</p>\n</blockquote>",
