You can answer the questions below if<br>\nthey're relevant and delete this text before submitting. Thanks for opening an<br>\nissue! --&gt;</p>\n<h4>Feature</h4>\n<p>RELRO is a security feature that makes as much sections as possible readonly after performing dynamic relocations.<br>\n&lt;!-- What is the feature or code improvement you would like to do in<br>\nCranelift/Wasmtime? --&gt;</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>Improved security.<br>\n&lt;!-- What is the value of adding this in Cranelift/Wasmtime? --&gt;</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>Cranelift will need to get a PIC mode that doesn't use a PLT, but only a GOT. Then cranelift-object will need to be changed to use <code>.data.rel.ro</code> instead of <code>.data</code> for relocatable readonly data objects. There may be other steps necessary. This should all be optional.</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>\nalgorithms to use? --&gt;</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Not implementing this and thus having a bit less security.<br>\n&lt;!-- Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they<br>\nbetter or worse than your proposal? --&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
