This is actually what we want and I'm happy to see it worked: otherwise, if we allow merges of non-rebased ISLE source, the checked-in generated source will go through a git merge as well and who knows how well that'd correspond (due to e.g. renumbered temps, different trie build orders, etc).</p>\n<p>Also I had to disable the ISLE build logic via a special Cargo feature in the \"Meta deterministic check\"; as explained in the commit message, this runs the build script outside of the source tree, which worked previously because the default build options did not look for ISLE source, but now they do. The CI job is checking other output (unrelated to ISLE) though, so this seems fine.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'll leave it as-is for this PR and create a followup issue to track it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
