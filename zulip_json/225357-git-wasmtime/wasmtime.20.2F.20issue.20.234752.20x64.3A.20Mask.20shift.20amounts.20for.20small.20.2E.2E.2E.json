Good catch on noticing that <code>const_to_type_masked_imm8</code> had the same bug. I'm pleased to see so many of those <code>and</code> instructions disappear from the filetests. And it's great to see the ISLE rules and supporting Rust get both simpler and more correct at the same time!</p>\n</blockquote>",
