However, Mach port namespaces aren't inherited in a child process.</p>\n<p>So I suspect we're going to run into an issue whenever an <code>Engine</code> is created prior to a <code>fork()</code>; I'm not sure exactly what our policy is on supporting fork as there's lots of complex, OS-specific initialization in the engine, but this code is clearly not intended to be fork-aware.</p>\n<p>Note that there is a compile-time feature (<code>posix-signals-on-macos</code>) which will forego the Mach exception ports integration in favor of traditional signal handlers; it might be worth seeing if you can build the Wasmtime C API with this feature flag and see if it helps with this issue.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think that the best solution here might be to recommend that macOS users who want to leverage <code>fork</code> should use signals via the Cargo feature rather than the default mach ports. If this is common then one option we could support is to make this a runtime configuration option instead of a compile-time configuration option too.</p>\n<p>Otherwise though the issues on macOS that I found difficult to handle are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trap handling can't be Engine-local because the process's exception ports are, well, process-global. </li>\n<li>It's technically possible to shut down the ports/handler thread when <code>Engine</code>s all go away, but that IMO is kind of spooky action-at-a-distance where you have to be certain that no <code>Engine</code> is in existence which you may not necessarily always have control over (although I realize it's reasonable for this use case)</li>\n<li>One option is to use <code>pthread_atfork</code>, but the problem with that is that it's unclear if all forks are intended for this sort of use case where the process continues to live of if it's something ephemeral such as a fork-then-exec combo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I suppose that can all be mostly summarized as I think the only possibly-feasible thing to do here is to shut everything down when an <code>Engine</code> is destroyed, but I'm not personally all that comfortable doing that as it doesn't align with other platforms and I'm also not certain how robust we can make it.</p>\n<p>Otherwise though @thibaultcha I'd ask you if having a custom build is difficult for y'all? If so we can move the signals-vs-ports to a runtime option instead. Additionally one other mitigation we could implement is to use <code>pthread_atfork</code> to force any wasm execution in the child to panic immediately rather than continue in a broken state, effectively having a more precise way of warning developers that \"hey ports aren't compatible with fork please use this other thing to use signals instead\"</p>\n</blockquote>",

It is ok for us to have a custom build, although a runtime configuration option would be even better since it means users can download any of the upstream Wasmtime releases which imho is ideal for a friction-less experience. How much work do you foresee that be? Perhaps it could be something one of us could contribute (a difficulty is that none of us on my team has access to a Macbook, but maybe we can write the patch off a box if it isn't too big).</p>\n<p>Although, I do hope relying on this feature in the long run won't be a hassle for us (e.g. if Wasmtime on macos focuses more efforts &amp; fixes on trap handling through ports at the detriment of signal dispositions); in which case having tighter control over the port handlers might be preferable, since we could shut it down before <code>fork()</code> and ensure all of our processes rely on the same mechanisms Wasmtime invests into... </p>\n</blockquote>",

Not too much work but no worries I've done some initial bits in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6807\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6807</a> now. If you'd like though some help in implementing a corresponding option in the C API would be appreciated!</p>\n<p>As for the long term you should be good. Unix signals are unlikely to be as battle-tested as Mach ports because they're off-by-default for macOS, but they're turn on-by-default for Linux for example which means they're not completely untested. Y'all aren't the first to want to use signals instead of mach ports as well so it's something that I'd at least personally like to see continued support for in Wasmtime. Basically that's to say that, yes, you may run into future issues. I think we'll be interested in fixing them promptly, though, if they arise.</p>\n</blockquote>",
