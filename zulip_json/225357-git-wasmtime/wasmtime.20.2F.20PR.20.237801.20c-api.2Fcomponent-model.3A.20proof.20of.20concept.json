I like the idea of the approach here to start with C/C++ APIs and kinda go from there. I want to point out some points though and provide some thoughts on what you've already implemented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'd recommend planning out resources pretty early on. They radically change a lot of things if they weren't previously accounted for so you'll want to make sure they're taken care of. (e.g. borrows, owns, etc)</li>\n<li>Indices-vs-strings is an interesting question. I think it can go either way, but I additionally think we'll want the ability to inspect type information. For example the enum variant 2 is not the same across different enums. Additionally the enum variant name \"foo\" also isn't the same across enums. With type information though this can all be equated and the name and/or index can be \"resolved\" what its relative to.</li>\n<li>I'm all for some sort of <code>Val::new_unchecked</code> but I've given it no thought as to what it would look like other than \"that should probably exist and I have no idea what it would look like\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drawing from the parallels of the C API for wasm there's sort of two modes for values - one where a value is tagged with its type and one where a value is \"unchecked\" and you assert it's the right type. That might be good to follow with components as well where what you've sketched out so far is the untagged/unchecked version so far (I know there's a tag for a kind but it's more of a discriminant than \"this is the type of the value\"). That'd roughly correspond to <code>TypedFunc</code> and <code>Func</code> in the Rust API sort of.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I mean moreso <code>wasmtime_func_call</code> vs <code>wasmtime_func_call_unchecked</code> which is <code>Func::call</code> vs <code>Func::call_unchecked</code>. The latter isn't typed but additionally is <code>unsafe</code> since you assert that whatever you passed is the correct type.</p>\n<p>The component model is trickier in this regard where it's not as obvious how a list of records with variants of strings should be laid out in memory (compared to a <code>i32</code>). One idea I've toyed with is that the \"raw\" version of the component model is the canonical ABI, not a structured value.
