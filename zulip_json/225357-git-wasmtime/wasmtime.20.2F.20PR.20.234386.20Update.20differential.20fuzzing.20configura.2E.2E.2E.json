There's no<br>\n  particular reason to limit differential execution to just one and we<br>\n  may want to explore other interesting module shapes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More than one function type is now allowed to possibly allow more<br>\n  interesting <code>block</code> types.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Memories are now allowed to grow beyond one page, but still say small<br>\n  by staying underneath 10 pages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tables are now always limited in their growth to ensure consistent<br>\n  behavior across engines (e.g. with the pooling allocator vs v8).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>export_everything</code> feature is used instead of specifying a<br>\n  min/max number of exports.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>wasmi</code> differential fuzzer was updated to still work if memory is<br>\nexported, but otherwise the v8 differential fuzzer already worked if a<br>\nfunction was exported but a memory wasn't. Both fuzzers continue to<br>\nexecute only the first exported function.</p>\n<p>Also notable from this update is that the <code>SwarmConfig</code> from<br>\n<code>wasm-smith</code> will now include an arbitrary <code>allowed_instructions</code><br>\nconfiguration which may help explore the space of interesting modules<br>\nmore effectively.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
