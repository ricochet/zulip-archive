That will indicate memory that wasm had accessible but not necessarily the memory that wasm used (e.g. reserved address space but it it may not all be paged in by the OS). If you're curious about actual page usage you'd need to get the actual <code>Memory</code> object to use APIs like <code>mincore</code> to see if it's actually paged in.</p>\n</blockquote>",
