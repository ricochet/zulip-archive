This function, however, has a different interface in libgcc vs libunwind. This means that we need to detect which is being used and adapt our calls to it appropriately.</p>\n<p>Previously this decision was static. FreeBSD and Linux glibc would assume libgcc and everything else was assumed to be libunwind. It's possible to use libgcc on other platforms, however, such as with musl. The goal of this PR is to make the detection here more robust.</p>\n<p>Specifically this PR now probes for a symbol at runtime rather than relying on a compile-time decision. That way we can see what we got at runtime and make the decision then.</p>\n<p>Closes #7997</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
