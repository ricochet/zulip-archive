Put another way, what would we lose if we remove the <code>Option</code> wrapper from those return types? I understand the use of <code>Option</code> for fallible non-multi extractors, but I'm not sure how that extends here. I'd prefer to just use an empty iterator to indicate that the extractor failed, if that's not too much trouble, because otherwise the types appear to permit two ways of encoding the same situation.</p>\n<p>I don't see any documentation for how someone writing an external multi-extractor should implement the auto-generated traits. I don't think that's strictly necessary before merging this, but if that documentation existed then I would look for the answer to the above question there.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Functionally there is no difference, and the main reason is just to manage complexity: otherwise we have a special case wherever we have a match failure in that we have to invent an empty iterator rather than return <code>None</code>. If it were one code-generator site then maybe that's fine, but we also use the <code>?</code> operator everywhere and I didn't want to work out how to get auto-conversions going with that. It's simpler to stick to the invariant that all constructors live in the <code>Option</code> monad and let the <code>Try</code> magic do its thing.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We verified that the only difference was additional types and traits related to <code>ContextIter</code>. As a result I'm convinced that this is safe to merge as-is. I haven't fully understood the multi-extractors and multi-constructors, but since we don't use any of those yet, we can fix any issues that come up when we start trying to use them, instead of worrying about them now.</p>\n</blockquote>",
