Currently the failure logs are for s390x and match the failures in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4487\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4487</a>. I don't know what the failures are.</p>\n<p>On the other hand though 0.39.0 has already been released to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> and github actions. Additionally this is a security release.</p>\n<p>I'm going to go ahead and merge this under the assumption that the s390x failures are not otherwise introduced by the security patches but being either in our test infrastructure or preexisting bugs. In both cases I believe it's safe to move forward with the release here and we can fix up CI later.</p>\n<p>Given that I'm going to merge. We can do another point release if necessary for s390x-specific issues.</p>\n</blockquote>",
