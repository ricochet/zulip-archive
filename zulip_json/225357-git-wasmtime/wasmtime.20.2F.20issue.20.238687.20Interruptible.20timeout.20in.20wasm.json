That will determine what kind of <code>pollable</code>s you'll pass to the <code>poll</code> function in addition to the <code>monotonic-clock.subscribe_duration</code> pollable that represents the timeout.  Should it be readability on a TCP socket?  Progress on an outgoing HTTP request?  Something else?  All of the above?</p>\n</blockquote>",
