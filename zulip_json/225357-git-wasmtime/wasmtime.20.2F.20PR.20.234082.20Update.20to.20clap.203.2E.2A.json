The intent here is to ensure that we're<br>\nusing maintained versions of the dependencies as structopt and clap 2<br>\nare less maintained nowadays. Most transitions were pretty<br>\nstraightforward and mostly dealing with structopt/clap3 differences.</p>\n<p>Along the way this also improves <code>cargo deny</code> a bit to ignore old crates we're using with outdated dependencies.</p>\n</blockquote>",
