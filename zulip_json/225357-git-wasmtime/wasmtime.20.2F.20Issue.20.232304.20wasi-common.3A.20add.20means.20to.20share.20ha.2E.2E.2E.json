However, I'm not so sure that this is the correct approach.</p>\n<p>The <code>EntryTable</code> is a map of capability handles (u32s) to capabilities (entries, which are always files at the moment, but will have lots of other types one day soon). This mapping needs to exist because wasm instances cannot yet use reference types, which can be used directly to implement capabilities. So, I think that it makes the most sense for an EntryTable to be used by only one single WasiCtx.</p>\n<p>It is very desirable to share capabilities between different instances. I think we should expose the accessor, insertion, and deletion operations on a WasiCtx's entrytable as part of the WasiCtx api, so that the runtime can share a file between instances by getting it out of one wasictx and inserting it into another.</p>\n<p>As an implementation note, I would prefer if entries were send and sync for multithreaded and async runtimes, so we'd want to use Arc instead of Rc, etc. A big part of my goals in #2205 is to get the scheduler abstraction modularized so it can be used in <code>async</code> rust, and I'll be adding support for async file read/write at some point soon as well.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think it will end up being compatible with what we have here, but permit the wasi table to contain directories and other sort of handles/capabilities (sockets, http, etc), instead of treating <code>Fd</code> as both file and directories. <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/pch/wasi_common_cap_std/crates/wasi-c2\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/pch/wasi_common_cap_std/crates/wasi-c2</a></p>\n<p>This work is pretty incomplete, at the moment it is focused on fleshing out system-interface and cap-std to have all the facilities required to implement wasi, so that we can abandon the gnarly <code>wasi-common::sys</code> hierarchy in favor of those crates. It will eventually be merged into the wasi-common crate, but I found it easier to start from a clean slate for this sort of exploration.</p>\n</blockquote>",
