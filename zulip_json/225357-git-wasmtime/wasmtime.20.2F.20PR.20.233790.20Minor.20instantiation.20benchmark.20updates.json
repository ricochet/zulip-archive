Unfortunately I couldn't find a way<br>\n  in criterion to test whether a <code>BenchmarkId</code> is filtered out or not so<br>\n  we rely on the runtime laziness to initialize on the first run for<br>\n  benchmarks that do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All files located in <code>benches/instantiation</code> are now loaded for<br>\n  benchmarking instead of a hardcoded list. This makes it a bit easier<br>\n  to throw files into the directory and have them benchmarked instead of<br>\n  having to recompile when working with new files.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally a module deserialization benchmark was added to measure the<br>\n  time it takes to deserialize a precompiled module from disk (inspired<br>\n  by discussion on #3787)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I was at it I also upped some limits to be able to instantiate<br>\ncfallin's <code>spidermonkey.wasm</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
