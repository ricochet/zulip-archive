This was done in a<br>\nplatform-specific manner, however, which means that I can no longer<br>\nreliably take the fuzz reproducer cases from oss-fuzz and reproduce them<br>\nlocally on an aarch64 machine. This commit fixes this problem by<br>\nunconditionally pulling bytes from the input for fuzz features,<br>\nirrespective of the host platform. Features are then discarded if<br>\nthey're not applicable.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
