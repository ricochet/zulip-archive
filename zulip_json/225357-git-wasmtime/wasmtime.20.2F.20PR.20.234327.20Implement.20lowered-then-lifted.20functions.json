The main things implemented in this commit are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Component instances are now assigned a <code>RuntimeComponentInstanceIndex</code><br>\n  to differentiate each one. This will be used in the future to detect<br>\n  fusion (one instance lowering a function from another instance). For<br>\n  now it's used to allocate separate <code>VMComponentFlags</code> for each<br>\n  internal component instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>CoreExport&lt;FuncIndex&gt;</code> of lowered functions was changed to a<br>\n<code>CoreDef</code> since technically a lowered function can use another lowered<br>\n  function as the callee. This ended up being not too difficult to plumb<br>\n  through as everything else was already in place.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A need arose to compile host-to-wasm trampolines which weren't already<br>\n  present. Currently wasm in a component is always entered through a<br>\n  host-to-wasm trampoline but core wasm modules are the source of all<br>\n  the trampolines. In the case of a lowered-then-lifted function there<br>\n  may not actually be any core wasm modules, so component objects now<br>\n  contain necessary trampolines not otherwise provided by the core wasm<br>\n  objects. This feature required splitting a new function into the<br>\n<code>Compiler</code> trait for creating a host-to-wasm trampoline. After doing<br>\n  this core wasm compilation was also updated to leverage this which<br>\n  further enabled compiling trampolines in parallel as opposed to the<br>\n  previous synchronous compilation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
