Instead of having dynamic errors at runtime for<br>\nthings like \"you can't lift a <code>String</code>\" that's instead a static<br>\ncompile-time error now.</p>\n<p>While I was doing this split I also refactored the <code>ComponentParams</code><br>\ntrait a bit to have <code>ComponentType</code> as a supertrait instead of a subtype<br>\nwhich made its implementations a bit more compact. Additionally its impl<br>\nblocks were folded into the existing tuple impl blocks.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
