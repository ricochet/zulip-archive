Totally fine to follow up with it; just want to make sure I understand the plans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, I was planning to continue working on this as a follow up.  Given that with this PR merged, that follow-up is no longer expected to have any impact on code generation / correctness, but is solely about cleaning up the IR, I think we can take some time to make sure we get it right.</p>\n<p>The details will probably require a bit more discussion, e.g. the exact CLIF IR changes (names of the new instructions etc.), and possibly a transition plan: do we need to continue to support the old <code>raw_bitcast</code> for a while to avoid breaking existing users, are there any existing <code>raw_bitcast</code> users that don't readily fit into the new scheme (e.g. bitcasts between types of different sizes), etc.</p>\n<p>I'll go ahead and try to investigate these issues as far as I can, and then come back with findings or a proposal for further discussion in issue #4566.</p>\n</blockquote>",
