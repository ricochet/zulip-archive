I ask because if possible I'd like to be conservative and not have them supported.

That could sort of be fixed here maybe with something like more generics or similar but it may also be inevitable to some degree. Ideally though the <code>HashMap</code> here could be avoided along with the string lookups at runtime for invoking methods.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'll leave it as is for now, but one other thought while we're on the topic: we could change the <code>HashMap</code> to a <code>Vec&lt;WildcardMatch&gt;</code>, add a <code>fn name() -&gt; &amp;str</code> accessor to <code>WildcardMatch</code>, and change <code>fn get_wildcard_match(&amp;self, name: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;WildcardMatch&gt;</code> to <code>get_wildcard_matches(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;[Wildcard]</code>.
