That it has any effect possibly involves some combination of the RA's spill-cost heuristics and/or isel reaching back for operands over basic block boundaries and/or the possibility that isel has separately created an instruction to do the multiply.  There's no particular reason it would have this effect in other cases, and I'd prefer not to have to reason about it when trying to debug these RA effects -- things are complicated enough without it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
