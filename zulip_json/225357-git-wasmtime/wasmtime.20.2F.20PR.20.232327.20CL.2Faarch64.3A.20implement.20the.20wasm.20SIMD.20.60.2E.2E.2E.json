TBH I don't have an exact code change in mind (as I said, neither Joey, nor I did anything yet because there was no real need), but having a separate boolean parameter to specify the half is probably going to be the way to do it.</p>\n<p>I dislike the ISA's approach (via the vector shape), but it has constraints (encoding space) that are not applicable to the <code>Inst</code> enum. Anyway, the <code>Inst</code> variants don't necessarily map 1:1 to machine instructions, so we can use that to improve ergonomics (e.g. we support bitwise operations on arbitrary vector shapes, not just 8-bit elements).</p>\n</blockquote>",
