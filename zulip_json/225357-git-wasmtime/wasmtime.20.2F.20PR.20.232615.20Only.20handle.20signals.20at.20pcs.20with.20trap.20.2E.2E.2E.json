This would, however, handle bugs in JIT code as-if they were wasm<br>\ntraps. Instead this commit switches signal handling to specifically<br>\ncheck for whether the precise program counter is expected to be a trap.<br>\nThis way if a program counter traps and it's not expected to trap the<br>\nsignal isn't handled and the process is aborted (presumably leading to<br>\nfurther debugging of whomever happens to work on the JIT at that time).<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
