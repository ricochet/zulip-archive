You're right yeah that the <code>vmmemory</code> method is the one that must be accurate generally, and that's why I'm thinking it'll probably be an <code>unsafe trait</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maybe it's a good idea to reorganize it? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is where I think if we could define an API in the <code>wasmtime</code> crate which we then translate to underlying layers it might be a good idea. The MemoryPlan structure is currently pretty raw and it might be best to have a layer on top of that which we specifically design for API consumption rather than JIT internals. (the example here is the <code>shared</code> flag which is ignored since it's not implemented in the internals, but we still parse it because \"one day we'll take a look at it\")</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can you elaborate a bit more on that? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A right yeah, I'm thinking of <code>wasmtime::Memory::new</code> where you should ideally be able to create a <code>wasmtime::Memory</code> with your own custom backing scheme, so you don't have to rely on these custom traits.</p>\n<p>(Ideally if we could get away with <em>only</em> updating <code>wasmtime::Memory</code> that'd be great. Then we wouldn't have to have a global config setting of \"how to allocate a wasm-defined memory, you'd only have to concern yourself with creating the right <code>wasmtime::Memory</code> structures that conform to your needs)</p>\n</blockquote>",

Memory and LinearMemory are two different concepts.<br>\nAs it is now, Memory is more of a struct which represents a (memory) inside a module.<br>\nLinearMemory is just a buffer and is way more low-level. I think that mixing them up would just create confusion. </p>\n<p>I ended up not adding Memory::new_custom thing. I don't really have a clear picture in my mind of how this should work. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something after all. The problem here is, that we want to be able to capture <em>all</em> memories created by \"create_memories\" from runtime, and current Memory interface allows to create only one. I guess, if that is what you would like to have there, I can add it like that. Let me know.<br>\nFor now please take a look and confirm if this satisfies all the crate dependency concerns you had.<br>\nThanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
