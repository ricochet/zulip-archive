Looking through the PR history since 0.25.0, though, it doesn't look like we landed any <em>major</em> user-visible feature, except for some things (SIMD tidbits on new x64 backend, macOS/aarch64) that are not relevant if one is using the old backend. (Please do let me know if I've missed something!)</p>\n<p>Given that, I think it fits the spirit of the transition plan in the RFC to take 0.25.0 as the last-good old-backend-as-default release, and just merge this after a bit more fuzzing time. Curious what others think, of course!</p>\n</blockquote>",
