It is a major undertaking to certify the safety of those implementations.</p>\n<p>ring also pulled in the wasm-bindgen family of crates for its wasm32-unknown-unknown target, which this project will not be using. Because we don't care about that platform, I added exemptions for all of these crates, so we don't have to audit them.</p>\n<p>The actual supply chain audits for rusttls, rustls-webpki, sct, and tokio-rustls were unremarkable. I also audited a small diff on wasm-bindgen-shared because it was trivial.</p>\n<p>cc #5929 </p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
