This functionality was missing from #7434.</p>\n<p>Additionally, add some functions in wasi-http for converting from hyper::Error and http::Error to the new <code>ErrorCode</code> variant. These functions log the error received as a warning, and return the translated error to the guest.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

In theory almost all error context should be made available to end users, but it seems like almost all errors are being dropped and canonicalized in bland error codes. </p>\n<p>There's not really anything that can be done about that in this PR specifically, but it might be something good to keep in mind for future iterations of wasi-http. One possible example might be something like a \"last error as debug string\" API or something like that. Or alternatively using <code>wasi:io/error.{error}</code> for all http APIs and then having an optional \"pull out the http-specific error kind from each error\" API sort of like filesystems. Too late to do this for preview2 but perhaps later.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Looking more towards the future, I wonder if it would be better to return a <code>wasi:io/error/error</code> instead of a <code>wasi:http/types/error-code</code>. @pchickey and I started working on this last week, but held off on making this change as it was not as easy as swapping out uses of <code>error-code</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
