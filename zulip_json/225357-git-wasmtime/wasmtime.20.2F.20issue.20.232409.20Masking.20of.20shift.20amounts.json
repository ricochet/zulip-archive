Currently, these semantics (which match the Wasm semantics) are enforced in the translation from Wasm to CLIF (i.e. <code>code_translator.rs</code>) and not by the compiler backends. This means that users of Cranelift are able to use shifts with the incorrect semantics.</p>\n<p>My proposed fix is to remove the masking from <code>code_translator.rs</code> and add it directly to the x64 backend--might need some help for the other backends (cc: @akirilov-arm, @cfallin). Another fix would be to change the semantics, but this seems less desirable so I don't plan to pursue it (let me know in the comments if you disagree!).</p>\n</blockquote>",
