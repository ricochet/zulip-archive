The CI gates we're requiring have \"windows-2019\" in the name whereas in this PR they switched to \"windows-latest\". To land this I'll need to switch the gates to the \"windows-latest\" version as reported in this PR. When I do that switch though all other PRs will have to rebase on this to merge since they otherwise won't have a run on \"windows-latest\" to succeed.</p>\n</blockquote>",
