This is intended to be another double-check in the process of enabling a proposal in Wasmtime by ensuring that the feature is added to this list which then transitively requires that fuzzing eventually generates a module needing that feature.</p>\n<p>cc #9449</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

That's a quick-and-easy check of \"when stabilizing make sure the feature is in this list\" because if not it doesn't check the fuzzing checkbox.</p>\n</blockquote>",
