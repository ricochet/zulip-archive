For example we could add an <code>options: option&lt;open-options&gt;</code> with a currently empty <code>resource open-options</code> or something like that.</p>\n<p>Alternatively we could add a feature to the component model and WIT for something like keyword arguments with defaults. That's a much longer- term vision though.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Then when it comes time to make a breaking change in preview 3 we can consolidate down to just one <code>open-at</code> with mode arguments.</p>\n<p>We could get fancier than that, but I expect the above will work fine without introducing much complexity.</p>\n</blockquote>",
