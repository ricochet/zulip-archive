This won't actually impact the virtual memory reserved in the pooling allocator because we already reserved 6G of virtual memory for each linear memory this instead allows access to all of it by default. This matches the default behavior of Wasmtime for the non-pooling allocator which is to not artificially limit memory by default.</p>\n<p>The main impact of this setting is that the memory-protection-keys feature, which is disabled by default, will have no effect by default unless <code>max_memory_size</code> is also configured to something smaller than 4G. The documentation has been updated to this effect.</p>\n<p>Closes #8846</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
