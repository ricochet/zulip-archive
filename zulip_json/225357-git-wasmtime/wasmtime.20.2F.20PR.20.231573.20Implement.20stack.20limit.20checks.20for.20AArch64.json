Vreg temps are allocated by the <code>LowerCtx</code>, which we've kept separate from the ABI traits, and using this will be tricky because we can't have generic methods on the <code>ABIBody</code> trait. The ordering is slightly tricky too: the <code>ABIBody</code> is created before lowering starts, so that's too early to alloc a temp, but <code>gen_prologue</code> happens late (we lower instructions in reverse order) so we can't do it there either.</p>\n<p>Suggestion: perhaps add an <code>init</code> method on the <code>ABIBody</code> trait that takes a \"just in case\" temp? (vregs are basically free, aside from creating sparsity in the ID space, so this is fine.) Then this could set <code>stack_limit</code> for use by <code>gen_prologue</code> and any calls.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The basic invariant is that <code>spilltmp</code> should only be used within a sequence of instructions generated as one unit (the original use was to compute large stackframe offsets for regalloc spills/reloads, hence the name). We should probably take an <code>into_reg</code> as an argument of <code>generate_gv</code> here, and then by implication, to <code>gen_stack_limit</code> too.</p>\n<p>(I should've added more documentation about this, sorry -- if you wouldn't mind adding a comment on <code>spilltmp_reg()</code> to this effect, that'd be very helpful, thanks!)</p>\n</blockquote>",

Given this, I think it would be fine to use <code>spilltmp</code> within <code>gen_prologue</code> itself, and then carefully validate that we don't keep it live across anything else that could implicitly use it.

The reason for this is that prologue/epilogue happens so late (way after legalization and even after register allocation) that it's difficult to share code.
