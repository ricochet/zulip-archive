But that cleanup is less clear if <code>is_root</code> is set anywhere aside from the call in <code>collect_rules</code>. So I wanted to get confirmation that this particular use of that flag is incorrect first.</p>\n<p>These two arguments (<code>is_root</code> and <code>rule_term</code>) are used to prevent expansion of a term as an internal extractor (\"macro\") if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>that term is also an internal constructor</li>\n<li>and it's the root term on the left-hand side of the current rule</li>\n<li>and the pattern we're currently translating has no parents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not sure what it should mean to use the term you're currently defining as the root pattern on the left-hand side of an if-let in the same rule, but I don't think it should have this particular special treatment.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
