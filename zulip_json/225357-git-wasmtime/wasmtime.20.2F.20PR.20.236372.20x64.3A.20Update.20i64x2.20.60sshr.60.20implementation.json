These operations are significantly more complicated without SSE 4.1, however. Comparing against LLVM's lowerings, as well, it looks like a different strategy is used which avoids extracting and inserting lanes. This commit updates to follow the strategy matched by LLVM's lowerings which additionally has the benefit of providing a non-SSE4.1 implementation.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
