Use this and plumb the result around to the various locations that require it. This improves the <code>readonly</code> application of the base pointer in Cranelift by having the optimization kick in in more scenarios. It additionally fixes combining shared linear memories with 64-bit addressing or a page size of 1 by adding a runtime check before relocation of a linear memory that it's allowed to do so.</p>\n<p>A few codegen tests are added to ensure that <code>readonly</code> is applied where it wasn't previously and additionally a new <code>*.wast</code> test was added with the cross product of various features of linear memories and some basic tests to ensure that the memories all work as expected.</p>\n<p>This refactoring fixes two preexisting issues about <code>shared</code> memories requiring a \"static\" memory style. The restriction is now based on whether the pointer can relocate or not and that's upheld via the new trait method added here.</p>\n<p>To account for these bug fixes the fuzzers have been updated to allow mixing the <code>threads</code> proposal with <code>memory64</code> or <code>custom-page-sizes</code>.</p>\n<p>Closes #4267<br>\nCloses #9523</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
