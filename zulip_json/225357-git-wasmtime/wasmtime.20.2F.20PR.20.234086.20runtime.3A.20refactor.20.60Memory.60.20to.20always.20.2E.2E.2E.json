I left the struct as <code>ExternalMemory</code> (instead of <code>StaticMemory</code>, though I can change it to that if so desired) because I started to feel that this static/dynamic nomenclature here isn't actually the most accurate. Sure, the old <code>Memory::Static</code> had a static starting address, but it turns out <code>Memory::Dynamic</code> could as well (e.g., <code>MemoryStyle::Static</code>)! Static/dynamic are rather overloaded terms anyways, so I started thinking of this structure in terms of external/internal. External memory is managed \"outside the engine\" by, e.g., the pooling allocator, and internal memory is managed directly by the engine; this mental switch helped me understand more clearly why we need more than one option here and perhaps it would be the same for others. What do you think? If you agree, I can take up this renaming in a separate PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",
