When calling to function with a different lane order, vector arguments need to be lane-swapped.  This currently happens for arguments passed in registers, but not for those passed on the stack - that is a bug.</p>\n<p>Fixed by swapping stack arguments as well.</p>\n<p>Fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8132\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8132</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
