I tested today <a href=\"https://github.com/afonso360/wasmtime/actions/runs/5164143811/jobs/9302861605\">in my own branch</a>, and it worked, and I just reran CI here and it worked again.</p>\n<p>I also tested running the CI tests on my machine and it only used ~500MB, so I'm not entirely sure what is going on. I thought we didn't run any pooling tests on CI due to QEMU issues?</p>\n<p>I'm going to tentatively merge this and if it causes issues again, we should revert it and look at it again.</p>\n</blockquote>",
