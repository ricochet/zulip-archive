ISLE's type system isn't quite sophisticated enough to do that at the moment though, as it doesn't actually know about the integral types at a built-in level (mostly); so for now the model is \"we hold 128 bits and we pass them through\". And the codegen does an explicit <code>1234i128 as &lt;ty&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;ty&gt;</code> is the user-defined primitive type. So we at least won't lose any bits that the defined primitive types would have held. So for now, indeed, it's an improvement!</p>\n</blockquote>",
