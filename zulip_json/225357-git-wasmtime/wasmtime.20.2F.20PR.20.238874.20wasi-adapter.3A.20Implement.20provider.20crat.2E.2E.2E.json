My biggest worry with this though is that there's nontrivial logic which will only get exercised once-a-month at a time and place where no one's really watching CI for failures and it's difficult to fix. Notably this is the <code>publish-to-cratesio.yml</code> workflow with logic there.</p>\n<p>The viability of this approach of synthesizing a crate on-the-fly to publish in my mind hinges on that being as simple as possible. For example the <code>sed</code> command there is duplicated with the one in <code>build-wasi-preview1-component-adapter.sh</code>. I understand why it's duplicated, but it's increasing the risk of a publish-only failure that isn't otherwise caught during development.</p>\n<p>One example is that <code>publish.rs</code> runs in \"verify\" mode on all PRs and only does publication errors later on. This has caught a significant number of errors where they would have only otherwise appeared later on during publication. </p>\n<p>I'll admit though that I'm at a bit of a loss of how best to do this. Without native support in Cargo for something like this I've never come across a great way to orchestrate this. Here's some loose thoughts though:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Could <code>publish.rs</code> perhaps be leveraged for this? That way delta in logic-on-each PR and logic-on-publish is as small as possible.</li>\n<li>I like the idea of downloading the adapter binaries as artifacts rather than rebuilding them as it guarantees they're the same as the published ones. Downloading from the tag though feels like it might be brittle and run a risk of racing with the job that's uploading artifacts per-tag. Could the artifact instead be downloaded with the <code>actions/download-artifact</code> action? Also, could the logic to download this and package it be shared with the per-PR CI too?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also ideally this could be done with a \"dry run\" of sorts to ensure that everything actually works once we hit the publication of all this. Would you be up for getting this running on your fork of Wasmtime for example? You'll probably have to comment/tweak some other things to not publish to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> for example, though.</p>\n<p>Sorry I understand I'm asking for a fair bit here. Much of this to me stems from Cargo not having native support for a feature like this and otherwise I don't think there's a non-brittle way to orchestrate this.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't have experience with workflow artefacts yet but I'll see how they work.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Could <a href=\"http://publish.rs\">publish.rs</a> perhaps be leveraged for this? That way delta in logic-on-each PR and logic-on-publish is as small as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That would be one option. Alternatively, we could have a common CI script, which is invoked in the normal CI and during publish, which downloads the artefact and does rustfmt+check+clippy+package checks (skipped during publish, so this would be a codepath that's not exercised during publish)? Then the publish action would call the same script as CI, and only the cargo publish to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> would only happen in the publish action.</p>\n<p>If <code>cargo publish --dry-run</code> can execute without credentials, we could also run that in CI as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also ideally this could be done with a \"dry run\" of sorts to ensure that everything actually works once we hit the publication of all this. Would you be up for getting this running on your fork of Wasmtime for example? You'll probably have to comment/tweak some other things to not publish to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> for example, though.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hadn't thought of this, but yes of course! In theory, adding <code>--dry-run</code> into the <a href=\"http://publish.rs\">publish.rs</a> script (and to the provider crate publish step) should be sufficient? Once we have the scripts in a good state, I'll do a run-through.</p>\n<p>I hope I can implement your ideas tomorrow and then do a test run on Friday, so there is enough time before the next publish cycle kicks off (if things take longer, we'll just take the next train)</p>\n</blockquote>",
