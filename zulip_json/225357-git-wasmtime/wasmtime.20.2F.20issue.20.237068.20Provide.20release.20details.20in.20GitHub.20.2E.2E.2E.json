The best thing to do here would probably be to copy the release notes that you've linked to the release itself, ideally automatically. Fiddling with the release process is pretty difficult though since it's difficult to test, and I suspect this'll require some well-crafted shell commands and such to get right which I'm not myself 100% sure of.</p>\n</blockquote>",
