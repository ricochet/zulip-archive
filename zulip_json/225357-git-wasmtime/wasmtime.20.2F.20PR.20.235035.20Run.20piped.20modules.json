This is fine on normal files, but on piped files(like /dev/stdin), is problematic as the header read is not visible on the next open.</p>\n<p>So, this set of commits change the procedure to 1) try to mmap the whole file from the <code>path</code>. 2) If it fails(implying the file is something special), read the whole file into the buffer so we can safely read the header and reuse the buffer again on the subsequent Module::new.</p>\n<p>The Zulip thread contains an additional concern by me, about implicitly allowing accsesing <code>/dev/tty</code> on <code>-</code> inputs, which is not considered here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
