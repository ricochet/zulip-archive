I don't want the choice to generate debuginfo or jot to influence the generated code. Gcc also doesn't let it influence the generated code. This has the advantage that enabling debuginfo doesn't change the behaviour of a program in case of UB or miscompilations, thus making them easier to debug. Finally value debuginfo may be useful for on stack replacement in case of a tiered JIT. Regressing performance in this case is unacceptable.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If someone has the time to experiment with this (I unfortunately don't at the moment, first priority is completeness for the switchover) I'd be happy to discuss or review...</p>\n</blockquote>",
