The goal here is to turn the crank and ensure that nothing else breaks as part of this release process. There's a surprising number of versions to update in-repo which we may want to make easier in the future but for now this just manually updates.</p>\n<p>It is planned that this does not actually break anyone in practice. Older runtimes should support newer versions and Wasmtime after this PR should continue to support older binaries as well.</p>\n<p>Put another way this should not break things and if it does this will get reverted and fixed. We've done our best to make sure this won't break things, so let's find out in the real world now.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
