With addition and multiplication, there's often hardware support for detecting overflow as a side effect of the computation. But with shifts I don't think we can generate code that's any better than you'd get from explicitly writing something like <code>icmp uge shift_amt, 64</code> for the overflow output of an I64 shift, right?</p>\n</blockquote>",

AFAIK the shift instructions at least on x86-64 and aarch64 have native wrapping behavior. So I agree there's no real reason to expect we could do any better. Given that I guess I'll close this but if new arguments for these ops arise, we can always reconsider!</p>\n</blockquote>",
