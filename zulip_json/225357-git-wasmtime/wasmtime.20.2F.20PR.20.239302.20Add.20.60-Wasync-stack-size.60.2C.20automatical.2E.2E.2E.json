Previously the CLI provided no means to configure the async stack size, however, which now means that when increasing the max wasm stack the CLI prints an error that cannot be resolved about the wasm stack being larger than the async stack. This commit fixes this issue by both adding a configuration option for the async stack size and additionally automatically increasing the async stack size when only the wasm stack size is provided.</p>\n<p>Closes #9298</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
