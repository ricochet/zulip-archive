This covers most of the MVP functionality of wasm for example and additionally exercises 8 and 16-bit lowerings for many instructions. A few minor pulley instructions were added and otherwise new 8/16-bit lowerings use existing instructions. It's expected that the 8/16-bit lowerings won't be used all that often so they're not particularly optimal at this time.</p>\n<p>Some CLIF tests were omitted such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most SIMD-using CLIF tests</li>\n<li>Float/int conversion tests using 8 and 16-bit integers</li>\n<li>Tests with <code>call</code> instructions as relocations don't work with the JIT crate on Pulley</li>\n<li>Tests using 128-bit integers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Support for some of these tests may be enabled in the future, but for example 8/16-bit integers may not get used much.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
