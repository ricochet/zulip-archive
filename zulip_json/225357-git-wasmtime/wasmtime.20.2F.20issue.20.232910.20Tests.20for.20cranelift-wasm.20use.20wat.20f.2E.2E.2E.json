Aside from the growth in size, it doesn't require us to publish a data-only crate, and it doesn't create a weird non-deterministic testing dependence on the filesystem outside the crate's root. We could eventually opt to split the tests out as a separate piece of infrastructure, however packaging them as part of the crate now doesn't prevent us from doing that later.</p>\n<p>So: I'd be happy to review a PR that just moves the directory and alters the path in the testsuite driver. Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
