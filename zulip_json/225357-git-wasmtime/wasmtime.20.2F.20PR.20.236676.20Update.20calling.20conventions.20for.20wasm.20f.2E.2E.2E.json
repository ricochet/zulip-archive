This was an accidental omission from #6649 where the conclusion was that s390x will continue using a calling convention with little-endian lane order for lane arguments. The only calling convention that supports this today is <code>WasmtimeSystemV</code>, although the <code>Tail</code> calling convention will likely use it in the future as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Second the apple-aarch64 platform now uses the <code>Fast</code> calling convention instead of <code>AppleAarch64</code> calling convention. That convention was specified in #4195 but local testing shows that is not necessary in the sense that tests all pass with the <code>Fast</code> calling convention. This means that the prior comment why the <code>AppleAarch64</code> calling convention is required is no longer accurate and in the absence of a reason not to I went ahead and switched it to <code>Fast</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the near future all wasm functions will unconditionally use the <code>Tail</code> calling convention and at that time the lane order can be specified on s390x to be little-endian to satisfy all the constraints here. Additionally any unwinding directives, if necessary for aarch64, can be specified as needed.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
