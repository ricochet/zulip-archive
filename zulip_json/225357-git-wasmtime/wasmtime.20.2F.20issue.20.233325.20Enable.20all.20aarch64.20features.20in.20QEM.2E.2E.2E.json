Our test suite triggers lots of segfaults which end up being caught, so I'm not sure if QEMU is printing the segfault and then we catch it or what. Also QEMU doesn't entirely exit because the test suite keeps running, so if it all runs to completion I'm not sure what the segfault message is actually pointing to.</p>\n</blockquote>",
