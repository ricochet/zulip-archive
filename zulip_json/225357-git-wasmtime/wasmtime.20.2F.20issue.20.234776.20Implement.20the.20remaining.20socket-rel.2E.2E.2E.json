The wasm module creates a listener via the wasi api and calls accept().</p>\n<p>Sometime later, while wasm module is still waiting on <code>accept</code>, the host wants to stop the module. It can't directly call <code>sock_shutdown</code> because neither TcpListen nor Socket are cloneable, so it can't hold onto a cloned object to call shutdown on it later. If the host kept the u32 file descriptor, it could either recreate a Socket from the fd and call sock_shutdown, or pass the fd to a low-level unix function to close it, which seems extremely non-portable. There is a try_clone and if it succeeds it creates an alias file descriptor, but it's not clear from the documentation if it would work for this purpose.</p>\n<p>What is the recommended method of closing a socket in this scenario? <br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
