We only care that if its value result is used, then it's computed without branching on the condition input. We don't otherwise care when the value is computed, or if it's computed at all.</p>\n<p>Second, introduce some carefully selected ISLE egraph rewrites for this instruction. These particular rewrites are those where we can statically determine which SSA value will be the result of the instruction. Since there is no actual choice involved, there's no way to accidentally introduce a branch on the condition input.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In particular:<ul>\n<li>The instruction definition's description still says the op is guaranteed not to be removed. That's not true anymore (in fact that's the point of this PR!); can we update to say something about not picking the wrong input even under a mis-speculated branch (as you do in the comment in the ISLE rewrites)?</li>\n<li>Let's note in the ISLE rewrites that removing <code>select_spectre_guard</code>, if semantically correct for the functional result, always meets this speculation condition: by removing an op we are only ever going to remove computation that could be speculated, we're never adding new speculation.</li>\n<li>Finally, can we add a comment in around the instruction description noting that the op is pure because our reasoning about speculation safety tells us it's always safe to remove if functionally correct, and safe to merge with another functionally identical op.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
