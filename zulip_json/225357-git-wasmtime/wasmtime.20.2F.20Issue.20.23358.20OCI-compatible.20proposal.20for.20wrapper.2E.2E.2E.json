I think we are going to start holding public Zoom meetings in the next few weeks, since we've gotten to this point where we are doing lots and lots of one-off calls that would better be served by a community dev chat sorta thing.</p>\n<p>We did a CRI implementation as well, and started work on a containerd shim, but hit up against design trade-offs that we did not like. So we went back to implementing a kubelet that viewed WASM as its first-class runtime. There has been some talk about attempting to re-visit CRI (and maybe do a CRI v2) to make it less OCI/Docker-centric (it makes _really_ strong assumptions about the runtime). But that is probably a 2+ year project. Krustlet is, for us, a chance to try to solve the problem today.</p>\n<p>Since @radu-matei  wrote his post last November, we've also been pretty successful storing WASM modules in at least some OCI registries. That route is looking promising.</p>\n</blockquote>",
