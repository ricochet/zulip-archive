These layouts are somewhat image specific (e.g., NHWC = Number of images in a batch, Height in pixels, Width in pixels, number of Color channels) so their inclusion in the wasi-nn specification is dubious, since it should handle any kind of inference. OpenVINO expects some early configuration of this layout, though; currently the <code>NHWC</code> layout is forced as a sane default, but <a href=\"https://docs.rs/openvino/latest/openvino/enum.Layout.html\">other layouts are possible</a>. To handle any kind of input layout, the OpenVINO backend could: 1) find another way of passing in the layout (i.e., upstream spec changes) or 2) avoid OpenVINO pre-processing that requires the layout (e.g., by using <code>ANY</code>). </p>\n</blockquote>",
