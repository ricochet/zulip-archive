All files are copied to a <code>tests/disas/winch</code> folder.</p>\n<p>This PR has a number of commit splitting out the various stages of this migration. The main changes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>test = \"winch\"</code> is now supported in <code>disas</code> tests</li>\n<li>Support for the Winch ABI in Cranelift is ungated (it no longer panics) to get <code>wasmtime compile</code> working to get the tests working</li>\n<li>Winch tests now use ATT syntax instead of Intel syntax (the Cranelift default)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next follow-up I'd like to do is to remove the filetest infrastructure for Winch, which will probably also remove the Winch executable itself. I'll do that as a follow-up though.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I was a bit confused as to why the address after a jump instruction was printed because that didn't account for fall-through-style jumps (e.g. it didn't reliably catch all jump targets). For after-ret I was also not sure that would handle the case of multiple <code>ret</code> instructions in a function. </p>\n<p>I can add it back in though if desired!</p>\n</blockquote>",
