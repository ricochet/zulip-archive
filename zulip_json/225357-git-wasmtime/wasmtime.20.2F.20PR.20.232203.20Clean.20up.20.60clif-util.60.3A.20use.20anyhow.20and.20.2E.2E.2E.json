That would feel a bit better than holding a bare <code>CodegenError</code> and recombining it with its context here.</p>\n<p>(On second thought, this would force us to plumb lifetime params through in order to carry the func/isa borrows -- maybe too verbose. Maybe there's something else in that spirit though. Needs more thought?)</p>\n</blockquote>",
