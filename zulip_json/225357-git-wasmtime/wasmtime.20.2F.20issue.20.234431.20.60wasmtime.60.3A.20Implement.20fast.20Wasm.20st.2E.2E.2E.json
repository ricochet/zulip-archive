In my mind, a _frame pointer_, i.e. a reserved register separate from the stack pointer, which is being using by generated code to access local variables, spill slots, and other objects in a function's stack frame, is only ever necessary if those objects cannot be accessed relative to the stack pointer instead.  This is normally only the case if the function performs dynamic stack space allocation (the C <code>alloca</code> or some equivalent), because then you no longer know at compile time what the offset of your stack frame objects relative to the stack pointer is. </p>\n<p>Given that there is no dynamic stack allocation in Cranelift, I do not think maintaining an actual frame pointer register is <em>ever</em> needed for <em>any</em> architecture, so I do not understand why the Intel and Arm back-ends are currently doing so.  I would expect that as optimization of Cranelift proceeds, we would want to re-examine that choice - I believe unnecessarily maintaining a frame pointer does cost a noticable performance overhead.  Note that this overhead is not (or not <em>only</em>) due to the extra saves and restores in prolog and epilog, but primarily due to the fact that we've blocked one whole register that we could have used freely for register allocation otherwise.</p>\n<p>I do understand that, once we <em>do</em> maintain a frame pointer register, there are ancillary benefits for stack walking, since the frame pointer must be callee-saved, and the saved copies of that register on the stack happen to form a nice chain that can be easily walked to perform a simple backtrace.  However, as soon as we enforce maintaining a frame pointer <em>just</em> for that purpose, this is not actually \"free\", but does incur the runtime overhead described above, which would otherwise be unnecessary.  I think there may be alternative solutions for the debugging problem without that overhead ...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So I guess our options are to</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>1. preserve frame pointers in s390x (or equivalent; unsure what you meant by &quot;or equivalent of&quot; since I&#39;m not very familiar with s390x nor its calling conventions),\n\n2. continue to depend on the `backtrace` crate and the system unwinder on s390x, or\n\n3. write a custom stack walker for s390x that is not based on frame pointers (and is instead based on...

Basically, the backchain link is formed by prolog code storing a pointer to the caller's stack frame into the lowest word of the callee's stack frame - and that's it, there is no frame pointer register reserved throughout the function.</p>\n<p>Now, we decided more than 20 years ago to even switch <em>this</em> feature off by default in the Linux toolchains, because with DWARF CFI it is no longer needed for debugging, and even that simple store has measurable overhead.  (It is still used in special circumstances, e.g. in Linux kernel code.)   But I could certainly enable that feature for Cranelift in the s390x back end.</p>\n<p>That said, this would still leave us with the problem of frameless leaf functions, just like in the Arm case.  I could also force any function that contains a trap to always allocate a frame anyway, just so we can store the backchain and the return address.   But that would be even further run-time overhead ...</p>\n<p>There may be a more elegant solution to the frameless leaf function problem, also for Arm.   Once we know we are currently in a frameless leaf function, this is actually simple to handle: to unwind from a leaf function, you only need to notice that the caller's SP equals the current SP, and the caller's PC equals the value currently in the link register.  (Assuming you have one; on Intel you'd get the return address from the lowest word of the stack instead.)</p>\n<p>The only difficulty is to know whether we <em>are</em> in a frameless leaf function or not.  But we should (be able to) know that - after all, we did compile that function ourselves earlier on :-)   So, assuming we can associate the current PC with a data structure identifying the function (which I believe we must do anyway to get at the function <em>name</em> - which is the whole point of generating stack backtraces in the first place), the only thing we'd need to do is to have the compiler set a flag in that structure that this function is frameless.</p>\n<p>In fact, spinning that thought experiment a bit further: if we'd store not just a \"frameless\" flag, but the actual _size_ of the stack frame, we should be able to use that information to unwind from non-leaf functions as well without requiring any explicit backchain or frame pointer: just compute the caller's SP as the callee's SP plus the callee's (known) stack frame size.   Note that this makes explicit use of the fact that frame sizes in Cranelift are constants known at compile time, because there is no dynamic stack allocation.   (Glossing over some details here; this assumes that the stack pointer doesn't change at all during function execution, at least not at the \"relevant\" places - traps and function call sites.  This is true on s390x and -as far as I know- on Arm, but not on Intel.  There'd be extra information required to handle Intel correctly.)<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

In fact, we've had problems with system unwinders before where they fail to fully walk the stack and if we fully trusted the system unwinder we would have exactly these use-after-free bugs! This was the motivation for the \"stack canary\" infrastructure that Wasmtime has in <code>main</code> now (and is obsoleted in this PR).</p>\n<p>Frame pointers are a local property of compiling a single function that Cranelift can make sure are preserved and it is hard to get wrong.</p>\n<p>Side tables on the other hand are more of a global property of all of the module's compilation and we also have to make sure that the runtime is interpreting and doing lookup in the table correctly. It isn't hard to have bugs with this kind of global integration between two far away components, as we've seen with multiple stack map-related CVEs.</p>\n<p>This is why I've been pursuing frame pointers rather than side table metadata, even though I am aware that frame pointers are not strictly necessary (outside of ABI constraints) and impose some overhead (which we already happen to be paying on our most-used backends).</p>\n</blockquote>",

I agree stack walking must be correct - that's the same in the DWARF CFI case, which is used e.g. for C++ exception handling, which also must always be correct.

I think there are two <code>s390x</code> TODO items here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] Implement frame pointers preservation. I've split out <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4469\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4469</a> to add a new flag for Cranelift that controls whether a backend should preserve frame pointers (or equivalent). I think that PR can land without <code>s390x</code> support, since all tests will all still pass, and then we can add <code>s390x</code> support in a follow up PR and add the equivalent filetests for <code>s390x</code> that I added for <code>aarch64</code> in that PR.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] Create <code>s390x</code> implementations of the host-to-Wasm and Wasm-to-host trampolines in <code>crates/runtime/src/trampolines/s390x.rs</code>. I don't think I have enough <code>s390x</code> expertise to implement this myself, but I can definitely help clear up any questons around <em>what</em> the trampolines should do, and why they have the constraints that they do.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More than happy to wait until your SIMD patch is merged.</p>\n<p>As already mentioned, I think we can merge the new preserve-frame-pointers flag PR as soon as it gets review approval and CI is green, since it doesn't break anything by itself yet.</p>\n<p>But I'd really prefer to not land this PR -- since doing so would break <code>s390x</code> support in Wasmtime -- until we've resolved both the frame pointers item and the trampolines item. Do you think this is something you can help out with within the next couple weeks? I'd prefer not to keep this PR open indefinitely, so if you are swamped and don't have the time, then we could consider the temporarily disabling <code>s390x</code> in CI until we can get it working again, but I would personally consider this an unfortunate outcome.</p>\n<p>But yeah, I consider this PR to be pretty stable and generally ready for review now, so I don't think it makes sense to wait on it to be more fleshed out anymore.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Some quick benchmarking locally shows that <code>Instance::runtime_limits</code> is not inlined across crates, for example, but provides a small perf boost if it is (and it wasn't necessary before this commit).</p>\n<p>Additionally logic added <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4431/commits/4d8486dec7da8c1c7751f6f5d5801fbf9896563c\">in the latest commit</a> greatly inflates the size of the return value which may not be easily optimizable (moving large-ish types around in Rust) and might be better modeled with a <code>Drop for SomeCustomStruct</code> to handle the unwind cleanup rather than deferring the <code>resume_unwind</code>.</p>\n<p>I mostly just want to make sure that the slowdowns all come from expected sources. The extra indirect calls are expected to be slower along with the extra memory traffic of maintaining  pc/fp along with all the old pc/fp/etc. Additionally the stack frame for <code>catch_trap</code> is bigger with a bigger <code>CallThreadState</code> so the extra memory traffic in that function is also expected.</p>\n</blockquote>",
