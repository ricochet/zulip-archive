Also mind adding some API tests that <code>hash_key</code> is the same value if, for example, a global is extracted twice?</p>\n<p>Hm as I say this <code>Func</code> doesn't implement <code>hash_key</code> either, so the \"inconsistency\" of tables not implementing it may be ok. Could <code>Func</code> implement it too though?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Opted not to do this in this PR. If you feel strongly I can do it in a follow up.</p>\n<p>But nothing would actually use these new methods, so we would have to <code>#[allow(unused)]</code> which feels pretty bleh just for aesthetic consistency. They are super easy methods to add, should we ever need them. Just a couple line copy paste.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This line of thinking applies to all small changes, though, so it's not necessarily great in that respect.</p>\n</blockquote>",
