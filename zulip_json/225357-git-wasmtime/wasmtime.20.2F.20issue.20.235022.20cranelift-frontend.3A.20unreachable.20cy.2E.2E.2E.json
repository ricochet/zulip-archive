In the end I think we started to converge on a viewpoint that accepting unreachable code in general creates edge-cases such as this whose resulting complexity may not be worth handling.</p>\n<p>From the IR-consumer perspective, handling only inputs with reachable blocks is unambiguously easier: it avoids cases like the one in this issue, and has other nice properties too (one knows for sure that a traversal from the entry will reach all code, etc).</p>\n<p>From the IR-producer perspective, it can be somewhat annoying to face this requirement: it seems at odds with a compiler that otherwise accepts arbitrary unoptimized code and promises to optimize it. (Dead code is a kind of unoptimized code!) But it seems a little bit different to me than other sorts of unoptimized code (in a way that's hard to describe exactly, but I'll note that e.g. <code>cranelift-wasm</code> goes to some lengths to handle unreachable program points specially).</p>\n<p>In my experience with regalloc2, as well, accepting unreachable code created a ton of issues and in the end I imposed the requirement that input blocks are reachable. Cranelift already provided this property in its lowered code (even with opts turned off) but this created issues in the fuzz testcase generator. IIUC, this and related issues are being discovered by cranelift-fuzzgen.</p>\n<p>My solution in regalloc2's case was to design the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/regalloc2/blob/6394913c1def401691333a60c39e740f7dd08092/src/fuzzing/func.rs#L321-L326\">fuzz testcase generator</a> in a way that produces reachable code by construction: we construct a \"spine\" and then create arbitrary branches (forward or back) along that spine. This can, I think, create any CFG shape that we want to test, and also can be configured to produce either reducible control flow only, or allow irreducible backedges. I might suggest taking an approach like this in cranelift-fuzzgen too. An alternative would be to simply reject inputs with unreachable blocks (i.e. silently accept / bail out early) but that probably would have significant impact on fuzzing efficiency.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Then there are two definitions reaching the phi node, so it can't be removed.</p>\n<p>Also: One of the approaches that Chris and I had discussed was for cranelift-frontend to raise an error if <code>use_var</code> gets called in a block that isn't _currently_ reachable, even if predecessors could be added later that make it reachable. That general idea may turn out to be too restrictive even for Wasmtime. I noticed this week that cranelift-wasm constructs a single exit block for the function before translating the body of the function, and I think it does the same with blocks following conditionals and loops.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure exactly what invariant we need in SSA construction, so it's hard to say whether we can check that invariant incrementally without breaking reasonable frontends. But we can at least get fuzzgen to not trigger this bug, so that's still worth doing.</p>\n</blockquote>",
