We've had two issues lately that came up which led to this proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3915\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/3915</a> it was realized that changes just before the 0.35.0 release<br>\n  weren't enough for an embedding use case, but the PR didn't meet the<br>\n  expectations for a full patch release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At Fastly we were about to start rolling out a new version of Wasmtime<br>\n  when over the weekend the fuzz bug <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3951\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/3951</a> was found. This led to the<br>\n  desire internally to have a \"must have been fuzzed for this long\"<br>\n  period of time for Wasmtime changes which we felt were better<br>\n  reflected in the release process itself rather than something about<br>\n  Fastly's own integration with Wasmtime.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This commit updates the automation for releases to unconditionally<br>\ncreate a <code>release-X.Y.Z</code> branch on the 5th of every month. The actual<br>\nrelease from this branch is then performed on the 20th of every month,<br>\nroughly two weeks later. This should provide a period of time to ensure<br>\nthat all changes in a release are fuzzed for at least two weeks and<br>\navoid any further surprises. This should also help with any last-minute<br>\nchanges made just before a release if they need tweaking since<br>\nbackporting to a not-yet-released branch is much easier.</p>\n<p>Overall there are some new properties about Wasmtime with this proposal<br>\nas well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>main</code> branch will always have a section in <code>RELEASES.md</code> which is<br>\n  listed as \"Unreleased\" for us to fill out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>main</code> branch will always be a version ahead of the latest<br>\n  release. For example it will be bump pre-emptively as part of the<br>\n  release process on the 5th where if <code>release-2.0.0</code> was created then<br>\n  the <code>main</code> branch will have 3.0.0 Wasmtime.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dates for major versions are automatically updated in the<br>\n<code>RELEASES.md</code> notes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The associated documentation for our release process is updated and the<br>\nvarious scripts should all be updated now as well with this commit.</p>\n</blockquote>",
