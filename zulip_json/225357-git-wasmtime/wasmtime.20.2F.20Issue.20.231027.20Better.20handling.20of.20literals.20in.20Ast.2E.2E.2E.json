As a result, we'd like to be able to match a different transform to a concrete piece of rtl, depending on the value of some of the immediate fields. To enable this we need several things:</p>\n<p>0. A base class for all Literals - current (Enumerator, ConstantInt) and future (FlagSet)<br>\n   1. Support substitutions Var-&gt;Literal, Literal-&gt;Var (requires changes to {Ast, Def,Rtl}.{copy, substitution}<br>\n   2. Change verify_semantics() to enumerate all concrete values of enumerable immediates on top of enumerating all concrete typings.</p>\n</blockquote>",
