If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;<br>\nWe can enable more of the <code>misc_testsuite</code> to run with the Winch compilation. I've listed the currently failing tests as a deny list. Most of them require SIMD support or Reference Types support to be implemented before they'll be able to pass. <code>func_400_params</code> is the exception and requires an update to Winch to accommodate additional parameters.</p>\n</blockquote>",
