This is probably not the right solution for merges into release branches that are actually carrying multiple logically separate changes around; if I had to cherrypick multiple PRs into the point release then it would seem wrong to squash them together; cc @tschneidereit to think more about this / perhaps see if we can have the restriction only on <code>main</code>?</p>\n<p>In any case, for forward progress, I'll go ahead and merge this.</p>\n</blockquote>",
