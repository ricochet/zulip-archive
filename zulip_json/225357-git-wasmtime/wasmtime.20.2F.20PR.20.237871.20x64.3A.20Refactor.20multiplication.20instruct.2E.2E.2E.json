The goal of this commit was to refactor scalar multiplication-related instructions in the x64 backend to more closely align with their native instructions. Changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>MulHi</code> instruction is renamed to <code>Mul</code>. This represents either <code>mul</code> or <code>imul</code> producing a doublewide result.</li>\n<li>A <code>Mul8</code> instruction was added to correspond to <code>Mul</code> for the 8-bit variants that produce a doublewide result in the <code>AX</code> register rather than the other instructions which split between <code>RAX</code> and <code>RDX</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>UMulLo</code> instruction was removed as now it's covered by <code>Mul</code></li>\n<li>The <code>AluRmiROpcode::Mul</code> opcode was removed in favor of new <code>IMul</code> and <code>IMulImm</code> instructions. Register allocation and emission already had special cases for <code>Mul</code> which felt better as standalone instructions rather than putting in an existing variant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lowerings using <code>imul</code> are not affected in general but the <code>IMulImm</code> instruction has different register allocation behavior than before which allows the destination to have a different register than the first operand. The <code>umulhi</code> and <code>smulhi</code> instructions are also reimplemented with their 8-bit variants instead of extension-plus-16-bit variants.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
