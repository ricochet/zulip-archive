I didn't realize this had a conflict.</p>\n<p>There is an  additional question that I'd like to ask for opinions. After this PR (as it is) we have two flags, <code>enable_probestack</code> and <code>probestack_strategy</code>. Should we merge those flags by adding a <code>disabled</code> arm to <code>probestack_strategy</code>?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think this is the right approach. I didn't look closely at the emission code but the sequence in the comments seems reasonable, as does the unrolled-vs-looping optimization.</p>\n</blockquote>",
