This means that the interfaces supported by <code>wasmtime serve</code> are the same as <code>wasmtime run</code> by default.</p>\n<p>To fully implement this there's a number of refactorings here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>More flags like <code>--dir</code> and <code>--env</code> are moved into <code>RunCommon</code> to be shared between <code>wasmtime serve</code> and <code>wasmtime run</code>, meaning that the <code>serve</code> command can now configure environment variables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A small test has been added as well as infrastructure for running tests with <code>wasmtime serve</code> itself. Previously there were no tests that executed <code>wasmtime serve</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>test_programs</code> crate had a small refactoring to avoid double-generation of http bindings.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Closes #8086</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
