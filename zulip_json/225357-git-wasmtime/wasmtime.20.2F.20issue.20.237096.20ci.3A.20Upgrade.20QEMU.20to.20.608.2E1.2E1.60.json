That may or may not be a bug in QEMU but because the behavior changed it's probably a niche bugfix or something like that. I can confirm locally on aarch64 though that the test passes, so it may be a cpu-specific thing or something like that.</p>\n<p>In any case it may be best to update the test to simply not test that the exact faulting address is reported. It's already different for s390x anyway, so if we additionally have to update it for aarch64  that may mean it's unreasonable to expect to be able to test that.</p>\n</blockquote>",
