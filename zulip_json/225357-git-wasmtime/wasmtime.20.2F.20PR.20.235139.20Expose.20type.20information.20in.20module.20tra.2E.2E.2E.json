This change is useful when consumers want to have access to the type information in wasmparser's terms rather than in wasmtime_environ's equivalent types (e.g. <code>WasmFuncType</code>).</p>\n<p>I went with the simplest approach, wrapping the <code>Types</code> with <code>Option</code>, and introducing a method to get the types to preserve the invariant that after a successful translation, types should always be available. But I also considered some alternatives, so I'm happy to change this if any of the other alternatives are preferred.</p>\n<p>Other alternatives considered:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Making <code>wasmparser::types::Types</code> derive <code>Default</code>.  To achieve this, <code>wasmparser::validator::types::TypesKind</code>, should also need to derive <code>Default</code>, and the question that pops up here is, which is a good default for <code>TypesKind</code>? We could go with either or, but I'm not convinced that semantically it makes sense, IMO if we're going this route, it probably makes more sense to have an extra entry to represent the \"untyped\" state. </li>\n<li>Introduce a module translation builder of some sort, and use that instead of <code>ModuleTranslation</code> for the translation/validation process. This would allow avoiding the <code>Option</code>, but seems a lot of duplication for a single field. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.
