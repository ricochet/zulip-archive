Previously the small trampolines in Cranelift were compiled with the native host calling convention and this commit instead changes them to the wasm calling convention (e.g. \"tail\"). This helps keep caller/callee matched with calling conventions in wasm code itself and shifts the boundary of the wasm-&gt;host transition to the indirect call of the host function pointer itself. The general hope is that this makes Pulley a bit easier since it'll want to minimize handling of wasm-&gt;host transitions.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
