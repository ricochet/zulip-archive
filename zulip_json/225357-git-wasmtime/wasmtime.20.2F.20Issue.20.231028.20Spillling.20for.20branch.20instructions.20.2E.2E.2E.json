The problem is the global values live across the branch into the destination EBB. These values can't be temporarily moved because the destination EBB expects them in their global registers.</p>\n<p>Normally, the spiller will make sure that there are enough free registers for the branch instruction's own operands, but it can't guarantee that there are registers free in a constrained register class.</p>\n<p>An example is an Intel <code>brnz.b1</code> instruction whose controlling <code>b1</code> operand is constrained to the ABCD register class. We can't currently guarantee the live-ins for the destination EBB are not taking up the whole ABCD register class.</p>\n</blockquote>",
