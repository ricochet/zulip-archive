This is because <code>serde</code> can then compile in parallel to <code>serde_derive</code>, allowing it to finish compilation possibly even before <code>serde_derive</code>, unblocking all the crates waiting for <code>serde</code> to start compiling much sooner.</p>\n<p>As it turns out the main deciding factor for how long the compile time of a project is, is primarly determined by the depth of dependencies rather than the width. In other words, a crate's compile times aren't affected by how many crates it depends on, but rather by the longest chain of dependencies that it needs to wait on. In many cases <code>serde</code> is part of that long chain, as it is part of a long chain if the <code>derive</code> feature is active:</p>\n<p><code>proc-macro2</code> compile build script &gt; <code>proc-macro2</code> run build script &gt; <code>proc-macro2</code> &gt; <code>quote</code> &gt; <code>syn</code> &gt; <code>serde_derive</code> &gt; <code>serde</code> &gt; <code>serde_json</code> (or any crate that depends on serde)</p>\n<p>By decoupling it from <code>serde_derive</code>, the chain is shortened and compile times get much better.</p>\n<p>Check this issue for a deeper elaboration:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2584\">https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2584</a></p>\n<p>For <code>wasmtime</code> I'm seeing a reduction from 24.75s to 22.45s when compiling in <code>release</code> mode. This is because wasmtime through <code>gimli</code> has a dependency on <code>indexmap</code> which can only start compiling when <code>serde</code> is finished, which you want to happen as early as possible so some of wasmtime's dependencies can start compiling.</p>\n<p>To measure the full effect, the dependencies can't by themselves activate the <code>derive</code> feature. I've upstreamed a patch for <code>fxprof-processed-profile</code> which was the only dependency that activated it for <code>wasmtime</code> (not yet published to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>). <code>wasmtime-cli</code> and co. may need patches for their dependencies to see a similar improvement.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
