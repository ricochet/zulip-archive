Merging them will allow us to remove these hacks.</p>\n<p>The next step after this, before actually merging the crates together, is to factor out <code>wasmtime_runtime::{sys,mmap,mmap_vec}</code> into its own crate, since this functionality is used directly by the CLI in one place, and I don't want to add that stuff to the <code>wasmtime</code> crate's public API.</p>\n</blockquote>",
