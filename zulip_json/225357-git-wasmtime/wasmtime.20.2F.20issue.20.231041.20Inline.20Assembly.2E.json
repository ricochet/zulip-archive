As outlined by sunfishcode above, this is a big design question, so any effort should probably start with an RFC; and then the implementation effort would probably be 3-6 months of fulltime work, I would estimate. Currently none of the core developers have the time/resources to build this, so it would likely have to come from a motivated contributor.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I just read how Cland and LLVM handles inline assembly and I find it maybe useful towards the end goal:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/MeB7Dp3G2UE?si=2boJuSqM-JLH2f7o&amp;t=510\">https://youtu.be/MeB7Dp3G2UE?si=2boJuSqM-JLH2f7o&amp;t=510</a></p>\n<p>Basically, LLVM is also treating the inline assembly as string, replace the parameters, captures used registers and feed it to the register allocator, and then insert the output assembly at the specific point. I'm not sure if I missed something.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'd recommend reading sunfishcode's comment above (and really, this whole thread): there are a huge number of complexities here that need to be fully appreciated and handled in any robust solution.</p>\n<p>As one example, we currently generate machine code directly, rather than using any existing assembler at the backend. And our machine-code representation is close but not exactly 1-to-1 with instructions, and we don't have representations for instructions we don't use. So at the very least, such a project would require (i) writing a new textual assembler that uses our emission backend, or adopting an existing assembler library in Rust to work with our backend and provide the same interface and metadata to the register allocator, and (ii) extending our instruction representation to support all known CPU instructions. That's an enormous effort.</p>\n<p>To state it more explicitly: the input that is most needed here is not ideas or brainstorming or problem-solving, nor confirmation that this is a useful feature; we have plenty of ideas, and we know this is a useful feature that some people want. The input that is needed is <em>human time</em> to actually develop the feature; something like 3-6 months of fulltime engineering. Cranelift is developed by folks who use it for various applications, and we're all quite busy, and don't have the free time for that. Anyone who does, and is sufficiently motivated to need this feature, is welcome to help out!</p>\n</blockquote>",
