After observing that a recent regression creeped in into a stable release of wasmtime on Mac M1 (that happens in software engineering!), we at Embark Studios have decided that we needed to help with a stopgap solution to set up some CI on Mac M1, without fiddling with Github actions runner.</p>\n<p>And here it is! Wasmtime is now being daily tested on an in-house Mac M1, as part of this public repository's CI: <a href=\"https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/wasmtime-aarch64-apple-darwin\">https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/wasmtime-aarch64-apple-darwin</a><br>\nWhile not running on every single commit, it should help us identify new test failures and notice regressions a bit quicker!</p>\n</blockquote>",
