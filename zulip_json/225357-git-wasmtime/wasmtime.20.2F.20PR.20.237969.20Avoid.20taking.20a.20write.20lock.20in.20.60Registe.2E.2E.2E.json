Once that is done, we have the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>RegisteredType::root</code> only needs a read lock, not a write lock.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>RegisteredType::clone</code>, which used to need a write lock, doesn't need any locking anymore.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>RegisteredType::drop</code> doesn't need any locking most of the time. The exception is when this is this drop that moves the refcount to zero, in which case grabbing a write lock is still necessary to remove the type from the registry.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
