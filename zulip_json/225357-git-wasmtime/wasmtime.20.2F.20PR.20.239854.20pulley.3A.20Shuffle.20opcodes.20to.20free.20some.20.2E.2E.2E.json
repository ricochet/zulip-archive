To help bridge this gap in the interim shuffle all float/vector-related opcodes into the \"extended\" opcode namespace. This frees up a large chunk of the 1-byte opcode namespace for future expansion with extensions like above.</p>\n<p>I'll note that I'm not 100% sure that the opcodes will all stay here after this reshuffling. I haven't done any profiling/performance analysis to gauge the impact of this change. The immediate goal is to start experimenting with non-float/vector programs and get them profiling well. This will require more \"macro opcodes\" such as new addressing modes and opcodes-with-immediates. These are expected to be relatively hot opcodes and thus probably want to be in the \"fast\" 1-byte namespace, hence the shuffling here.</p>\n<p>My plan is to in the future do a bit of an evaluation with a float/vector program and see whether it make sense to shuffle some of them into this 1-bytecode space as well. More radically it might make sense to remove the split between ops/extended ops and instead just have a 2-byte opcode space entirely. That's all left for future evaluations though.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

The recursive definition required upping <code>#[recursion_limit]</code> which I'd prefer to not do. In lieu of fancier <code>macro_rules!</code> features which will make this nicer in the future I opted to have a chain of <code>1 + 1 + ...</code> for each opcode name. That requires using <code>$name</code> in the repetition somewhere though so I came up with this funky way of always evaluating to <code>1</code> but still using <code>$name</code> somehow. </p>\n</blockquote>",
