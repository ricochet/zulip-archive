Much of that is due to crates that build/link native code, but some of it is also the fact that some of the functions in <code>std</code> are present but panic when called. I'm wondering just how bad an idea it'd be to omit the functions we don't support, rather than having them fail at runtime, so that these would be compile-time failures instead?</p>",
