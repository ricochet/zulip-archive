As the comment says, <em>The only way to change that behavior would be to rewrite wasmtime-wasi with a completely different internal architecture, to solely use synchronous Rust.</em> That's exactly what I want. Obviously you cannot use real http connections, but everything else should be doable in sync Rust. I am willing to do the rewrite, the only question is if that PR would be accepted. If not, I can always release it as a separate crate called <code>wasmtime-wasi-sync</code> or something, if you don't have a problem with <code>wasmtime</code> being in the name even though it is not from the wasmtime team.</p>",
