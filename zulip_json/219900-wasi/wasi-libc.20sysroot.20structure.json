We are only using one of these at a time?</p>\n<p>Besides, I've been trying to implement my own libc for wasm, and I build my own sysroot with only <code>write</code> syscall and <code>stpcpy</code> string function, it worked where I use llvm-ar to put a minimal libc.o and stpcpy.o into a <code>libc.a</code> file. So I suppose the libc.a file is actually the core of a wasm sysroot? Then why there's still a <code>libc.so</code> inside wasi-sdk's <code>sysroot/lib/wasm32-wasi/</code>?  Is a <code>libc.a</code> along enough?</p>\n<p>Currently, I also compiled parts (like the entire string library) of glibc into WASM object files, but not yet combine them into a sysroot, and I'm asking the questions above just trying to get some hints for how to achieve this. Thank you guys!</p>",
