        "content": "<p>Perhaps this is obvious in hindsight, but it took me a while to debug in practice:</p>\n<p>I've been working on WASIp2 support for the .NET runtime recently, which is currently based on the WASI 0.2.1 WIT files.  In order to provide an ergonomic <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> experience without creating an API compatibility hazard, we've added a couple of <code>internal</code> functions to the runtime: <code>RegisterWasiPollableHandle</code> (for registering a <code>wasi:io/poll#pollable</code> to be polled when all tasks are blocked) and <code>PollWasiEventLoopUntilResolved</code>(for running the top-level event loop, i.e. running any tasks and polling any <code>pollable</code>s).  Although they are <code>internal</code>, they can be called via the <code>UnsafeAccessor</code> attribute, which allows e.g. <code>wit-bindgen</code>-generated code to call them even though they're not part of the public API.  One consequence of that design is that application code must pass <code>pollable</code> handles as raw integers, which can lead to confusion if the app passes a 0.2.0 <code>pollable</code> handle instead of a 0.2.1 <code>pollable</code> handle; the host (e.g. Wasmtime) treats those as unrelated types and will trap the guest with an <code>unknown handle index</code> error if the former is passed where the latter is expected.</p>\n<p>The issue was easy enough to resolve: update the application code to use 0.2.1 so it matches what the .NET runtime is using.  However, I'm concerned that others may run into this both for .NET and other language toolchains.  It's not going to be obvious to users that <code>unknown handle index</code> traps may mean multiple <code>wasi:io</code> versions are in use, and that the guest confused them somehow, which might, in turn, be due to a mismatch between e.g. the <code>wit-bindgen</code>-generated code they're using (possibly indirectly, via an SDK) and the version their toolchain and/or runtime is using.  And this will become increasingly likely if we release new minor versions every two months or so.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, I wonder if we should have left <code>wasi:io</code> at 0.2.0 indefinitely given its \"special\" status as part of the connective tissue of WASIp2.  The problem will presumably go away with WASIp3, since most or all of <code>wasi:io</code> will be pushed down into the component model ABI, but we need to deal with it in the meantime.</p>\n<p>Wild idea: consider making <code>wasi:io</code> resources of any 0.2.x version interchangeable with other 0.2.x versions.</p>\n<p>Less wild idea: add special support to <code>wasmtime</code> and/or <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> to recognize when the guest has passed a resource handle of the wrong version and provide a detailed diagnostic, e.g. \"expected handle of type <code>wasi:io@0.2.1/poll#pollable</code>; got <code>wasi:io@0.2.0/poll#pollable</code>\".</p>\n<p>For .NET specifically, the core issue is passing handles as integers and thereby losing critical type information, so we'll have to think about how to do that better.  One idea I had was to split <code>RegisterWasiPollableHandle</code> into <code>RegisterWasiPollableHandle_v0_2_0</code>, <code>RegisterWasiPollableHandle_v0_2_1</code>, and so on as new versions are added.  That would help provide early diagnostics in cases where application code is incompatible with the .NET runtime (i.e. catch it in the guest before we get to the host, at which point the only option is to trap).   However, a given build of the .NET runtime could only support at most one of those functions since there's no way for the runtime to poll a mix of pollables of different versions concurrently.  Hence my wild idea above.</p>\n<p>Other thoughts?</p>",

        "content": "<p>I've done some work on this this week and I've hit a snag. This is a big enough snag that I don't believe this strategy is going to work out, and I think we may need to readjust other parts of WASI/versioning/etc to accommodate this possibly.</p>\n<p>A basic recap of the problem: within a single component or application we don't want to require that everything is in sync all the time. For example the adapter may use one version of WASI, wasi-libc another, and custom bindings yet another. The concrete case Joel ran into was wasi-libc and the adapter use 0.2.0 and the custom http bindings use 0.2.1. This is a situation we want to work.</p>\n<p>The reason this doesn't work today is because of how components work. The best way to phrase this is that eventually the application is going to want to block. The application, however, is blocking over a set of 0.2.0 and 0.2.1 pollables (e.g. think sockets from wasi-libc and http bits from the custom bindings). There's not actually a function to block over 0.2.0 and 0.2.1 pollables simultaneously, that just doesn't exist.</p>\n<p>The shape of this problem means that the host has little recourse to fix this. The host cannot detect what the guest component is trying to do without violating the semantics one way or another of the component model. This is where the <code>unknown handle index</code> error Joel mentioned came from. That happened because an 0.2.0 pollable index was passed to a function that wants 0.2.1, and Wasmtime raised a trap (according to component model semantics) in this situation.</p>\n<p>This led to the original idea of solving this. Change <code>wasm-component-ld</code> to unify the imports here where only 0.2.1 pollables are imported into the application. The idea though was that this solution would be implemented at the WIT level (where <code>wit-component</code> merges worlds together) rather than being WASI-specific. This brings us to the snag that I have now encountered.</p>\n<p>The basic idea of the solution was that there's an operation in <code>wit_parser::Resolve</code> where worlds are merged together. This happens when you take the world of the adapter, the world of wasi-libc, and the world of the custom bindings, and merge them all together to produce a final world which is what ends up being the interface of the component (e.g. all of what the component could import). This merging operation was where I was hoping to insert logic to say \"ok let's just import 0.2.1, not 0.2.0\"</p>\n<p>In this function though we are now faced with a situation of let's say we're merging worlds A and B. World A has pollable 0.2.0, but it also has <code>wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0</code>. World B has pollable 0.2.1 and also has <code>wasi:http/types@0.2.1</code>. Note that <code>wasi:{filesystem,http}/types</code> both depend on pollables. GIven this situation it's not actually possible to delete the 0.2.0 pollable import. That breks the import that <code>wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0</code> has. There's no way to upgrade <code>wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0</code>. Put another way this situation gives rise to a problem where it's not possible to create a world which is derivative of the actual original WITs.</p>\n<p>Various possible solutions to this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Just replace 0.2.0 with 0.2.1\". While this would work in this specific case it's also akin to just ignoring versions altogether. I'm worried that this additionally creates worlds which aren't actually connected to WIT at all. Today all component types and such can be traced back to original WIT files but if rewriting happens then that is no longer connected to any WIT files.</li>\n<li>Rewrite the dependency of <code>wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0</code> to <code>wasi:io/poll@0.2.1</code>. This is similar to the previous point to me where we're inventing WIT that doesn't actually exist. I don't feel that this is the right operation because it's working at the wrong abstraction level.</li>\n<li>Bake custom knowledge of WASI into <code>wasm-component-ld</code>. Basically it would always have the latest copy of WITs for WASI (or maybe all versions? I don't know). That would mean that there's a way to upgrade <code>wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0</code> to 0.2.1 or whatever version is desired, even if the component doesn't refer to it.</li>\n<li>Consider more radical alternative such as changing what's versioned. Maybe only version functions/types instead of interfaces? This is not really clear to me how it would work though as it would require basically removing versions from the component model.</li>\n<li>Remove versions entirely from WASI? That would solve the issue here because then there's no conflict. In some sense this is along the lines of what we're already doing where everything is basically considered frozen and we can only add things.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Personally I'm sort of out of ideas. I don't know how best to solve this. Until this is solved though I think we should put the brakes on WASI releases and not release 0.2.2 until we have a strategy for what to do.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As a small aside, I've realized that this is also a problem with <code>BuildTargets.md</code>, although a bit worse since the core module doesn't even know it's happening. For example the core module might import a poll function for 0.2.0 and 0.2.1 but the actual import string is the same to <code>wasm-ld</code> will deduplicate them into a single import (I think). That then has no way of actually getting routed to the correct <code>wasi:io/poll</code> function which would mean it'd be impossible to componentize the component.</p>\n<p>This in turn sort of gives rise to me thinking that it's not right that functions which all have the same definition are available under multiple versions. That seems to be causing more headaches than it's solving so it may be the crux of what needs solving? Unsure.</p>",

In particular: when <code>wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0</code> depends on <code>wasi:io/poll@0.2.0</code> via <code>use</code>, semantically this means that the <code>instance</code>-type defined by <code>wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0</code> is <em>parameterized</em> by some <em>abstract</em> (unknown) implementation of the <code>wasi:io/poll.pollable@0.2.0</code> semantic contract.  Because semver, we know that <code>wasi:io/poll.pollable@0.2.1</code> must be a valid implementation of the semantic contract of <code>wasi:io/poll.pollable@0.2.0</code> (in the same way that justifies the host in supplying <code>0.2.1</code> to a component that imports <code>0.2.0</code>), so it seems totally valid, in the final resolved C-M <code>component</code> type produced by the merge operation, to have the C-M <code>alias</code> inside the <code>instance</code> type of the imported <code>wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0</code> resolve to the <code>pollable</code> resource type exported by the imported <code>wasi:io/poll@0.2.1</code> <code>instance</code> type.</p>\n<p>As further supporting details: in the \"standalone\" representation of an <code>interface</code>, the <code>instance</code> type that contains the fields of the <code>interface</code> is wrapped with a <code>component</code> type containing one type <code>import</code> for each <code>use</code>d resource type.
