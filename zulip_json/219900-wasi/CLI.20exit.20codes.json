Currently, many of the .NET test cases return an exit code of 100 for success and -1 for error, which worked fine with WASIp1, but since WASIp2 only has an <code>exit</code> function that takes a <code>result</code> (i.e. either <code>ok</code> or <code>err</code>), we can't do that anymore.</p>\n<p>I assume the rationale for not supporting exit codes is that they're not sufficiently portable.  Is there more to it than that?  Would we ever consider adding an <code>exit-with-code</code> to a future WASI release?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://discord.com/channels/732297728826277939/732297825731215521\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/29a8c83fbc739f313cf0caf7112e41651b8deb75/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e646973636f72646170702e636f6d2f6173736574732f6f675f696d675f646973636f72645f686f6d652e706e67&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/732297728826277939/732297825731215521\" title=\"Discord - Group Chat That’s All Fun &amp; Games\">Discord - Group Chat That’s All Fun &amp; Games</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Discord is great for playing games and chilling with friends, or even building a worldwide community.
