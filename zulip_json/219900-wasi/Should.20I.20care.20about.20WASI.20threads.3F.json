I tried to fix it and I keep getting it wrong (honestly, guessing the right memory limits for CPython has always been tricky).</p>\n<p>I'm at the point I'm wondering if trying to keep WASI threads working with CPython is worth it? I'm willing to do it if people deem WASI threads worth supporting, but it will also mean me needing help figuring out what I'm doing wrong. But if WASI threads is kind of dead then I'm also fine ripping out the support in Python as it isn't being tested right now anyway.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121108\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/d5861c5fca5c1d4d186b79f35c86cbf45c6e14e6/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f393564396131363338393966303764393331336537366165333962623032643262343031343238646330653362623735383230353430303636656565353734352f707974686f6e2f63707974686f6e2f6973737565732f313231313038&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121108\" title=\"Max linker memory being set for wasi thread builds 路 Issue #121108 路 python/cpython\">Max linker memory being set for wasi thread builds 路 Issue #121108 路 python/cpython</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Bug report Bug description: The max memory for WASI thread builds is set at: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/1a2e7a747540f74414e7c50556bcb2cc127e9d1c/configure.ac#L2408C59-L2408C67 But that'...</div></div></div>",
