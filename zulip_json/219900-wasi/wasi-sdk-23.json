This tag has a few notable bug fixes and additionally contains a refactoring of the build system of wasi-sdk itself.</p>\n<p>If folks have a moment you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/tag/wasi-sdk-23\">test out the release binaries</a> in their pre-release state and report any issues. The thinking is to publish this officially after a few days of testing.</p>\n<p>One notable change is that the names of artifacts are now different, so scripts will need to be updated with more than just a version number change if there are existing scripts to download wasi-sdk.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/tag/wasi-sdk-23\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/2f0fd05967b5c2f02154a538f2ac5f5e329af33e/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f646163363262356664343830646461303961363539316338306135333663333939363065663462626338373565316366353930623562663034396337393734632f576562417373656d626c792f776173692d73646b2f72656c65617365732f7461672f776173692d73646b2d3233&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/tag/wasi-sdk-23\" title=\"Release wasi-sdk-23 · WebAssembly/wasi-sdk\">Release wasi-sdk-23 · WebAssembly/wasi-sdk</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">What's Changed\n\nAdd python3 as build requirement to README by @imrying in #415\nUpdate the version of wasm-component-ld used by @alexcrichton in #416\nexclude 32-bit Windows artifact in download-work...</div></div></div>",
