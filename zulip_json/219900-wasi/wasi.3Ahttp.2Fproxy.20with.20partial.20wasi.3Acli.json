        "content": "<p>I’m working on a prototype of wasi-http for Go, starting with TinyGo, that adapts the Go stdlib <code>net/http</code> semantics to wasi-http APIs.</p>\n<p>Currently, the <code>wasip2</code> target in TinyGo targets the <code>wasi:cli/command</code> world, and various parts of the runtime, <code>os</code>, and <code>syscall</code> packages depend on WASI packages imported by <code>wasi:cli/command</code>. One challenge implementing <code>wasi:http/proxy</code> is the lack of certain packages that the stdlib depends on, such as <code>wasi:cli/environment</code>.</p>\n<p>The Go <code>net/http</code> package that defines the standard HTTP interfaces imports the <code>os</code> package (among others) that when initialized, make calls that are implemented by WASI packages that are not included in the <code>wasi:http/proxy</code> world.</p>\n<p>Fixing this is tricky, and requires potentially invasive surgery to the Go stdlib, or would require Go programmers to <em>not</em> reach for packages they’re familiar with in order to use WASI. Given the tradeoffs, is there a role for <code>wasm-tools</code> or the Component Model standard to address this?</p>\n<p>Some options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Require that Go programmers do not import <code>net/http</code> or any other stdlib package that imports APIs unimplemented in <code>wasi:http/proxy</code>. I consider this a nonstarter, as Go programmers can and should expect to import stdlib packages with familiar interfaces, and reimplementing them in a third-party package would result in costly duplication of effort, and feature/fix/security gaps.</li>\n<li>Implement <code>wasi-http</code> as another <code>GOOS</code> target, e.g. <code>GOOS=wasip2-http</code>. This would effectively \"freeze\" wasi-http support into the stdlib and toolchain, but doesn’t scale—adding a new GOOS has initial and ongoing maintenance costs in Go, and wouldn’t be flexible to support other WASI worlds.</li>\n<li>Ring-fence use of certain WASI packages (outside of the common set like clocks, random, etc.) in the stdlib using Go build tags. This is workable, but introduces yet another layer of complexity to an already complex build process that WASI and the Component Model mandates.</li>\n<li>Implement an adapter for Go binaries that stubs out WASI packages not present in <code>wasi:http/proxy</code>, along the lines of the <code>wasi_snapshot_preview_1</code> adapter.</li>\n<li>Add an option to <code>wasm-tools</code> to stub missing imports as no-ops when creating a component, or allow a component to specify that it can survive with missing or unimplemented imports.</li>\n<li>Update <code>wasi:http/proxy</code> world (in say, version 0.2.2) to import a \"core\" set of WASI packages that are, by convention, present in all official WASI worlds, and recommended to be present in vendor-specific worlds. Likely <code>wasi:cli/{environment,stdin,stdout,stderr}</code>, <code>wasi:clocks</code>, <code>wasi:random</code>, <code>wasi:io</code>, and potentially a stubbed/empty <code>wasi:filesystem</code>.</li>\n</ol>",

The env vars could potentially make sense for exposing configuration, but <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-runtime-config\"><code>wasi:config/runtime</code></a> is the better match there, so the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http/issues/116\">idea</a> is to add that once <code>wasi:config/runtime</code> has sufficiently advanced phase, and then let env vars be virtualized in terms of <code>wasi:config/runtime</code>.</p>\n<p>Also, at some point in the future, I think the ergonomics of <code>wasi:cli/command</code> would be much-improved to have the currently-imported arguments and CWD be made <em>parameters</em> of the main/run function <em>export</em> so that <code>command</code> components can be imported (e.g., from CPython or Node) and their <code>main</code> called like a function passing arguments as arguments without shenanigans.</p>\n<p>For common stuff like time/random/config, though, one idea we've talked about is in the short term is defining a <code>wasi:io/core</code> world that contains the intersection between all the other WASI worlds that toolchains can depend on without knowing the actual target world.  Longer-term, I think each of these is a strong candidate for building into the C-M directly, with <code>wasi:io</code> ultimately disappearing so that there are no ubiquitous WASI imports, so <code>wasi:io/core</code> would be considered transitional.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-runtime-config\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/5451deaba9a98a3173f37837c7402b523465dc9d/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f373436373661626134666530366664633533623761373365356561613432613230653165316637636231376563646363363639353338653331396463616164352f576562417373656d626c792f776173692d72756e74696d652d636f6e666967&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-runtime-config\" title=\"GitHub - WebAssembly/wasi-runtime-config\">GitHub - WebAssembly/wasi-runtime-config</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Contribute to WebAssembly/wasi-runtime-config development by creating an account on GitHub.</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http/issues/116\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/466c0da06edc64a1c5cbb09bcc7ff95b171b7a3a/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f333131376134363362386264666363326537643231343331633130656663643232366635326531626364333564323833656531616230323934666466326138312f576562417373656d626c792f776173692d687474702f6973737565732f313136&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http/issues/116\" title=\"Consider adding wasi-runtime-config to proxy world · Issue #116 · WebAssembly/wasi-http\">Consider adding wasi-runtime-config to proxy world · Issue #116 · WebAssembly/wasi-http</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Reading configuration seems like a pretty common use case in the context of HTTP proxies.
