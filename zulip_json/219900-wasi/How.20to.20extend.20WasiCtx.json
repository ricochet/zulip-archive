Is it possible to extend the WasiCtx struct to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add additional attributes that I want to keep track of for my WASM module execution (e.g. an open socket)</li>\n<li>Implement functions (e.g. sock_open). I know this is possible by just adding impl sections but I'm unsure on how to add additional attributes as Rust doesn't support native inheritence.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I also can't copy paste the WasiCtx struct definition as it uses private crate references. Any help would be appreciated.</p>",
