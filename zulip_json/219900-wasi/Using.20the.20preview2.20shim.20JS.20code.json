I can add a notice to the source code specifying where those files come from, or add the Apache 2.0 license to those files, kind of like I have done with <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/wasm-bridge-macros\">wasm-bridge-macros</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also read <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/issues/42#issuecomment-1638177648\">this</a> response for a more complete picture of the story.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/kajacx/wasm-bridge\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/58ce2924dce6902d9f7870f47c343ad31dfd6835\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f366333363631623965383063336361323663356262353738386165626261393236393530336130333830313632663532343262356237356563646531303966392f6b616a6163782f7761736d2d627269646765)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kajacx/wasm-bridge\" title=\"GitHub - kajacx/wasm-bridge: Provides a single unified API to run WASM modules on the desktop using wasmtime, or on the web using js-sys.\">GitHub - kajacx/wasm-bridge: Provides a single unified API to run WASM modules on the desktop using wasmtime, or on the web using js-sys.</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Provides a single unified API to run WASM modules on the desktop using wasmtime, or on the web using js-sys. - GitHub - kajacx/wasm-bridge: Provides a single unified API to run WASM modules on the ...</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/issues/42#issuecomment-1638177648\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/a93ab4dd52f42036086d905dbbb76eaae8df95b2\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f616162633666353936376132613030346561653631386138666664383334316331353234386264666164663534316162376336623832336435646538653531362f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f6a636f2f6973737565732f3432)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/issues/42#issuecomment-1638177648\" title=\"Browser support · Issue #42 · bytecodealliance/jco\">Browser support · Issue #42 · bytecodealliance/jco</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">I did like to use jco for handling wasi preview2 in browser_wasi_shim.

While not only better from a code structure perspective, it would also create a path for upstreaming and downstreaming changes which I would highly encourage. WASI will be continuing to evolve and it would set up the process for keeping it updated without a huge amount of manual merging effort to get on that.</p>",

I intended to have two folders: \"original\" and \"modified\", both checked into version control, with a script that re-fetches the original from a git url and another script that \"massages\" the original. So any changes upstream could be propagated to my project with \"a push of a button\" and I would see what actually changed in the git diff.</p>\n<p>ES build looks interesting, I will try using that. Also, if there will be any changes \"fit\" to be merged back upstream, I will  create a pull request.</p>",
