Obviously the component model is a new concept with limited analogies to OOP and also visual representation using UML is unfamiliar. This post however is about the \"meta model\" behind the CM. </p>\n<p><strong>Question Set 1</strong></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://youtu.be/y3x4-nQeXxc?t=341\">Luke's presentation</a> he's describing a component with several imported interfaces of the same kind and one exported (path-based-router). My understanding so far was that you cannot import or export an interface more than once.<br>\nBut is this a limitation in the CM or in <code>wit-bindgen</code>? Is it envisioned to become possible?</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"y3x4-nQeXxc\" href=\"https://youtu.be/y3x4-nQeXxc?t=341\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/fa271afed70af4e4e72d46494a06afe170b460d0/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f793378342d6e51655878632f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div><p><strong>Question Set 2</strong></p>\n<p>Is it possible to <em>relay</em> an interface through a component?

If it has to re-implement <em>some</em> of the interface - can it at least <em>relay</em> resources through (as in: the component may decide to hand out a resource implemented within it <em>or</em> relay a resource received from the import side)?</p>",
