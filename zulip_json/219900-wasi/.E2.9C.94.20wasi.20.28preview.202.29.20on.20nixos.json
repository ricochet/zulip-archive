I am currently having a pretty enjoyable time investigating nixos for my host os - with plans to use nomad for app orchestration - and am wondering if anyone uses nixos for their wasi binary orchestration?</p>\n<p>Due to the nix-store, development envs can require overlays/config and virtualization may require certain configuration in setup. Is any specific virtualization or other config needed for wasi orchestration when deploying binaries directly on host and not in another vm?</p>\n<p>Based on my current understanding I doubt an issue would be insurmountable, but I am early in my investigation and started my first server image yesterday.</p>",
