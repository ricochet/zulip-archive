        "content": "<p>Whether or not this is the right place I can at least try to help out :)</p>\n<p>I think that you'll probably want to break things down into a few buckets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For \"only on wasm\" you can use <code>cfg(target_family = \"wasm\")</code></li>\n<li>For WASI you can use <code>cfg(target_os = \"wasi\")</code></li>\n<li>For the web... there's not a great answer. <code>cfg(not(target_os = \"wasi\"))</code> isn't right all the time. The best approximation for this is that <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> is often used for the web and you can test with <code>cfg(target_os=\"unknown\")</code>. Some WASI use cases use this as well though which is why it's not perfect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's at least the easy parts, but you probably already know much of that. The harder parts will make the answer much more nuanced here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For <code>wasm32-wasip1</code> you probably can't rely on <code>/usr/share/zoneinfo</code> and such. Most of the time guests don't have full access to the filesystem. Instead they typically get one directory. Or at least I haven't conventionally seen wasm tools get full access to the filesystem. This means that while you can probe for it you probably won't find those files and the answer is most likely \"you're out of luck\" and there's no way to do anything here.</li>\n<li>For <code>wasm32-wasip2</code> the <code>wasi-clocks</code> proposal is undergoing changes to add support for basic time zones. Whether or not that's enough for Jiff I'm not sure. I believe a work in progress is <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-clocks/blob/main/wit/timezone.wit\">here</a> but I think changes are being made. For this there's no current implementation to test against though.</li>\n<li>For the web there's no great way to detect \"this code is being compiled for the web\". In such a situation you likely want to use <code>js-sys</code> and <code>web-sys</code>, yes, to hook into whatever the JS platform has for time zones and whatnot. I suspect that the APIs you want are already bound and present.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's all to say I think the outlook is not so good for wasm support in Jiff. What I might recommend is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add a \"web\" or \"wasm-bindgen\" or etc feature. That would be explicitly enabled by end-users and would enable <code>js-sys</code>/<code>web-sys</code> integration. That'd be the detection for \"compiling for the web\". The end user experience is not great since it requires an opt in but that's sort of a reflection of the ecosystem right now (the whole rust/wasm-on-the-web is not as buttery smooth as native)</li>\n<li>If users want WASI support in Jiff then tell them that <code>wasm32-wasip1</code> is unlikely to ever be supported since it didn't have time zone support. The <code>wasm32-wasip2</code> target is a work-in-progress.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I suspect the folks working on timezones for <code>wasm32-wasip2</code> in WASI itself would love to get your feedback, but I'm not sure how best to connect them other than hope they're reading this as well.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-clocks/blob/main/wit/timezone.wit\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/0e8c332dcfd42077100fe27e62e164f0470c4c33/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f343738613963343662663266613539616635613835303362666335323338383761643862643064306266363162353435326161353435363765303139663331622f576562417373656d626c792f776173692d636c6f636b73&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-clocks/blob/main/wit/timezone.wit\" title=\"wasi-clocks/wit/timezone.wit at main · WebAssembly/wasi-clocks\">wasi-clocks/wit/timezone.wit at main · WebAssembly/wasi-clocks</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Clocks API for WASI.
