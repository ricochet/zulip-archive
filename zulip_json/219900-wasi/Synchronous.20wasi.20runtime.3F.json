And while that would be possible, it would be <em>very strange</em> if the game update tick would not wait for the individual unit's \"update\" methods to finish.</p>\n<p>When it comes to runtime compatibility, there is <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/async-compat\">async-compat</a>, but I have not really looked into that yet. I don't mind <code>tokio</code> being a transitive dependency, the desktop download size is not that important.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the web, <em>async</em> makes it <em>more</em> difficult, not less. For example, when using a jco-traspiled component, the imported functions cannot be asynchronous, at least as far as i can tell. But wasi imports are async, so just taking the rust async code and \"shoving\" that to a JS function that returns a promise simply doesn't work.</p>\n<p>The current solution I use in wasm-bridge is that all component import trait imlementaions (wasi or custom world import) must be sync, even if the function signature says otherwise. To enable async, browsers would have to support asynchronous improted function in webassembly modules, which I am not sure if they do. Or async would have to be supported by wit-bindgen / the component model, which will be in preview3.</p>",

Also, I do not understand how making the \"update\" function synchronous would drop the framerate when the camera moves too fast.</p>\n<p>It is true that the update function can take long if the guest code does a lengthy operation, especially IO like writing to a disk or (god forbid) makes HTTP requests. However, there are better ways to handle than making the entire \"update\" function async and not waiting for it to finish before updating the next unit (or advancing to the next frame for that matter).</p>\n<p>For example, the guest code could make those lengthy operations in another \"thread\". Again, I have not tried wasi threads yet, so I do not know how it works. But the alternative you seem to suggest (if I understand correctly), is to leave the exported \"update\" function async, and just call all the \"update\" functions on all units and go to the next frame, without even waiting for the async function to finish.</p>\n<p>That sound very bad, you could run into a situation where one update \"invocation\" is running on the same unit at the same tile as an \"older\" \"invocation\", which could create all kinds of bad (and completely unpredictable) behaviour. Worst thing is, the guest code is not using async at all! It is just implementing a \"normal\" update function, so who would expect it would be running concurenntly more than once at a time?</p>\n<p>The only \"real\" solution is to wait for async to be properly working in the component model. Then, the http wasi imports can be correctly labeled as \"async\" in the wit protocol, and the guest can call them only from async code, so only async exported functions can call the http imported functions to begin with.</p>",
