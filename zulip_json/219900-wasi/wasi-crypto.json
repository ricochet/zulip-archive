        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253994\">@Alex Crichton</span> and I spent some time brainstorming ways to support TLS for various guest languages (JS and .NET in particular, since they're priorities for us right now) last week.  The conclusion we came to (and which I shared with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"471788\">@Pavel Šavara</span> yesterday) is that the most practical way forward is to add a <code>wasi:sockets/tls</code> interface per the issue Dave linked to above (see also <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C55ph_fSTRhb4A4Nlpwvp9JGy8HBL6A1MvgY2jrapyQ/edit?usp=sharing\">this presentation</a>).</p>\n<p>Specifically, we'd like to create a draft of that interface by selecting a representative sample of database client libraries which use <code>System.Net.Security.SSLStream</code> in the .NET ecosystem and NodeJS's <code>tls</code> module in the JS ecosystem, constructing a minimal implementation that makes those libraries work.  I.e. we'd port just enough of .NET's <code>SSLStream</code> etc. and Node's <code>tls</code> to a draft of <code>wasi:sockets/tls</code>, starting with nothing and adding features to that draft as needed, until the libraries work.</p>\n<p>Per the above discussion, an alternative would be to come at the problem from the other direction: start with (an updated version of) <code>wasi:crypto</code> and build (or port) a TLS library to use it, with the high level code living in the guest and deferring to <code>wasi:crypto</code> for the primitives.  I'm personally reluctant to go that route since it would seem to require both more expertise and effort, although I certainly wouldn't complain if someone else wanted to tackle it.  I do agree that updating <code>wasi:crypto</code> would be valuable, but I'm not convinced it's the most expedient route to supporting libraries that just need TLS.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C55ph_fSTRhb4A4Nlpwvp9JGy8HBL6A1MvgY2jrapyQ/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/ef07b25e50530be471911f88d963b24ab0c82ce7/68747470733a2f2f6c68372d75732e676f6f676c6575736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f646f63732f41486b6277794c5a346d3579615765654e5a51433576486165652d527745364267664d32375762366d554735765173572d58464a6e7148326e4f3142764476386273433538514f6b54584b51626451734e66523066326d394c53665238574d46704e4b485261646a727a3675305a557946657253566163443d77313230302d683633302d70&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C55ph_fSTRhb4A4Nlpwvp9JGy8HBL6A1MvgY2jrapyQ/edit?usp=sharing\" title=\"wasi:sockets/tls\">wasi:sockets/tls</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">(Pre-)Proposal: wasi:sockets/tls joel.dice@fermyon.com</div></div></div>",
