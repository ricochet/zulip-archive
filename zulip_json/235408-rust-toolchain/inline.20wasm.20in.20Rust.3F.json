E.g. one can't just read a Vec which elements are only backed by the second memory; the main Rust program only knows about its own memory, and will assume that pointers into the heap are referring to the first memory. That stands for \"native\" stdlib Vec at least. For a custom, user-land defined Vec, we could teach it to allocate in the second memory instead, and read from/write into it. The header may still live on the primary memory (stack or heap), though. Does that make sense? (and please correct me if this is wrong; I'd expect this to work like that)</p>",
