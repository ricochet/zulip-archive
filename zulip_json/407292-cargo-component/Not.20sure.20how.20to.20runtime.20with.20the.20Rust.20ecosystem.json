After doing raw wit-bindgen on both sides, I would evaluate the process using the cargo component command. However, the only docs I can find for consuming WASM components in a Rust binary use the cargo component command for the runtime and component authoring.</p>\n<p>Is wit-bindgen necessary in the runtime host crate or can the wasmtime crate just reference a WASM file that's built as a component? Is cargo component authoring only necessary if I'm using crates as a package authoring mechanism for the WASM component?</p>",
