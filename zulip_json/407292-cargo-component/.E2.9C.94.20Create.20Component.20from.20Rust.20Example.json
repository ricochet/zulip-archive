I have successfully installed <code>cargo-component</code> and the build command finished BUT trying to use <code>wasmtime serve</code> tells me the wasm binary is not a component. After using <code>wasm-tools</code> with the preview1_reactor everything works just fine . </p>\n<p>My example is based on the Spin SDK:  <a href=\"https://github.com/fermyon/spin/blob/v2.1/examples/http-rust/src/lib.rs\">https://github.com/fermyon/spin/blob/v2.1/examples/http-rust/src/lib.rs</a></p>\n<p>Sorry for the obvious stupid question but I just would like to understand what can I do to get the most out of the <code>cargo-component</code></p>",

I am unfamiliar with the Spin SDK and what it normally is expecting to produce.</p>\n<p>If <code>cargo component build</code> is not producing a component (something that's easily verified with <code>wasm-tools print &lt;path/to/wasm&gt;</code> to see if it starts with <code>component</code>), then it's likely that there were no component type information section emitted into the core module output from the Rust toolchain.  That can happen if you're not explicitly generating bindings with <code>wit_bindgen::generate</code> or <code>cargo_component_bindings::generate</code> and also when not linking in any crate dependencies that similarly didn't include any bindings.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to file an issue on the <code>cargo-component</code> repository with repro steps, I am happy to take a look and see what the problem is.</p>",
