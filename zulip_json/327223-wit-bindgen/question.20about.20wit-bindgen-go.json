If it were set to 1 then component model functions would be able to take a single parameter as an actual parameter and anything more than that would be forced to go through memory. Parameters are also special because if they become indirect then the <code>realloc</code> ABI option is required and it was desired that for most common usage that would not be required. That's both an efficiency thing and a \"let's try to not depend on everything everywhere\" thing.</p>\n<p>The current spec was written in such a way that of the 4 paths you mention there's in theory only two which apply the same algorithm. Params/results have a different maximum (params 16, results 1). Given a WIT signature the types are all flattened and then if it's larger than the maximum it becomes indirect.</p>\n<p>FWIW this is sort of why all the infrastructure in <code>wit-bindgen-core</code> exists. It helps abstract this all away across each language so each language only has to deal with various specifics like \"load this 32-bit integer\" etc.</p>",
