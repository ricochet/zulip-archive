        "content": "<p>Hey! I am working on a webassembly version of homeassistant at <a href=\"https://litehouse.arlyon.dev/docs\">https://litehouse.arlyon.dev/docs</a>. It is very much in its infancy but it's fun to hack on. My next goal is building a workflow engine to connect inputs (state conditions like 'switch pressed') to outputs (actions in the world like 'toggle light').</p>\n<p>I am trying to figure out a good way to structure the plugins. The base plugin is implemented as a wit resource, and I am trying to find a decent pattern for modelling other interaction types (switch, notifier, media-player, etc). I would like the base plugin resource to be able to return a list of 'inputs' back to the host, which are other resources that it implements, such as 'turn switch on', 'turn switch off', 'play media'. Then the dynamic dispatch could be managed by the host rather than by the guest plugin.</p>\n<p>Options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>model these interactions as resources in their own interfaces, with the limitation that the server must have linked the relevant parts ahead of time. perhaps these worlds could be pluggable themselves rather than bundled with the server.</li>\n<li>model these over some basic <code>call(string, string)</code> dispatch thing and pass serialized args back and forth. extra flexible but not great ergonomics when it comes to writing plugins, and discovering the plugin api.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would like to do #1, are there any examples of this kind of thing in the wild I could look at? In the 1st case, is it even possible for the guest to instantiate other resources? I could return some data and have the host do it, but I can imagine a plugin author may want to share resources between a base plugin implementation and one of the resources it implements (or, in rust terms, have the same struct impl many traits). Are there facilities for doing this? Are there perhaps APIs to transmute a handle into another Resource type? In regards to versioning these interfaces, what happens if I link 0.1.0 of some wit and 0.2.0 at the same time? presumably it 'just works'?</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to read :)</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://litehouse.arlyon.dev/docs\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/ecfa0169eb1680ca513de6a7328fa288869e342d/68747470733a2f2f6c697465686f7573652e61726c796f6e2e6465762f6f70656e67726170682d696d6167653f64396236636532643464373030373336&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://litehouse.arlyon.dev/docs\" title=\"Quickstart\">Quickstart</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Installing and using Litehouse</div></div></div>",
