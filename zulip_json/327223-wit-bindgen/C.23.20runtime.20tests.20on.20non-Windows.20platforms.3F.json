I'm working on adding resource support to the C# binding generator and making decent progress so far, but I noticed that the runtime tests currently only run on Windows.  Is there a fundamental reason for that, or is it just that nobody has gotten around to making them work on other platforms?</p>\n<p>I naively tried removing the <code>if cfg!(windows)</code> check and ran <code>cargo test --no-default-features --features csharp-mono --workspace</code>, but that errored out because the compiler generated a Windows PE32 <code>csharp-wasm.dll</code> instead of a Wasm32 <code>csharp-wasm.wasm</code>.  I don't have much .NET experience, so I don't know if this is easy to fix or not.  I can boot up an old Windows 10 VM if necessary, but if there's a straightforward way to use either Mac or Linux I'd like to pursue it.</p>",
