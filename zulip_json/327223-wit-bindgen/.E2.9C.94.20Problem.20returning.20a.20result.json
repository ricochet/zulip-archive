Technically, it works. However, since this is not very expressive, I changed the signature of one function to </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"wit\"><pre><span></span><code>my-function: func(..) -&gt; result&lt;type,string&gt;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>, i.e. returning a <code>String</code> in case of error. Host and (component) guest compile fine but whenever the host tries to load the corresponding <strong>component</strong> the following runtime error is thrown: <strong><em>failed to convert function <code>my-function</code> to given type</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>The dependencies of the guest are <code>wit-bindgen = \"0.7.0\"</code>.<br>\nThe host uses <code>wasmtime = { version = \"10\", features = [\"component-model\"] }</code>.</p>\n<p>Are there any known errors with <strong>result</strong> as return type? <br>\nSomething else I might miss?
