We just had a short discussion about this in the weekly component model meeting, and these are my takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since there's already a Python host binding generator, we should try to follow the precedents it has set for type generation, etc, and reuse code where appropriate</li>\n<li>Ideally, the user experience should not involve a C or Rust compiler (meaning we shouldn't try to reuse C or Rust bindings and bridge them to Python)</li>\n<li><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"553681\">@Guy Bedford</span>'s work on JS is worth studying and emulating, and it may point the way to a wit-bindgen refactor to make binding generation for dynamic languages easier</li>\n<li>There are several people at several companies who are interested in this, so we should try to coordinate.  I can schedule a kick-off meeting if there's interest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that I'm not planning to work on this right away -- just putting together a plan of action.</p>",

I'm sure it has its own bugs and deficiencies and is primarily written by me who has almost no Python experience, so while it may off inspiration I don't want to give the mistaken impression that it should be religiously adhered to</p>",
