I have a simple foo.wit file which contains the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">enum</span> <span class=\"nc\">error</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">runtime</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">error</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">not</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">found</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">error</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">foo</span>: <span class=\"nc\">func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span>: <span class=\"nc\">string</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt;<span class=\"nc\">expected</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">error</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I have created two rust projects one imports this wit using <code>wit_bindgen_rust::import!(\"foo.wit\")</code> the other one exports it. I have a third rust project which tries to link these wasm modules and instantiate it using the wastime crate= 0.38. Here comes the fun part, it fails with </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">function</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">types</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">incompatible</span>: <span class=\"nc\">expected</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">of</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">type</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">found</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">of</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">type</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"kt\">i32</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I debugged this further by generating the rust code for import and for export and it turns out that the function signature for the same function is indeed different. What am I missing here? <br>\nAnother fun part is: If I try to link these wasm modules using the wasmlink cli tool then run it with cli wasmtime it magically starts to work.</p>",

An adapter of some form (which wasmlink generates) must be used to bridge the gap here rather than hooking up the modules directly.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks for the quick reply I understand that, but I thought that bridge code was generated by the wasmtime lib when instantiating a module with the Linker.  So the copy to one modules memory to the other memory should be handled. The only difference between this example <a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/examples-rust-linking.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/examples-rust-linking.html</a> and  what I want to do is I used a wit file as a common interface and generated one wasm file which imports those function and an another one which exports them. But in my case the wit-bindgen generates different function syntax for import and for export, so the linking fails. I think the only reason why the wasmlink can figure it out is the fact that it also requires  the wit file as a parameter.</p>",
