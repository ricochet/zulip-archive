For wasi-sdk's precompiled binaries on macOS I'm seeing <code>!1 = !{!\"clang version 16.0.0 (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project 08d094a0e457360ad8b94b017d2dc277e697ca76)\"}</code> in the IR. This means that a macOS host and a Linux host produce a different \"producers\" section in the output. You wouldn't happen to know off the top of your head why that is would you?</p>",
