For example, I just tried to create a very simple component from Rust code using wit-bindgen, but it ends up importing all kinds of interfaces (wasi:io/cli/sockets/random/...), none of which I would deem necessary, even when compiling to <code>--release</code>. It is not scalable to search through all dependency sources to find the root cause for each of these. Is there some automated way of doing this? How do you usually deal with it?</p>",

The normal inclusion of the WASI interfaces when building a rust component is because of the panic/unwind machinery, and there are rust-specific ways to remove that as well (that currently require nightly).</p>\n<p>As an example of other toolchains, <code>jco</code> offers a <code>--disable</code> option which can be used to remove WASI deps (for example, since <code>fetch()</code> works in JS anywhere, <code>wasi:http/outgoing-handler</code> is included by default).</p>",
