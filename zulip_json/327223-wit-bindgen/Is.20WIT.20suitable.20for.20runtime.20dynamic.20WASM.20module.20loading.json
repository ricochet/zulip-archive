Here's what I'm trying to do:</p>\n<p>I've got a bunch of WASM modules (starting with a simple calculator that has add/subtract functions) that I need to load and call at runtime in the host. The tricky part is that for new modules, I won't know the function names at host compile time. The host will read both the module and function names from a file as strings.</p>\n<p>All my WASM functions will use the same pattern:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take a Vec&lt;serde_json::Value&gt;</li>\n<li>Return a serde_json::Value</li>\n<li>Later on, I want to let these modules use file I/O and make HTTP requests</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've been looking at two approaches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using wasmtime::Val for dynamic function calls</li>\n<li>Using .wit files and the component model</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Val approach seems workable for runtime loading, though it requires more boilerplate code and needs a wrapper for type safety. WIT and the component model look great but might not be possible for my use case since they seem to require binding generation and component model setup at compile time.</p>\n<p>Key questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is this a case where using wasmtime::Val directly would be more appropriate?</li>\n<li>Is there any way to handle WIT interfaces dynamically at runtime?</li>\n<li>Or maybe some workaround since I won't know the function names at compile time? Loading different module names at runtime seems fine, but I'm stuck on the function name part.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any insight is greatly appreciated.</p>",
