This is actually two questions:</p>\n<p>1) Is it possible to load and use WASM components that use the component model in the browser?<br>\n2) Is it possible to load and use \"normal\" WASM modules that use wit bidgen (but aren't using the component model) in the browser AND is it possible to load and use these modules (again, not using component model, only wit bindgen) in wasmtime and get wit-bindings?</p>\n<p>The reason I ask is that I have a video game in Rust and I want to load mods using WASM modules. I also want to run the game on the web.</p>\n<p>If I use the component model, then it's probably not going to work on the web, since I didn't find any way to get a WASM component to load and run on the web.</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, I use just wit bindgen without the component model, then I do not know how to load and tun the module from wasmtime, since the only tutorials on how to use wit bindgen I could find use the component model when used with wasmtime host.</p>",

Today this is technically possible as native compilers are outtping core wasm modules which are then wrapped up into components. There's, strictly speaking, nothing stopping you from taking that core wasm module and running it in a browser and then alternatively also taking the component and running it in Wasmtime. </p>\n<p>I say \"sort of not\" though because this isn't really a supported workflow and will likely have a lot of gotchas and surprises and isn't how things are supposed to work. Instead a component is intended to be the \"source of truth\" and tooling like <code>jco</code> enables running that in a browser.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/b2a4e198f075aa4e3889665a8351852b0b01e08b\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f333732643664383065393462383663343861653537303965313865626462396436343662623234326361383665383365386431373833643664636266353733302f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f6a636f)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco\" title=\"GitHub - bytecodealliance/jco: JavaScript tooling for working with WebAssembly Components\">GitHub - bytecodealliance/jco: JavaScript tooling for working with WebAssembly Components</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">JavaScript tooling for working with WebAssembly Components - GitHub - bytecodealliance/jco: JavaScript tooling for working with WebAssembly Components</div></div></div>",
