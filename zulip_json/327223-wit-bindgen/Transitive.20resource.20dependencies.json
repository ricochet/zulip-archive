The problem is that you're not allowed to export A &amp; C without also exporting B. (here A is <code>foo:utils/utils</code>, B is <code>foo:a/a-child</code>, and C is <code>foo:a/a</code>).</p>\n<p>Let's say that B is not exported. That means that C's imports from B must come from an imported instance of B. You want C's imports of A, however, to come from the exported instance of A. The import of B must also mean an import of A, so this means that you've got imports of A and B with exports of A and C.</p>\n<p>In this situation C can, in theory, refer to two different A's. One is the imported copy through B and another is the explicitly exported copy. C, however, cannot at this time disambiguate which it would like to refer to. This also starts to set the stage for \"expected Foo, found Foo\" style errors where if C takes a type referring to B and additionally takes an A then the A that B references is different than the A in the argument list. This is all perfectly fine from a component model perspective in the sense that it can validate, however.</p>\n<p>In the end we decided to make this an error for the time being to be conservative. It's something that could possibly be revisited in the future though. I may also be missing a constraint here since this is off the top of my head</p>",
