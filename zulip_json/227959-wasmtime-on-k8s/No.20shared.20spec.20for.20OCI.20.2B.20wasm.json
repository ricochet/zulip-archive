But while working on trying to integrate WASM with OCI runtime, I face this issue sometimes i.e in order to toggle features related to wasm runtime from container images, we only have one method which is <code>annotations</code> and no common standard like we have <code>OCI spec</code> as a result I think each <code>OCI+wasm</code> implementation might end up with their own standards/annotations instead of following a  common spec.</p>\n<p>For example this will happen here <a href=\"https://github.com/containers/crun/pull/985#issuecomment-1211910701\">https://github.com/containers/crun/pull/985#issuecomment-1211910701</a> and I'm sure i will hit this problem again implementing other features as well.</p>\n<p>Github might be the best place to discuss this, but I  want to know if other folks see this is as a problem as well or is it just me overthinking.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/containers/crun/pull/985#issuecomment-1211910701\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/79266ac4d062e4dcdeb854e3339bdaff41a84735\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f643733316333313737343761616563386332363335636136366634653264663066303934303738623163626432376566626230623265663637646430613762302f636f6e7461696e6572732f6372756e2f70756c6c2f393835)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/containers/crun/pull/985#issuecomment-1211910701\" title=\"wasmtime: always grant `filesystem capability` for workdir inside container  by flouthoc 路 Pull Request #985 路 containers/crun\">wasmtime: always grant `filesystem capability` for workdir inside container  by flouthoc 路 Pull Request #985 路 containers/crun</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Following PR introduces two changes.\n* wasmtime: inherit argv from handler argument instead of process\nlibwasmtime_exec already passes argv which is generated from args\nprovided to container so use...</div></div></div>",
