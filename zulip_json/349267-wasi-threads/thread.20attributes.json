I'm no expert, but my understanding is that the \"normal\" methods for getting the current/main thread's attributes would be to call <code>pthread_attr_get_np</code> or <code>pthread_getattr_np</code> but the <code>_np</code> suffix denotes non-posix and are not available.  If I had created the thread myself I would know the attributes that I passed to <code>pthread_create</code> but for the main thread how can I get  <code>pthread_attr_getstack</code> ?</p>",
