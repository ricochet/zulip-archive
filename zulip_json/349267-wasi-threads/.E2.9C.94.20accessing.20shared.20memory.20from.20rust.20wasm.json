That part of this story should work, even if there may be rough edges here or there--try it out and create issues for anything that doesn't seem right in the embedding API!

If there were a way to pass a pointer to shared memory into wasm code, it wouldn't depend on the rust tooling. That could work for the use case of host allocating memory to use for message passing, separate from the guest's linear memory. Wasmtime's <code>Module</code> contains <code>ModuleMemoryImages</code>, a hashmap of <code>MemoryImage</code>. A <code>MemoryImage</code> can be static/shared, so its base address never changes.  The path I started on was trying to add something to that hashmap, but the only public method I could find was Linker.define().  I'm wondering if I pr'd another method to add a memory to Module or Linker, could that work? I have a few known-unknowns: how to map a usize host memory pointer to an i32, since I can't offset it by the guest's base; and how to make sure that a pointer from a shared memory block isn't determined to be invalid by the wasm's memory safety controls. </p>\n<p>Seprately, why is shared memory support dependent on the threads proposal? It would be useful in single-threaded scenarios as described above, where  the host manages access to the memory. Is it because of the desire to put atomics into the shared memory block?</p>",
