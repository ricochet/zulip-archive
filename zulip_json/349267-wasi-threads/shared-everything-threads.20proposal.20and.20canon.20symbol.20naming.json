So it looks compelling to experimentally add it, but the mapping between the proposal and a specific function name is unclear to me.</p>\n<p>Guessing from other component model functions it could be that <code>(canon thread.spawn &lt;typeidx&gt; (core func &lt;id&gt;?))</code> maps to the symbol name <code>[thread-spawn]i32</code> (I can't guess the module name), but I really would like to understand where to find this information. Any hints?</p>",
