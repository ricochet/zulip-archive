The IRC room on Mozilla's IRC network will disappear with the rest of the IRC network (to be shut down soon), and the Gitter room is no longer an official place. Yay for a single instant communication platform!</p>\n</blockquote>",

The choice of which one is currently deferred to Mozilla, which is in the process of switching over from IRC to something else.</p>\n<p>If you're a Cranelift embedder / user, and want to stay aware of organizational changes / security issues, you're invited to subscribe to this issue. Also, don't hesitate to say hi! :slightly_smiling_face: </p>\n</blockquote>",
