LLVM stores this map as an array of register pairs, and performs lookups using <code>lower_bound</code>. I'm not sure if cranelift should do the same, or use an array indexed by <code>RegUnit</code>.</p>\n<p>Should we wait until after <code>RegInfo</code> generation is converted from python before doing this?</p>\n</blockquote>",
