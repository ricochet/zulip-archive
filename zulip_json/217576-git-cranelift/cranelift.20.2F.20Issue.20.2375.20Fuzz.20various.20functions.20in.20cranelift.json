I think this could be a useful complement to the test suite, but I want to do the following before generating a PR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hook up a few more fuzzers.</li>\n<li>Debug at least one fuzzing failure.</li>\n<li>Document the debugging workflow for it -- the commit has some info, but the ASan backtrace is pretty useless.  How do I get gdb at the point of failure?</li>\n<li>Figure out if there's any useful integration to be done with the test suite.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
