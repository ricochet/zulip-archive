I glanced over the codebase and found no support for filling the delay slots; I had to emit NOPs after every branch in the meantime. (Indeed I didn't expect any because all currently supported architectures have no delay slots.)</p>\n<p>So what's the current plan regarding this? A roadmap or implementation guide would be great!</p>\n</blockquote>",
