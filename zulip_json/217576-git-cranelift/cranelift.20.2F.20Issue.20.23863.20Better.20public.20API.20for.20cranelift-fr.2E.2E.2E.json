Nicolas pointed out that the commentary makes it clear that it could really just be some <code>EbbState</code> enum, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"k\">enum</span> <span class=\"nc\">EbbState</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">UnChanged</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">Changed</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">ChangedAndTerminated</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This would help us make better sense of the public interface, where <code>is_pristine()</code> and <code>is_filled()</code> functions are part of the <code>FunctionBuilder</code> public API (used by <code>cranelift-wasm</code>), but it isn't clear what those words refer to, so you have to go digging around.</p>\n</blockquote>",
