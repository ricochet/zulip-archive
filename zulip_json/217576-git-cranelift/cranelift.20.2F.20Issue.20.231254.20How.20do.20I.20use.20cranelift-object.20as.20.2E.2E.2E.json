If not, could you release it to <a href=\"http://crates.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> so other projects outside the cranelift umbrella can use it?</p>\n<p>I'm interested supporting Windows in my compiler, which, since I'm emitting native code, means I need to emit PE/COFF object files. <code>cranelift-faerie</code> does not currently support this (<a href=\"https://github.com/m4b/faerie/issues/46\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/m4b/faerie/issues/46\">https://github.com/m4b/faerie/issues/46</a>). It's mentioned in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/511\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/511\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/issues/511</a> that <code>cranelift-object</code> supports COFF, so I was planning to use that. However, I can't figure out how! <code>cranelift-object</code> isn't on either <a href=\"http://docs.rs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://docs.rs\">docs.rs</a> or <a href=\"http://crates.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>, and I can't find any project using it except <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet/\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet/</a>, which pulls it directly from GitHub.</p>\n</blockquote>",
