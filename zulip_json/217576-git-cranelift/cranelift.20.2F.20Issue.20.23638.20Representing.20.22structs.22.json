I know that structures are more-or-less a virtual concept and can be introduced \"virtually\", by representing parts of them as different objects in memory. However, what if one wants to inter-operate with C library APIs that require passing a structure? As far as I understand, some strict memory layout standard should be followed with correct paddings and organisation. </p>\n<p>Is there any easy way of doing this? Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
