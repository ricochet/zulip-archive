That <code>try_into</code> isn't checking there were 4 bytes at the beginning of <code>bytes</code>. It's checking that the slice passed to <code>try_into</code> is 4 bytes, which will always be true because we indexed with a range of <code>[..4]</code>. If there were less than 4 bytes, then there would be a panic on the slice indexing, not on the <code>try_into().expect()</code>. IMO using <code>unwrap</code> is fine in this case.</p>\n</blockquote>",
