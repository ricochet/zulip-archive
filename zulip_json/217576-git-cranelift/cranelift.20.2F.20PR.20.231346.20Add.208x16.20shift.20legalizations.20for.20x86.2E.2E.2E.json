I still feel they should not be included due to the large overhead they impose on x86 but I am (rather unwillingly) implementing them here so we can get additional performance measurements.</li>\n<li>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</li>\n<li>[x] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

Is there a different way to do this? I looked at <code>binemit.rs::const_disp4</code> and it is not clear to me if/how at this point (when I'm doing legalizations) I can get an offset to the constant table.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think it can if it is function-related (not global) and relative to the PC: 1) once we know how long the function will be, <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/blob/cabbacbe63477fcc7d1f1e36717d84f08f749a98/cranelift-codegen/src/binemit/relaxation.rs#L130-L143\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/blob/cabbacbe63477fcc7d1f1e36717d84f08f749a98/cranelift-codegen/src/binemit/relaxation.rs#L130-L143\">calculate all of the offsets of jump tables, constants, and (now) symbols</a>, and 2) use functions like <code>jt_disp4</code>, <code>const_disp4</code>, and (now) <code>symbol_disp4</code> in <code>binemit.rs</code> to pull out those calculated offsets when we emit the code.</li>\n<li>Looking at this from distance, we would be doing the same type of thing three times and the code is fragile due to the distance between when the offsets are assigned (<code>relax_branches</code>), referenced in code (<code>binemit.rs</code>), and actually populated with data (<code>emit_function</code>). Perhaps we add an abstraction to <code>Function</code> like <code>RelativeOffsets</code> that would map any of these things (jump table, constant, symbol) to their offset; it would only be usable after some new counting pass (removing that logic from <code>relax_branches</code>), would be queryable when encoding instructions and would know how to lay out the actual data in <code>emit_function</code></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
