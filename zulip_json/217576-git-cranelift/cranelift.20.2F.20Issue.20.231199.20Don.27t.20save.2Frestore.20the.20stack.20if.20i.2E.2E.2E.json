Small functions which don't make usage of the stack will still preserve the stack pointer by saving it into the frame pointer register, which is spurious. It's a few instructions per call which could be removed in general.</li>\n<li>What is the value of adding this in Cranelift? Runtime speedup.</li>\n<li>Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>\n  algorithms to use? Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they better<br>\n  or worse than your proposal? Implementation should be trivial: lookup the number of stack slots<br>\nand don't preserve SP if there are no stack slots.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
