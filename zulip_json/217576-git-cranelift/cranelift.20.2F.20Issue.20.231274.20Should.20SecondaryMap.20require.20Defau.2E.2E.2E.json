This implies each SecondaryMap stores the default value, while we could just require Default and use <code>Default::default()</code> everywhere we use <code>self.default.clone()</code>. It would also allow using SecondaryMaps for things that implement Default but aren't Clone-able (I've got such a use case in a WIP PR).</p>\n</blockquote>",
