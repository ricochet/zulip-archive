Many VEX and EVEX encodings are only available in later SIMD feature sets (e.g. AVX-512); adding the ability to use VEX and EVEX encodings does not preclude legalizations for x86 CPUs without later SIMD feature sets, but that is a separate issue.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or algorithms to use?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think the relevant thing here is that it may impact how we go about resolving #1156.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they better or worse than your proposal?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not having the ability to use VEX and EVEX encodings would force cranelift to use multi-instruction legalizations instead of optimal instructions during instruction selection.</p>\n</blockquote>",
