Since this affects public APIs, I think everything needs to be updated around the same time.</p>\n<p>I am planning to do a new <code>object</code> release and associated <code>cranelift-object</code> update in the near future. Before releasing, should I update it to use the new version of <code>target-lexicon</code>? I'm fine with doing a <code>faerie</code> PR for this too.</p>\n<p>The alternative is to hold off updating <code>target-lexicon</code> for now.</p>\n</blockquote>",
