Format naming can sometimes be inconsistent.</p>\n<p>The <code>stack_load</code> format is used by two instructions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the <code>stack_load</code> instruction (load from the stack)</li>\n<li>the <code>stack_addr</code> instruction, which computes the address of a stack slot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>stack_store</code> format is used only the instruction that has the same name.</p>\n<p>For consistency with other operators, I thought about renaming stack_load =&gt; UnaryStack, and stack_store =&gt; BinaryStack, but I feel it hides part of the information (which is why I'm not a huge fan of BinaryImm in the first place).</p>\n<p>Maybe an alternative is to rename stack_load into stack_read, and keep stack_store as is?</p>\n<p>(Let the bikeshed begin!)</p>\n</blockquote>",
