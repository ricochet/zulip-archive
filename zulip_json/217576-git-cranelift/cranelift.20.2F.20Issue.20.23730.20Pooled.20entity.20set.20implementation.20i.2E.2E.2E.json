I wrote a pooled EntitySet based on EntityList and ListPool. It is similar to EntitySet, except that it used pooled allocation, and has some extra functionality. Is this something you would be interested in having in cranelift-entity?</p>\n<p>It is still unfinished, and I am adding functions to it as I need them, but I still think it is relatively useful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eirproject/eir/blob/master/util/src/pooled_entity_set.rs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/eirproject/eir/blob/master/util/src/pooled_entity_set.rs\">https://github.com/eirproject/eir/blob/master/util/src/pooled_entity_set.rs</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
