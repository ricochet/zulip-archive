It's believed (based on some preliminary benchmarking) that a pinned heap register is a performance win for many programs, and even when the multi-memory proposal lands I'd be inclined to keep a pinned register for at least one of the memories until we know we're not regressing performance.  It's not known how much of win the pinned register is, once we get serious about optimizations that target this particular problem rather than rely on general optimizations &amp; register allocation solutions.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Given this, feel free to close this bug as it sounds like discussions on this subject are ongoing. </p>\n<p>Just as a summary, the key points I wanted to make from my side was that </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cranelift continues to keep the \"pinned &amp; non-spilling\" base register support in the current reg allocator</li>\n<li>Make the case that Cranelift should continue to support \"pinned &amp; non-spilling\" base register in the new allocator as well. Our work on security and performance improvements relying on this, while ongoing, have some early results that are promising.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I will try to follow the existing discussions around this feature.
