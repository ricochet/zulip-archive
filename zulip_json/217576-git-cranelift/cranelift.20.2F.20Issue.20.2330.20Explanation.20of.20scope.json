Is this true, and always going to be the case?</li>\n<li>Does another tool to translate wasm to cretonne IR need to be built in order to generate code for wasm?</li>\n<li>Is it in scope for cretonne to output <em>to</em> wasm, or is it only intended to output to native code? (e.g. will I be able to use cretonne as a pure-rust binaryen alternative?)</li>\n<li>Is cretonne meant to be useful in both JIT and AOT configurations?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preferably, the readme or documentation should be able to answer these questions.</p>\n</blockquote>",
