It uses serde for serialization of compilation cache which consists of <code>SecondaryMap</code>s (among others). At the time of implementing the cache system, I had implemented simpler <code>SecondaryMap</code> serializer (current code) that uses whole byte for a bit flag (presence of an object at a given index) and this PR changes the serializer to pack these bit flags compactly. After implementing the simpler serialization, I had added compression to the cache system, so using whole bytes for single bit information shouldn't affect too much the size of the final cache that lands on user disk. I haven't measured the difference in performance and peak memory usage (intermediate step - after decompression, before deserialization) that this PR introduces.</p>\n<p>The change is tested by Wasmtime cache system tests.</p>\n<p>CC @sunfishcode </p>\n</blockquote>",
