I saw that there's a plan to use cretonne for rustc debug mode. But why should compilers handles two different target IR? If we can generate \"pretty good\" LLVM IR by running cretonne with <code>--target=llvm</code>, not just rustc but also whole range of languages whose compiler is written in rust can benefit from it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
