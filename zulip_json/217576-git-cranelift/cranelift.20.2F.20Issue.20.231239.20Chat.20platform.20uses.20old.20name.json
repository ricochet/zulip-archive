The current official platform is still <code>Cranestation/Lobby</code> on <a href=\"http://gitter.im\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gitter.im\">gitter.im</a>. Is there plans to change the name or move to a different platform with the organisational change?</p>\n<p>Personally the gitter clients has gotten quite poor in terms of performance and responsiveness, and I would prefer if there was a general organisation for all of the projects under the umbrella as the current gitter is mainly focused only on cranelift.</p>\n</blockquote>",
