We could unwrap the arguments at the top once and for all, and then generate predicates for each type the legalization affects.</li>\n<li>[x] Remove the condition when the value of <code>predicate</code> is a plain <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>[x] Try to gather the predicate conditions together, instead of refining the predicate (e.g. <code>let predicate = value_type == I64; let predicate = predicate &amp;&amp; type_sets[42].contains(something);</code> etc).</li>\n<li>[ ] Allow to bind several times in the <code>def!</code> macro.</li>\n<li>[ ] Consider adding a <code>ToRustCode</code> and <code>ToRustComment</code> trait that structs can implement.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
