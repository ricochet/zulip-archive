We actually had a chat with Till, and there's some likelihood (in my opinion) that people would be confused by the UI if landing on a stream, and would start asking random questions under random topics. No strong opinion here, just intuition, so we can start with what's done here and adjust if it doesn't work out!</p>\n</blockquote>",
