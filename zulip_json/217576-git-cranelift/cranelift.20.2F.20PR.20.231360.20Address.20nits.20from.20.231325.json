Note we can't check for the presence of <code>split</code> in the output after legalization, because the machinery is able to reuse a pair (previously created by a <code>concat</code>). It is just that now the test passes, while it was panicking before #1325. I reduced the testing scope by making it a legalizer test, and reflecting this by moving the file to a different directory.</p>\n<p>r? @eqrion </p>\n</blockquote>",
