The publication step <a href=\"https://github.com/alexcrichton/cranelift/runs/384203195\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alexcrichton/cranelift/runs/384203195\">looks like this</a> and the PR step <a href=\"https://github.com/alexcrichton/cranelift/runs/384097249\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alexcrichton/cranelift/runs/384097249\">looks like this</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that to merge this we'll need to add a <a href=\"http://crates.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> token to the secret environment variables of this repository. I think the best thing to do is to set up a new user which only controls these crates. That way the token only has access to these crates, no other crates (such as another users's crates if we used one of our own personal tokens). For this purpose I've set up a user <a href=\"https://github.com/cranelift-auto-publish\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cranelift-auto-publish\">https://github.com/cranelift-auto-publish</a> which now has a <a href=\"http://crates.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> account. If everyone's ok with this setup I'll configure the registry tokens and such before this merges.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It's largely just a question of what we want this to look like.</p>\n<p>We could possibly forgo the tags entirely, and have a scheme where every merge to master compares versions against <a href=\"http://crates.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> and if they changed the crate is published. I personally like the system of tags myself because it's pretty lightweight but still has a deliberate \"this is the thing I'm releasing step\", but I'm down for implementing whatever!</p>\n</blockquote>",
