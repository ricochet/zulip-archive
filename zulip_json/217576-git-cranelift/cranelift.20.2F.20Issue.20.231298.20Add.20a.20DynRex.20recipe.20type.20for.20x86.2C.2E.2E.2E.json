The only reason I would be reticent to do so is that Chris Fallin is working on a prototype for deleting the entire Recipes system, and so I don't know what the future will look like. However if it's not a ton of work and makes the emission-conditions more explicit, that's likely a good idea.</p>\n</blockquote>",
