Currently, I can type \"gen\" for \"cranelift-codegen\", but with the additional \"crates\" directory, I won't be able to do this. It's a minor annoyance, if there was a way to fix it (use special paths for Cargo.toml files and the src directory they refer to?) it'd be nice, otherwise i can live with it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
