In contrast, the callee-save code added here should be <code>[rsp - csr_stack_slot_offset + FPR_offset]</code> where <code>FPR_offset</code> is 0x10, 0x20, ... as appropriate. The offsets recorded are <code>FPR_offset</code>, and my suspicion is that they would be interpreted as offsets from the other side of callee-save space by Windows.</p>\n<p>This is well beyond my experience with Windows to actually verify.

In the test output, an offset of 0, 0x10, and 0x20 make sense given that the SP will be adjusted up during unwinding restores the XMM registers.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we should adjust the SP first?</p>\n</blockquote>",

It's the instruction that would be correct to get the stack slot's start at the entry of the function without intervening changes. That is, the return address and <code>rbp</code> are preserved on the stack by Cranelift, and 0x10 down the stack from the base address of the call frame would be <code>rbx</code> and the start of the rest of the csr region. <code>rsp</code> isn't really \"ready for use\" until after the prologue though, so <code>stack_addr</code> doesn't seem appropriate to use as it currently exists for this purpose.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, the xmm stores _would_ overwrite the return address, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rbx</code>, ..., were the stack slot address right - I misunderstood which direction offsets count from too.</p>\n<p>I think what I can do is make a second stack slot that we can directly address for FPR save/lrestore, and requiring 16-byte alignment on that would keep offsets simple as well.

I can argue the correctness of 12, though. For <code>stack_slot</code> reasons I don't understand, the FPR preservation region is aligned more strictly than necessary. This grows what would be 48 bytes into 64. Plus eight bytes to realign the stack, and 32 bytes of shadow stack space, that makes for a 104-byte allocation. That would be 13 8-byte slots, minus one for the implied slot makes 12!</p>\n<p>A similar wider-than-necessary FPR region is also present in the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/blob/399fb63390f66592730f9922f89b980b16a1ad22/filetests/isa/x86/windows_fastcall_x64.clif#L49\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift/blob/399fb63390f66592730f9922f89b980b16a1ad22/filetests/isa/x86/windows_fastcall_x64.clif#L49\"><code>float_callee_save</code></a> test I added. I've tried to follow through what causes this in <code>layout_stack</code> and my best theory is that treating a stack slot as a collection of smaller units is not quite how it's intended to be used, and instead it tries to align the provided stack slots using their sizes as an alignment requirement. It looks like treating a stack slot as an aggregate of more permissible units might be a bit of a change, so I'm open to recommendations if taking ~16-48 extra bytes per call frame is a nonstarter.</p>\n</blockquote>",
