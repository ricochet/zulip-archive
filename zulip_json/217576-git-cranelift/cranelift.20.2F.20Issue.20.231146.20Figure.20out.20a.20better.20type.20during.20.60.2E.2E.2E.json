This may be rather confusing when looking at CLIF IR because the intent of that move (using the <code>bitcast</code> instruction) is to zero out the upper bits and only load the lower bits using the scalar value--it's more a <code>I128x1</code> than anything else.</p>\n<p>There are several options here, some of which are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>leave as-is with <code>I64x2</code> and remove the TODO comment</li>\n<li>change the typing restrictions to allow <code>I128x1</code></li>\n<li>use a different CLIF instruction altogether</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
