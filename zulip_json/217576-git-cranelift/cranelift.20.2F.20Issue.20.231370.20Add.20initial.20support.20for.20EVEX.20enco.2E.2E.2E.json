(And @peterhuene too!) I believe this is ready for an actual review--@iximeow, can you take a look? I rebased the commits into some semblance of order so they should be reviewable from oldest to newest (fun fact of the day: I had to redate them for GitHub to show them in order). Since we likely won't want to squash these things, I made sure the commits are bisectable by running <code>git rebase master --exec 'cargo test --all'</code> with no issues. </p>\n<p>I would like to be able to actually run this new instruction on AVX512 hardware with a <code>test run</code> filetest but I will try that in a future PR; currently I don't think we have the ability to skip <code>test run</code> filetests when the target doesn't match the host's CPU features (or do we?).</p>\n</blockquote>",
