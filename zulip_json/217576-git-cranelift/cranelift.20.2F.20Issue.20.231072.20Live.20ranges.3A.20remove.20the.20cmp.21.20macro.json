This was done to make it easier to read things like \"order.cmp(a, b) != Ordering::Less\", which means \"a is greater or equal than b\". The need to invert the meaning makes it hard to grasp what it's doing, and I thought using plain &lt; / &gt; signs made it simpler.</p>\n<p>@abrown suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What about just implementing Ord and Eq on ProgramOrder or ExpandedProgramPoint or wherever it is needed so that the &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, etc. are overloaded and we can just use the operators directly instead of a macro or order.cmp...? It may require adding a method to ProgramOrder but the following seems more clear to me: order.of(to) &gt;= order.of(self.def_begin).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the former can't be done (since the ProgramOrder uses its own data fields to retrieve the actual position index used in the comparison), the latter with an \"order.of\" function can be done. See <a href=\"https://github.com/bnjbvr/cranelift/commit/0b8e633314fac9d607a47a1955f9832a250a2319\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bnjbvr/cranelift/commit/0b8e633314fac9d607a47a1955f9832a250a2319\">here</a> for an incomplete implementation.</p>\n<h3>Alternatives</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>just using the previous state. This would be worse in my opinion, and doesn't solve the readability issue.</li>\n<li>keeping the cmp! macro and extending usage. It's a simple macro, but that's one more step when trying to understand this code, and debugging with macros isn't trivial.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
