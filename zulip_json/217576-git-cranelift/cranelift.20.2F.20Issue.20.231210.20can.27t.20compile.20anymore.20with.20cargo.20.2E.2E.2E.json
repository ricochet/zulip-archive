But I would like to point out that this is a very distro unfriendly behavior, making the job of packaging cranelift difficult or impossible, depending on how strict the individual distro's policies are in regard of network sandboxing for root. </p>\n<p>Also I think firefox pulls in certain parts of your tree, so this might blow up at their end too. </p>\n</blockquote>",
