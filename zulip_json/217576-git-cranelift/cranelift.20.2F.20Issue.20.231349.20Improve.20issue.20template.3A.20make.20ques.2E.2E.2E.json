But if they are, how about using short headings and leaving the verbose questions out of the resulting issue? I find that they make the issues too cluttered. So something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>#### Feature\n\n&lt;!-- What is the feature or code improvement you would like to do in Cranelift? --&gt;\n\n#### Benefit\n\n&lt;!-- What is the value of adding this in Cranelift? --&gt;\n\n#### Implementation\n\n&lt;!-- Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or algorithms to use? --&gt;\n\n#### Alternatives\n\n&lt;!-- Have you considered alternative implementations? If so, how are they better or worse than your proposal? --&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n</blockquote>",

It's a good idea to revisit it. I like @philipc's template, in that it's a bit shorter and still includes detailed questions that would get removed once the issue is submitted.
