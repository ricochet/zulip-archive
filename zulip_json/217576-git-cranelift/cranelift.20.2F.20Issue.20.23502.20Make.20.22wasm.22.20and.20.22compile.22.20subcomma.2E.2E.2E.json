Currently, they print different things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"wasm\" has a -v option which enables colorized messages like \"Translating... ok\", \"compile\" doesn't</li>\n<li>\"compile\" prints out the \".byte\" sequence, \"wasm\" doesn't</li>\n<li>\"compile\" runs the capstone disassembler, \"wasm\" doesn't</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and possibly other differences. We should harmonize these two subcommands.</p>\n</blockquote>",
