The core of the problem is that the WIT package is required both before and after code compilation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Before</strong>: The WIT package is needed to generate language bindings.</li>\n<li><strong>After</strong>: It’s required to run <code>wasm-tools component embed</code> to embed necessary information into the component.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>\n<p>The solution we’re considering involves embedding the WIT package into Wasm custom sections during the language compilation/toolchain process. This would make it easier to componentize the module post-compilation and I believe this is how cargo-component doing today.</p>\n<p>However, there’s currently a lack of documentation and conventions on how to embed the WIT package into Wasm custom sections. My intention for this message is to collaborate on standardizing this as part of the Component Model specification in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"394175\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/394175-SIG-Guest-Languages\">#SIG-Guest-Languages</a> . </p>\n<p>Would love to hear your thoughts on how we can move this forward.</p>\n<p>CC <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"639636\">@Randy Reddig</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253998\">@Luke Wagner</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253994\">@Alex Crichton</span> for your contributions to this idea.</p>",
