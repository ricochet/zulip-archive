Right now Componentize-Py and Componentize-JS currently use different names (wit-path vs. wit, world-name vs. world) and use <code>-w</code> to mean two different things. I haven't done a survey of Cargo Component's options but they should ideally match too. What do we think would be a sensible default choice for how we name these things that we can apply to all the tools?</p>",
