Unfortunately, the backport to CPython 3.13.1 is going to take a little work. But before I bother with that, I thought I would ask if anyone cares? CPython 3.13 will reach end of life in October 2029, so if people are concerned that WASI 1.0 might hit before then and changing the defaults is worth it, I can make it happen.  But do note CPython 3.13.0 still has the <code>wasm32-wasi</code> default in the code.</p>\n<p>So, should I be lazy or thorough with this?</p>",
