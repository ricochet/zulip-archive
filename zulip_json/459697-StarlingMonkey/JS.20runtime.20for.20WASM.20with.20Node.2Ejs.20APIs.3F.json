        "content": "<p>Hi, I'm working on a library for stress testing called <a href=\"https://github.com/drogus/crows\">Crows</a>. It's a proof of concept so far, but I wanted to add more features in the near future and one of them is JavaScript support, ideally implementing Node.js APIs. I don't need everything (for example I wouldn't allow using process APIs anyway), but it would be nice to support NPM libraries that use stuff like sockets or <code>http</code>. I found <a href=\"https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs\">WasmEdge QuickJS</a> implementation that looks neat, but:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I use WasmTime and I don't want to switch</li>\n<li>WasmEdge seems to support async only on Linux. Not sure how much effort it would need to run on Mac</li>\n<li>QuickJS is neat, but I wanted something a bit more performant like SpiderMonkey (I don't care <em>that</em> much about startup time as typically when running stress tests I would prepare enough instances), which is also more actively developed</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do you know of any efforts in that direction? I haven't found any explicit projects, but if there's even a proof of concept (ideally based on Rust) I would be interested in helping to push it forward.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/drogus/crows\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/7864d8453250c1bf815b74f8cafba837c1cc5b73/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f363630313135633234623437306566373461333463393766666330343661396230303866626262363363346436643635313334373234366361636435636466632f64726f6775732f63726f7773&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/drogus/crows\" title=\"GitHub - drogus/crows: A distributed load testing tool written in Rust running WASM compiled scenarios\">GitHub - drogus/crows: A distributed load testing tool written in Rust running WASM compiled scenarios</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">A distributed load testing tool written in Rust running WASM compiled scenarios - drogus/crows</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/4a39c69708e653542eaab2f83fca7c1da0290c60/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f346464373639316566316265623032663561616361653438333138666132626534376336303538346330323435643334396361303237616133323039386435372f7365636f6e642d73746174652f7761736d656467652d717569636b6a73&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs\" title=\"GitHub - second-state/wasmedge-quickjs: A high-performance, secure, extensible, and OCI-complaint JavaScript runtime for WasmEdge.\">GitHub - second-state/wasmedge-quickjs: A high-performance, secure, extensible, and OCI-complaint JavaScript runtime for WasmEdge.</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">A high-performance, secure, extensible, and OCI-complaint JavaScript runtime for WasmEdge. - second-state/wasmedge-quickjs</div></div></div>",

I recently added AOT compilation mode to SpiderMonkey on Wasm and integrated it into StarlingMonkey, but you can still expect it'll be slower (sometimes significantly) than a native JIT compiler. This is a fundamentally hard research problem, not a \"just port the JIT compiler\" sort of thing, because of several aspects of Wasm; there's ongoing work :-)</li>\n</ul>",

My project is a hobby project for now and although I wish people will find it useful and start using it, I'm not worried to use early development projects. Regarding JIT, I am aware of no-JIT nature of WASM. Honestly, I'm not too worried about performance at the moment either, but in the long term I just prefer to have an option to do more optimizations (like AOT compiling that you mentiond).</p>",
