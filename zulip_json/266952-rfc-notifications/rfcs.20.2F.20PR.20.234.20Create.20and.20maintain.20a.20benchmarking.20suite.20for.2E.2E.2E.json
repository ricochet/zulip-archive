On one hand, we might say that micro-benchmarks are in indeed in scope, specifically because we're not trying to build a General-Purpose benchmark suite, but instead just something to collect data to help identify performance changes over time. On the other hand, some parts of this proposal talk about a desire for a representative corpus. Could you clarify the intended stance on microbenchmarks?</p>\n</blockquote>",

As long as the microbenchmarks use the same benchmarking API/protocol that the rest of the corpus uses, supporting them should be straightforward and shouldn't require any additional engineering effort.</p>\n</blockquote>",
