We can always extend the enum in a backwards-compatible way (or just add more methods to <code>Config</code>) and I think it's a good observation that the allocation strategy is so tightly coupled to the internals of wasmtime we wouldn't really expect anyone to implement the traits anyway.</p>\n<p>The <code>wasmtime</code> crate changes look good here to me! I'm not reading the internal changes too too closely, but I'm assuming they're all fine as well (and are easy to change if a problem arises)</p>\n</blockquote>",
