The counter argument is that not trusting by default (and only include arbitrarily trusted people within the Alliance) sounds more like the opposite of trust.</p>\n<p>Additionally, basing the selection of contacts on socialization has limits: it doesn't look like it would scale well with an increasing number of organizations in the Bytecode Alliance, times an increasing number of projects hosted by the Bytecode Alliance. In fact, it's unclear what should be the topics of socialization, and with which depth one should share implementation details that might also require an individual organization's discretion (think NDA).</p>\n<p>I think there's an opportunity to do better here. We could imagine sharing light details with technical contacts of each Bytecode Alliance organization, on an internal but private secured channel (e.g. Signal, or any other equally valid broadcasting secured mechanism), that would make it possible for members to know if they're effectively affected or not. That could include, for example: patterns to look for in error logs, in the case of Wasmtime examples of <code>Config()</code> that would be affected by the security issue, metrics to watch and for which outliers could indicate potential exploitation in the wild. Other useful information could be shared according to the context around the security issue. After sharing that information, technical contacts could confirm whether they're impacted or not, and if impacted some extra actions could take place to ensure the issue might be mitigated for them (temporary patches for mitigations? getting early access to the CVE? request filters if Web/cloud providers? Each issue is likely to have its own set of temporary and useful countermeasures).</p>\n<p>Of course this process doesn't pretend to be perfect and could be adapted. I think that in general, this would spur trust within the Bytecode Alliance and across its different members, by trusting by default instead of assuming the worst (notably that insiders would leak the exploit). Some entities might and will run Bytecode Alliance projects in production and they could be badly impacted if they had to schedule updates at the last minute, would they never hear about a security issue, because it was incorrectly decided (due to ineffective/incomplete/poor \"socialization\") that they would not be impacted.</p>\n</blockquote>",
