From the perspective of authoring Wasmtime it means that we'll quickly fall into a trap of \"oh when's the right time to have a breaking change?\" and try to batch things up, in my opinion creating unnecessary tension for landing improvements and updates to the engine.</p>\n<p>From a user's perspective I would consider Wasmtime as a \"weighty\" enough dependency that even if you want to update patch versions there's likely to be some sort of gotcha depending on how deeply integrated it is into your system. This means that we, as maintainers, will likely spend a lot of time trying to chase down unintended consequences of changes in embeddings we have limited access to.</p>\n<p>I feel that the best compromise between these worlds is regularly expected breaking changes (mild breaking) and users having the expectation that they'll have to bump the version. This creates a number of motivations towards what I feel is \"the right thing to do\":</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As authors we don't feel hindered landing breaking changes (minor ones)</li>\n<li>As authors we are vigilant to clearly document any possible breakage in release notes</li>\n<li>Users should expect that upgrades are hassle-free, not literally free</li>\n<li>Users should expect to read the release notes and determine risks to their application, if any</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don't think it's viable to have a situation where we, as the Wasmtime project, take on 100% of the work of keeping everyone else's applications running. Our job, in my opinion, is providing a solid WebAssembly runtime that users can rely on. Requiring a small amount of end-user assistance, though, greatly helps actually releasing new features and not feeling hindered in development.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Most of this RFC is about LTS/point releases for Wasmtime, and I don't think it would apply in the case that the bug from Cranelift isn't exposed through Wasmtime's usage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is the key point. The way Cranelift is tested right now in particular doesn't really allow us to make strong claims about its stability and quality properties when used to compile non-Wasm content, and perhaps even when used in other embeddings in general.</p>\n<p>I think that will change, but this RFC is about Wasmtime, and in that context it makes sense to treat Cranelift purely as a dependency <em>to Wasmtime</em>, and look at its stability and quality properties through that lens.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it's hard for me to imagine at the moment what would cause Cranelift to diverge to another release process</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also agree with this, though! When Cranelift gains a stability story of its own, that explicitly encompasses other uses, I don't think that'd be a reason for it to also gain a completely separate release process. It seems much better to broaden the scope of guarantees we give for it by introducing the required testing strategies, etc, but still let it benefit from being included in the same release train schedule, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Given how different the LTS process is I don't forsee it being easier to add now vs later if we decide to do it, so in that sense I don't think there's urgency to add it earlier while the release process is all in someone's head.</p>\n<p>An alternative model could be one where the LTS windows overlap for 1 release instead of 5 releases. For example 5.0 would be an LTS release for the 5.0-11.0 releases, but when 12.0 is released only 10.0 is a supported LTS release. Something like that means that our window for supporting multiple LTS releases is much smaller and because 11.0 is probably pretty similar to 10.0 any work for backports would primarily be from 11.0 to 5.0 rather than 11.0 to 10.0 (which is likely cherry-pick-able). This would still have the property where there's a window where users can upgrade but still get bug fixes if necessary.</p>\n<p>Naturally though I'd expect that anything here can change at any time with sufficient consensus. It's probably a lot easier to add an LTS process than it is to remove one as well. Given that we don't have anyone specifically asking for LTS it may not be a bad idea to not support it initially. We could have some initial releases and see if users find the update-every-4-week cadence to be too onerous. We'd probably, in that case, update the bugfix policy to backport to the current release at the time of the bugfix and perhaps the last 1-2 releases prior to that as well.</p>\n<p>Overall I don't personally know the best thing for Wasmtime at this time. We made an initial guess with 2 LTS releases at this cadence, but it's mostly a guess that it'll work out.</p>\n</blockquote>",
