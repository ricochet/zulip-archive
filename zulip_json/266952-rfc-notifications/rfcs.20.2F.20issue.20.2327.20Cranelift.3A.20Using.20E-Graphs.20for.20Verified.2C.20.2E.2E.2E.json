Before doing measurements I want to do some basic optimizations to the scheme that I know how to do -- mainly, reuse existing CLIF insts rather than repopulating -- which should dramatically lower overhead. If with that we are \"at parity\" or \"not much worse\" than LICM (assuming LICM tweaks here) + GVN today, then I'd be very happy, but I guess how much overhead to accept there (in exchange for having an optimization framework) is another good discussion point.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Usually<br>\nwe know we can implement the thing, and the RFC process is more about API design<br>\nand determining whether to implement the thing as described or in some<br>\nalternative way. Merging most RFCs is essentially committing to \"yes we will do<br>\nthis\". This RFC, on the other hand, has relatively large open questions around<br>\ncompilation overhead and whether we will actually solve phase ordering the way<br>\nwe believe we should in theory. I think merging this RFC doesn't necessarily<br>\nmean \"yes we will do this\" because we still aren't 100% sure we <em>can</em> do<br>\nthis. We <em>think</em> we can, but we need to actually build more to prove it out. So<br>\nI think merging this RFC should mean something more like \"we will start landing<br>\n(<code>cfg</code>'d off) code in <code>main</code> and when we (hopefully) reach X, Y, and Z<br>\nacceptance criteria, we will stop hiding the code behind <code>cfg</code>s and remove the<br>\nold, non-egraph code paths.\"</p>\n<p>And I would love this RFC to define and document our ahead-of-time consensus on<br>\nwhat exactly those acceptance criteria are so that we don't have moving goal<br>\nposts later on down the line when we are deciding whether to actually, fully,<br>\n100% commit to the e-graphs mid-end framework or not.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Just to spark discussion, I'll throw some stuff out there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>What kind of compile time overhead is acceptable for when we first turn this<br>\n  on (with the expectation that we will have potential compile time wins down<br>\n  the line as documented in the \"Overall Cranelift Structure and Migration Path\"<br>\n  section)? 5% overhead? 10%?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What kind of memory overhead during compilation is acceptable? Unlike compile<br>\n  time, I don't think we have any obvious possibilities for improving this in<br>\n  the future other than limiting e-nodes/e-classes. (Please correct me if I'm<br>\n  wrong!) 50% additional max RSS? 20%? 10%?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, what should the acceptance criteria be for generated code quality?<br>\n  How about: none of our Real World benchmarks in sightglass (SpiderMonkey,<br>\n  markdown, bz2, meshoptimizer, and maybe intgemm-simd but I'm less familiar<br>\n  with that one) get statistically significantly worse execution times and at<br>\n  least one of them gets statistically significantly better execution<br>\n  time. Additionally, we verify by hand that the alias analysis and GVN phase<br>\n  ordering example you mention in the RFC actually gets resolved in practice by<br>\n  our e-graphs framework.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What do other Cranelift stakeholders think our acceptance criteria should be?</p>\n<p>Does compile time/space and code quality cover everything we need to keep an eye<br>\non as far as acceptance quality goes or am I missing something else?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

On SpiderMonkey.wasm, the overhead of roundtripping through the egraph adds about 23% to compile time (when opts are enabled). All current handwritten opts account for about 10% of compile time.</p>\n<p>That's not terrible (not a doubling, for example) but it's not great either, so I dug into which parts were slow. It turns out that the extraction and elaboration take very little time (less than 10% of the egraph addition); most of the time is in the initial egraph build.</p>\n<p>I suspect that we'll need to do some careful data-structure engineering to get things within acceptable overheads, but fortunately it looks like there's some relatively low-hanging fruit. Right now in <code>egg</code> the <code>EClass</code> struct keeps two <code>Vec</code>s, one for nodes and one for parents; the <code>Id</code>-to-<code>EClass</code> map is a <code>HashMap</code> while I would expect the <code>Id</code> space to be somewhat dense (maybe this is to clear out eclasses that have been merged?); and the <code>Node</code> interface forces us to keep args internally in separate lists (I use <code>SmallVec</code> currently for this). All of this could be refactored to use central <code>Vec</code>s in a pseudo-arena way (like Cranelift does for CLIF args/results currently), at the cost of passing around the \"backing <code>Vec</code>\".</p>\n<p>I'll work on that for a bit, then return to hacking on the ISLE integration; once I prove out both of these, I'm happy to make a bunch more measurements!</p>\n</blockquote>",

I guess that's true in a \"fraction of time spent in construction+extraction\" sense, but I'm thinking in an absolute sense here: the time spent building the egraph and extracting from it, with no work between the two, is the bare minimum in additional overhead, no? At least as long as we have a separate egraph per function, and given that the overall problem we are solving is \"compile this CLIF to machine code\"? Or it's possible I'm missing some other way of batching or amortization that you mean to suggest...</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm happy to help hack on the fork if that's useful.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>as long as we have a separate egraph per function</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As long the e-graph optimization workflow is per-function, you can't really amortize. The batching I'm talking about is across functions: there's nothing stopping you from adding 1000 functions to the same e-graph (hopefully there's some sharing in there!) and optimizing them simultaneously. I suspect that even just adding 1000 functions to one e-graph is faster than adding 1000 functions to 1000 e-graphs because there is likely some sharing, but I could be wrong here.</p>\n<p>Obviously one e-graph per function is cleaner for how the optimization workflow is right now. It just comes with the unfortunate overhead of basically copying your whole program twice: once into the e-graph and once out. Even outside of batching, another way of improving performance would be to eliminate one or both of these copies by increasing the part of the pipeline where you use e-graphs, ideally to some other \"translation\" boundary where you'd have to lower to another IR anyway. This is clearly a big task, though.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

And, actually, now that these two ideas are next to each other: putting the inlining and inlined function in the same egraph, linking up the dataflow, and then elaborating out of that is a <em>really nice</em> clean way of doing inlining. So, you've spawned some thoughts here, thanks!</p>\n<p>One potentially complicating factor toward deduplicating efficiency between function bodies is that the \"roots\" (terminal nodes) will differ: both <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> may contain <code>complex_expr(x, y, z)</code> but where <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> are <em>different</em> block params, or side-effecting ops (calls, loads), or whatever, in the two functions. I wonder if there is some sort of canonicalization that could help (in the extreme case this feels like a graph isomorphism problem though). In the egraph literature I mostly see expressions in terms of variable terminals <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, etc and so this doesn't seem to be as big a deal. Any thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>",

All of this is to implement the principles (i) O(1) memory allocations, i.e. we should grow single large containers rather than have nested containers per node or eclass (entity-component-system style) and (ii) avoid copies and store nodes only once. There's a little more we could do in theory with a custom hashmap that doesn't require <code>Hash</code>+<code>Eq</code> (namely, allows us to provide context for those; that would allow us to provide the backing pool separately and not store a fat-pointer slice for args and types in every <code>Node</code>, but only a <code>u32</code> index).</p>\n<p>I haven't built the merging or rule-application bits yet but the roundtripping (without any rule applications) actually never merges eclasses so this is enough to evaluate the overhead of this part of the pipeline.</p>\n<p>Given this, and given that GVN+LICM add around 10% to compile time, I'm actually cautiously optimistic that we can slip into the hole left by removing these stages and be almost neutral when no rewrite rules are applied. That's the ideal case in my mind. Or at least have small enough overhead that this roundtrip is always on when opts are on. Later we can remove half the roundtrip by generating egraph nodes straight from the frontend/builder API, as noted in the last section of the RFC (and as you note as well @mwillsey) for further savings, but for now anchoring both ends of the transform in CLIF (which can be printed, manipulated, used for testing, etc) has substantial pragmatic benefits I think.</p>\n<p>(I'm not sure if the path forward is to actually use <code>cranelift-egraph</code> or <code>egg</code> with a bunch of hacks; as a general principle I don't like to go all NIH and hack up my own versions of things; but the data structures and tradeoffs are different enough that this may be the right way, I'm not sure. Right now I just want to pathfind wrt \"is this performance profile possible\".)</p>\n<p>After dropping this tidbit I'm now promptly going to disappear for a week of PTO (...sorry!) but wanted to get that data point out first.

We prototyped it at some point, and found it was slower because the rules we were using didn't significantly \"overlap\".

My experience in the past is that trying to paper over such details to give a nice high-level view can sometimes be counterproductive because it either creates subtle bugs, or sweeps efficiency concerns under the rug.

testcase.)</p>\n<p>This is using a new acyclic-egraph approach that I'm calling the \"aegraph\" (or ægraph for those who love digraphs). I got the conventional egraph rewriting to work last week, and measured it and found compilation time was inflating significantly once rewrites occur -- something like 5x. I then had a series of realizations that the way that we're using egraphs here is more limited than perhaps a conventional full-equality-saturation approach, and had a series of realizations about simplifications we could make.</p>\n<p>Basically an ægraph contains eclasses as nodes where each node contains an enode, an enode and a parent-eclass pointer, or two parent-eclass pointers. The union operation joins two eclasses together only by adding nodes (or as an optimization, replacing an enode node with an enode-and-parent node). An eclass node can refer only to earlier eclasses. We maintain the acyclicity invariant when adding enodes and unioning eclasses. Rule application occurs immediately when a new node is added. In a sense, eclasses are split into \"levels\" and a given level of an eclass refers only to the levels of argument eclasses that existed when it was created. It's thus a persistent immutable data structure. An eclass is represented by the id of its <em>latest</em> version (highest id), whereas the traditional union-find approach tends to push ids downward to the lowest id.</p>\n<p>This data structure has some really compelling properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Because eclass nodes are immutable once created, we only need to apply rules to a node once. This \"single pass\" rule application is at the heart of its speed.</li>\n<li>We don't re-canonicalize and re-intern enodes, so we don't need parent pointers and we don't need a rebuild step.</li>\n<li>It plays really nicely with the scoped elaboration, in that we can keep a parallel scoped map with the \"best node\" (extraction information) and memoize; extraction doesn't need cycle removal any more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tradeoff is that it's not at all a full equality saturation (see above re: no recanonicalization). But I think that's OK for our use-case: we mainly (i) introduce new expressions then (ii) apply rules that introduce alternate forms of those expressions, and union them together.  In this case the ægraph is pretty ideal: it's like a streaming journal of nodes and we add a new node from the build, then add a few more nodes that are equivalent to it and union them in-place, then keep going, referring to the just-built expression by the latest id. So the ægraph is sort of a \"multi-version IR\" where every value can have multiple representations, combined with GVN.</p>\n<p>(The case it misses that a traditional egraph with parent pointers, recanonicalization, and the rebuild step would get is where we introduce some node A that gets a new eclass, a rewrite rule adds a node B and unions it with A, and B happens to dedup to an already-existing eclass. The new ID for A will point to a union node that joins A and B's existing eclass, but other users of B will not see A because it's \"newer\". This seems to be of limited use <em>for our specific rules</em> because our rewrite rules <em>tend</em> to go from more expensive/complex expressions to simpler ones, so A is likely not better than B. That's not always the case and I'm sure there are cases where a full egraph does do better. But the multiple-version-representation and ability of rules to match on all versions seems like the key thing that we want from the data structure.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'll write this up more properly but that's where I'm at now: a prototype that works and is fast. I'll add a bit more to it (integration with alias analysis! and other rules I haven't added yet) and then start to look at generated code quality too.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It's kind of a mixed bag -- tl;dr, code quality matches existing Cranelift (all optimizations have been reproduced), compilation speed is ~1-5% slower. Theoretical benefits of everything-in-one-fixpoint (GVN and alias analysis and LICM and algebraic simplifications all cooperating) work in filetests, but don't seem to do much to Wasm-based benchmarks in Sightglass.</p>\n<p>So the current status of the WIP branch is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"acyclic egraph\" (ægraph) implementation is working;</li>\n<li>producing and lowering out of this aegraph works fine;</li>\n<li>ISLE-based rewrite rules operate on this aegraph, and cost-based extraction picks the best option for each node after rewrites are done;<ul>\n<li>rewrites in the aegraph apply immediately (because of acyclicity, there's no need to revisit a node);</li>\n<li>ISLE itself has been extended to support \"multiplicity\" in extractors and constructors, so multiple rules can match and matchers on eclass IDs see all available enodes for each eclass;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The aegraph construction and \"scoped elaboration\" subsume GVN (global value numbering, a form of common-subexpression elimination) by means of the deduplication map;</li>\n<li>The aegraph elaboration automatically does LICM (loop-invariant code motion) implicitly, by way of loop-nest awareness when traversing the domtree;</li>\n<li>The alias analysis feeds into the rewrite rules and there are rules for redundant-load elimination and store-to-load forwarding;</li>\n<li>Rewrite rules have been written for a bunch of constant-propagation and algebraic-simplification cases, and some other slightly more ad-hoc ones (e.g. reassociating loads to try to make LICM on partially-loop-invariant sums work)</li>\n<li>A simple form of rematerialization has been implemented, where adds-with-one-immediate, and immediates themselves, are regenerated in the block they are used rather than maximally hoisted by GVN, in order to reduce register pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All this works -- and IMHO the data structures and algorithms are pretty beautiful actually! -- but it's not any <em>faster</em>. It is <em>nicer</em> to update with more rewrite rules -- see <a href=\"https://github.com/cfallin/wasmtime/blob/cfc1137fc3efae06e7753a158b6fae6b17686b0c/cranelift/codegen/src/opts/cprop.isle\">cprop.isle</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/cfallin/wasmtime/blob/cfc1137fc3efae06e7753a158b6fae6b17686b0c/cranelift/codegen/src/opts/algebraic.isle\">algebraic.isle</a> -- and if it were completely at parity performance-wise, this would be an interesting benefit still IMHO. But there is still a small compile-time penalty, around 5% on average, with everything above incorporated.</p>\n<p>I have some more thoughts in my <a href=\"https://github.com/cfallin/wasmtime/blob/cfc1137fc3efae06e7753a158b6fae6b17686b0c/TODO\">running TODO list</a> but most of the remaining ones are for compile speed, not code quality (runtime speed).</p>\n<p>Given all that, I think I'm running up against a wall that's actually mostly supported by some other limits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is actually not a ton of remaining \"low-hanging fruit\" when running Wasm modules produced by an optimizing compiler. (Any strength reduction or other clever \"instcombine\"-type optimization I would expect to be done by LLVM before producing the <code>.wasm</code>.)</li>\n<li>Lowering, once it occurs, disallows any further optimizations, because we can't edit VCode currently.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first is just a fact of our benchmarking conditions (but we're oriented this way because we care very much about Wasm performance -- we can't just choose to focus on poorly-optimized CLIF instead and say \"see look opts work!\"). But the second is where a lot of my thoughts are going lately. In other words, from first principles, if we start with highly-optimized Wasm bytecode, where do we expect inefficiencies and redundancies to creep in? Probably one of the three areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The semantic gap between Wasm bytecode and CLIF, and how it is bridged (heap bounds checks, table accesses, and the like);</li>\n<li>The semantic gap between CLIF and the machine, and how it is bridged (our lowering rules in our backends);</li>\n<li>regalloc quality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My forehead is already dented from banging against item 3 (regalloc quality) for a long time, and item 1 (Wasm to CLIF) is largely addressed already by designing CLIF semantics to be close to those of Wasm; but item 2 (lowering) presents unharvested opportunities IMHO.</p>\n<p>In looking at disassemblies of \"hot blocks\" when profiling runtime I see a lot of not-great code, and it comes in several varieties: redundant flags computations (cmp / setnp / cmp / sete for float comparisons is a common one); redundant trap conditions that cprop could optimize away, or GVN could combine between multiple ops; address-mode junk produced by our \"match up the operand tree and then regenerate an <code>add</code> tree for the parts we can't incorporate\" logic in both x64 and aarch64; a bunch of \"spill x+1, x+3, x+10, x+15 to separate spillslots for use later\" (hence my attempt at remat above); and others. A lot of this comes from the inability to optimize code once we lower a CLIF op into multiple MachInsts, or one pseudo-MachInst.</p>\n<p>(Those who have been around a while might be screaming: legalization and post-opt! Yes, you're right. I think we threw out some of the value of those in exchange for the speed and simplicity of the single-pass lowering, and the real value that we <em>do</em> get from a two-level IR. But we lost something too.)</p>\n<p>So: I'm taking a little time to think about what might make sense as a way to optimize VCode. I <em>don't</em> think this means throwing out the aegraph and ISLE-based mid-end framework; I think instead there may be a way to write some mid-end legalizations that do a lot of expansion that we currently do in lowering, and then let lowering be simpler; or in the extreme, even have a <code>Node::MachInst { ... }</code> in the aegraph, though that has potential efficiency issues. More thought needed.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'd love to hear more thoughts on this, and we can talk about it more in the next Cranelift meeting, but there's my report on what I've learned in the last few weeks :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",

#27</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I did some optimization on compiler runtime tonight -- both low-level things like inline pragmas, refactoring some data structures to allow holding borrows rather than lookups, using dense rather than sparse maps in places, preallocating with correct sizes, and similar, and high-level things like algorithmic improvements to memoize more, trim the extraction search space (running upper bound and early exit/pruning), \"subsume\" all nodes in an eclass with one \"final\" version (for e.g. cprop), and the like.</p>\n<p>In the end I got SpiderMonkey.wasm down to a ~1% compile-time regression (relative to baseline Cranelift), and bz2.wasm to a... 15% compile-time <em>speedup</em> (yeah, I know; it's wild; I was focusing entirely on SpiderMonkey and then just checked bz2 now, and would have fallen off my chair if gravity were slightly stronger):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span

I'm definitely curious what other design points may be possible here. I suspect that benefits of more strongly normalizing approaches (full recanonicalize/rebuild as in a traditional egraph or egg) will become more apparent the more we add interesting rules. Right now I have rules I wrote with my traditional-compiler-author brain, so mostly constant prop and the like where the right-hand side is unambiguously better. (There are a few cases of reassociation where I let the extractor do the right thing though, and also scoped elaboration can make things interesting when another expression forces evaluation of some otherwise-expensive node, shorting its cost to 0 for subsequent uses and altering the best choice. (This is why extraction is done lazily and memoized.) In those cases I suspect having multiple versions around actually helps.)</p>\n<p>There are definitely some experiments I'd like to run, if I were to put on my old grad-student hat (it has collected some dust!) -- among them, putting together a full rebuild step as @oflatt suggests, and maybe also a \"rewrites always subsume\" mode (ie no multi-version capability) with the rules. My day-job means I need to focus on getting this \"makes compiler faster and better\" magic into production shape first, of course, but I do want to experiment some as time allows :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",

Yet another egg contributor here. @mwillsey and I had a great chat with Nico Bruno, who was a main engineer of SQLServer. It turns out one main difference between equality saturation and <a href=\"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/infolab/Data/Courses/CS632/Papers/Cascades-graefe.pdf\">cascade-style</a> DB query optimization is that the latter maintains the acyclicity of the e-graph, just like aegraph. Acyclicity enables many powerful optimizations like branch-and-bound, and usually runs very fast. I highly recommend checking out some of the literature there, as well as some modern implementations like <a href=\"https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/sql/opt/doc.go\">cockroach</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/greenplum-db/gporca\">orca</a>. </p>\n</blockquote>",

A full writeup of how ægraphs work is IMHO out-of-scope here but I will include a bunch of detail somewhere in <code>cranelift/codegen/docs/</code> if this merges. The important decision points here, IMHO, are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should we have a mid-end?</li>\n<li>Should it operate based on rewriting rules?</li>\n<li>Is an implementation based on the prototype acceptable, given its numbers (with polish in a bunch of production details before merging)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'd like to kick off a round of discussion and (hopefully!) consensus-building on that. Happy to talk more about this in the next Cranelift meeting but let's see what folks think here first. Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
