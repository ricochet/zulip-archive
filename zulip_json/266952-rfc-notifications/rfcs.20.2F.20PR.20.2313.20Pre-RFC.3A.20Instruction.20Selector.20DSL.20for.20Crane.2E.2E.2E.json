Rather, the goal here is to collect requirements, discuss different design choices and how they might work in our context, and generally to see what the community thinks about this and what folks might prefer.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This would allow for complex output code to handle for example turning fixed divisions into multiplications or shifts while still preserving analyzability and optimizability of the patterns if desired.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We should be able to do the superoptimization offline, based on CLIF patterns that we've harvested from real world programs, and then take the learned CLIF-&gt;vcode pairs and dump them into our new DSL. We should be able to effectively fold the preopt pass (and many more peepholes!) into isel lowering.</p>\n<p>This would give us</p>\n<ul>\n<li>better compilation throughput because we have fewer passes over the clif,</li>\n<li>correct by construction CLIF-&gt;vcode patterns, and</li>\n<li>optimal (according to some cost function) code generation for these CLIF-&gt;vcode patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
