We should probably have a defined standard for \"stable link to an RFC\": do we link to the PR itself (and then keep an up-to-date link in the PR's first comment to the final markdown path)? Or something else?</p>\n</blockquote>",

From then on the RFC name/path shouldn't need to ever change and a link to the PR or the file can be used to identify it permanently.</p>\n<p>As for handling existing links to RFC files that would no longer be correct, the only way to avoid breaking them that I can think of is to make the accepted folder essentially an archive keeping all of the files therein but replacing the contents of each with a link to the actual RFC in some new folder where all of the files are numbered. The issue being that this would make the structure of the RFCs repo a awkward/confusing.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to estimate the amount of these links that exist in the wild?</p>\n</blockquote>",
