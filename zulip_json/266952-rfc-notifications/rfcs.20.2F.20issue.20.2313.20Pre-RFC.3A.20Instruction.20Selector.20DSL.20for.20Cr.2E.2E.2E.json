Maaaayyyybe a little bit of overhead related to icache because there are now two code paths rather than one, but I wouldn't expect too much.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The latter is especially interesting to me as it will let us eventually move to the native SSA-based API of <a href=\"http://bytecodealliance/regalloc2\">regalloc2</a> which should give some speedups.</p>\n<p>I've got a reasonable design down on paper now and am working on refining the writeup before posting the RFC -- hope to have it up in the next few days :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",
