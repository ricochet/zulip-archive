The caller is indeed ambiguous and will ideally go away once interface types obviates exporting \"memory\". The callee, however, is pretty fundamental. Wasm functions need their instances.</p>\n<p>The use case I'm thinking of is: an API which has some state associated with it. If two parts of an application each want to use that API, independently of the other, they should be able to have independent copies of the state. Ideally, we want host APIs to act as much like wasm APIs as possible, so that we can easily switch between host and polyfill implementations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That said, if we keep it on the Store, it's true that all instances using the Wasi host functions added at the engine-level will share the same WasiCxt context. But that still does not preclude users from being able to call Wasi::add_to_linker to link in WASI with a different context for a specific instantiation using the same store.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's good that you can do multiple contexts; what I'm asking is, should this be the default way of doing things, and perhaps even the only way? Right now, there's not a lot attached to the store, and the state that is there is well understood, which is a useful property when we think about suspending/resuming/checkpoint-restart/migration/etc. if instances.</p>\n<p>Here's a potentially crazy idea: each imported function has a <code>VMCallerCheckedAnyfunc</code>, which includes a <code>*mut VMContext</code>. But after instantiation and linking are done, one instantace doesn't ever look at the <code>*mut VMContext</code> for another instance. It just just blindly passes the context argument when calling an import. So, what if we generalized this pointer, and said it's no longer just a <code>*mut VMContext</code>, but an arbitrary \"context\" state pointer? For wasm modules, it'd still be the same <code>VMContext</code> pointer, but for host modules, it could be a pointer into whatever type the host wanted? Then we wouldn't even have to figure out how to fit this into <code>Instance</code>.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm curious though how you're thinking that the callee's state is initialized? For per-function state you can always simply capture state via the Rust closure, but the main problem with that is then the state is per-engine rather than per-instance/store. Where would per instance/store state get attached in what you're thinking @sunfishcode? (currently it's <code>set_context</code> for what this currently proposes I believe)</p>\n</blockquote>",
